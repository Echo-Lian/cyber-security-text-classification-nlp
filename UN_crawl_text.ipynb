      "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or UNCRC, is the basis of all of Unicef’s work. It is the most complete statement of children’s rights ever produced and is the most widely-ratified international human rights treaty in history.\n",

      "What makes the UNCRC so special?\n",
      "The Convention has 54 articles that cover all aspects of a child’s life and set out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights that all children everywhere are entitled to. It also explains how adults and governments must work together to make sure all children can enjoy all their rights.\n",
      "Every child has rights, whatever their ethnicity, gender, religion, language, abilities or any other status.\n",
      "The Convention must be seen as a whole: all the rights are linked and no right is more important that another. The right to relax and play (Article 31) and the right to freedom of expression (Article 13) have equal importance as the right to be safe from violence (Article 19) and the right to education (Article 28).\n",
      "We are the only organisation working for children recognised by the Convention.\n",
      "The UNCRC is also the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world – it’s even been accepted by non-state entities, such as the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA), a rebel movement in South Sudan. All UN member states except for the United States have ratified the Convention. The Convention came into force in the UK in 1992.\n",
      "What is in the Convention?\n",
      "You can read the full convention (pdf), or just a summary (pdf), to find out more about the rights that are included.\n",
      "There are four articles in the convention that are seen as special. They’re known as the “General Principles” and they help to interpret all the other articles and play a fundamental role in realising all the rights in the Convention for all children. They are:\n",
      "Non-discrimination (article 2)\n",
      "Best interest of the child (article 3)\n",
      "Right to life survival and development (article 6)\n",
      "Right to be heard (article 12)\n",
      "The Convention also contains a number of agreements to add further unique rights for children which are optional for countries – they are called “Optional Protocols”. They include:\n",
      "The Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict\n",
      "This requires governments to increase the minimum age that children can join the armed forces from 15 years and to ensure that members of their armed forces under the age of 18 do not take a direct part in armed conflict.\n",
      "The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography\n",
      "This provides detailed requirements for governments to end the sexual exploitation and abuse of children. It also protects children from being sold for non-sexual purposes, such as other forms of forced labour, illegal adoption and organ donation.\n",
      "The Optional Protocol on a communications procedure\n",
      "This allows children to submit a complaint to the United Nations when their rights have been violated and their own country’s legal system were not able to offer a solution.\n",

      "A third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child completes the raft of international mechanisms for ensuring children’s rights. However, it also raises unique problems particular to children as rights’ holders and putative rights’ enforcers. For example, children may not know of their rights, they may lack the necessary capacity to initiate enforcement actions and they may encounter problems should they perceive their rights as being contrary to parental wishes. Overcoming such problems is fraught with challenges but not impossible. Strong national mechanisms present a partial solution. Long advocated, they offer possibilities for awareness-raising, neutral representation of the child’s interest before courts, committees and tribunals and ensuring a balance is sought, even achieved, between the rights of the child and those of the parents and State.\n",

      "Conscious of the tenth anniversaries, in the year 2000, of the World Summit for Children and the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and of the symbolic and practical importance of the adoption of the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child before the special session of the General Assembly for the follow-up to the World Summit for Children, to be convened in 2001,\n",

      "The States Parties to the present Protocol,\n",
      "Encouraged by the overwhelming support for the Convention on the Rights of the Child/1, demonstrating the widespread commitment that exists to strive for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child,\n",
      "Reaffirming that the rights of children require special protection, and calling for continuous improvement of the situation of children without distinction, as well as for their development and education in conditions of peace and security,\n",
      "Disturbed by the harmful and widespread impact of armed conflict on children and the long-term consequences this has for durable peace, security and development,\n",
      "Condemning the targeting of children in situations of armed conflict and direct attacks on objects protected under international law, including places generally having a significant presence of children, such as schools and hospitals,\n",
      "Noting the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court#nbsp;/2 and, in particular, its inclusion as a war crime of conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years or using them to participate actively in hostilities in both international and non-international armed conflicts,\n",
      "Considering, therefore, that to strengthen further the implementation of rights recognized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child there is a need to increase the protection of children from involvement in armed conflict,\n",
      "Noting that article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child specifies that, for the purposes of that Convention, a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier,\n",
      "Convinced that an optional protocol to the Convention raising the age of possible recruitment of persons into armed forces and their participation in hostilities will contribute effectively to the implementation of the principle that the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children,\n",
      "Noting that the twenty-sixth international Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in December 1995 recommended, inter alia, that parties to conflict take every feasible step to ensure that children under the age of 18 years do not take part in hostilities,\n",
      "Welcoming the unanimous adoption, in June 1999, of International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which prohibits, inter alia, forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict,\n",
      "Condemning with the gravest concern the recruitment, training and use within and across national borders of children in hostilities by armed groups distinct from the armed forces of a State, and recognizing the responsibility of those who recruit, train and use children in this regard,\n",
      "Recalling the obligation of each party to an armed conflict to abide by the provisions of international humanitarian law,\n",
      "Stressing that this Protocol is without prejudice to the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations, including Article 51, and relevant norms of humanitarian law,\n",
      "Bearing in mind that conditions of peace and security based on full respect of the purposes and principles contained in the Charter and observance of applicable human rights instruments are indispensable for the full protection of children, in particular during armed conflicts and foreign occupation,\n",
      "Recognizing the special needs of those children who are particularly vulnerable to recruitment or use in hostilities contrary to this Protocol owing to their economic or social status or gender,\n",
      "Mindful of the necessity of taking into consideration the economic, social and political root causes of the involvement of children in armed conflicts,\n",
      "Convinced of the need to strengthen international cooperation in the implementation of this Protocol, as well as the physical and psychosocial rehabilitation and social reintegration of children who are victims of armed conflict,\n",
      "Encouraging the participation of the community and, in particular, children and child victims in the dissemination of informational and educational programmes concerning the implementation of the Protocol,\n",
      "Have agreed as follows:\n",
      "Article 1\n",
      "States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities.\n",
      "Article 2\n",
      "States Parties shall ensure that persons who have not attained the age of 18 years are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces.\n",

      "1. States Parties shall raise the minimum age for the voluntary recruitment of persons into their national armed forces from that set out in article 38, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,/1 taking account of the principles contained in that article and recognizing that under the Convention persons under 18 are entitled to special protection.\n",
      "2. Each State Party shall deposit a binding declaration upon ratification of or accession to this Protocol that sets forth the minimum age at which it will permit voluntary recruitment into its national armed forces and a description of the safeguards that it has adopted to ensure that such recruitment is not forced or coerced.\n",
      "3. States Parties that permit voluntary recruitment into their national armed forces under the age of 18 shall maintain safeguards to ensure, as a minimum, that:\n",
      "Such recruitment is genuinely voluntary;\n",
      "Such recruitment is done with the informed consent of the person=s parents or legal guardians;\n",
      "Such persons are fully informed of the duties involved in such military service;\n",
      "Such persons provide reliable proof of age prior to acceptance into national military service.\n",
      "4. Each State Party may strengthen its declaration at any time by notification to that effect addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall inform all States Parties. Such notification shall take effect on the date on which it is received by the Secretary-General.\n",
      "5. The requirement to raise the age in paragraph 1 of the present article does not apply to schools operated by or under the control of the armed forces of the States Parties, in keeping with articles 28 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n",
      "Article 4\n",
      "1. Armed groups that are distinct from the armed forces of a State should not, under any circumstances, recruit or use in hostilities persons under the age of 18 years.\n",
      "2. States Parties shall take all feasible measures to prevent such recruitment and use, including the adoption of legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalize such practices.\n",
      "3. The application of the present article under this Protocol shall not affect the legal status of any party to an armed conflict.\n",
      "Article 5\n",
      "Nothing in the present Protocol shall be construed as precluding provisions in the law of a State Party or in international instruments and international humanitarian law that are more conducive to the realization of the rights of the child.\n",
      "Article 6\n",
      "1. Each State Party shall take all necessary legal, administrative and other measures to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this Protocol within its jurisdiction.\n",
      "2. States Parties undertake to make the principles and provisions of the present Protocol widely known and promoted by appropriate means, to adults and children alike.\n",
      "3. States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons within their jurisdiction recruited or used in hostilities contrary to this Protocol are demobilized or otherwise released from service. States Parties shall, when necessary, accord to these persons all appropriate assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and their social reintegration.\n",
      "Article 7\n",
      "1. States Parties shall cooperate in the implementation of the present Protocol, including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the Protocol and in the rehabilitation and social reintegration of persons who are victims of acts contrary to this Protocol, including through technical cooperation and financial assistance. Such assistance and cooperation will be undertaken in consultation with concerned States Parties and relevant international organizations.\n",
      "2. States Parties in a position to do so shall provide such assistance through existing multilateral, bilateral or other programmes, or, inter alia, through a voluntary fund established in accordance with the rules of the General Assembly.\n",
      "Article 8\n",
      "1. Each State Party shall submit, within two years following the entry into force of the Protocol for that State Party, a report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child providing comprehensive information on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Protocol, including the measures taken to implement the provisions on participation and recruitment.\n",
      "2. Following the submission of the comprehensive report, each State Party shall include in the reports they submit to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in accordance with article 44 of the Convention, any further information with respect to the implementation of the Protocol. Other States Parties to the Protocol shall submit a report every five years.\n",
      "3. The Committee on the Rights of the Child may request from States Parties further information relevant to the implementation of this Protocol.\n",
      "Article 9\n",
      "1. The present Protocol is open for signature by any State that is a party to the Convention or has signed it.\n",
      "2. The present Protocol is subject to ratification and is open to accession by any State. Instruments of ratification or accession shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n",
      "3. The Secretary-General, in his capacity as depositary of the Convention and the Protocol, shall inform all States Parties to the Convention and all States that have signed the Convention of each instrument of declaration pursuant to article 13.\n",
      "Article 10\n",
      "1. The present Protocol shall enter into force three months after the deposit of the tenth instrument of ratification or accession.\n",
      "2. For each State ratifying the present Protocol or acceding to it after its entry into force, the present Protocol shall enter into force one month after the date of the deposit of its own instrument of ratification or accession.\n",
      "Article 11\n",
      "1. Any State Party may denounce the present Protocol at any time by written notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall thereafter inform the other States Parties to the Convention and all States that have signed the Convention. The denunciation shall take effect one year after the date of receipt of the notification by the Secretary-General. If, however, on the expiry of that year the denouncing State Party is engaged in armed conflict, the denunciation shall not take effect before the end of the armed conflict.\n",
      "2. Such a denunciation shall not have the effect of releasing the State Party from its obligations under the present Protocol in regard to any act that occurs prior to the date on which the denunciation becomes effective. Nor shall such a denunciation prejudice in any way the continued consideration of any matter that is already under consideration by the Committee prior to the date on which the denunciation becomes effective.\n",
      "Article 12\n",
      "1. Any State Party may propose an amendment and file it with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Secretary-General shall thereupon communicate the proposed amendment to States Parties, with a request that they indicate whether they favour a conference of States Parties for the purpose of considering and voting upon the proposals. In the event that, within four months from the date of such communication, at least one third of the States Parties favour such a conference, the Secretary-General shall convene the conference under the auspices of the United Nations. Any amendment adopted by a majority of States Parties present and voting at the conference shall be submitted to the General Assembly for approval.\n",
      "2. An amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of the present article shall enter into force when it has been approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations and accepted by a two-thirds majority of States Parties.\n",
      "3. When an amendment enters into force, it shall be binding on those States Parties that have accepted it, other States Parties still being bound by the provisions of the present Protocol and any earlier amendments that they have accepted.\n",
      "Article 13\n",
      "1. The present Protocol, of which the Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish texts are equally authentic, shall be deposited in the archives of the United Nations.\n",
      "2. The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall transmit certified copies of the present Protocol to all States Parties to the Convention and all States that have signed the Convention.\n",
      "Annex II\n",
      "Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography\n",
      "The States Parties to the present Protocol,\n",
      "Considering that, in order further to achieve the purposes of the Convention on the Rights of the Child/1 and the implementation of its provisions, especially articles 1, 11, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36, it would be appropriate to extend the measures that States Parties should undertake in order to guarantee the protection of the child from the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,\n",
      "Considering also that the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child=s education, or to be harmful to the child=s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development,\n",
      "Gravely concerned at the significant and increasing international traffic of children for the purpose of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,\n",
      "Deeply concerned at the widespread and continuing practice of sex tourism, to which children are especially vulnerable, as it directly promotes the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,\n",
      "Recognizing that a number of particularly vulnerable groups, including girl children, are at greater risk of sexual exploitation, and that girl children are disproportionately represented among the sexually exploited,\n",
      "Concerned about the growing availability of child pornography on the Internet and other evolving technologies, and recalling the International Conference on Combating Child Pornography on the Internet (Vienna, 1999) and, in particular, its conclusion calling for the worldwide criminalization of the production, distribution, exportation, transmission, importation, intentional possession and advertising of child pornography, and stressing the importance of closer cooperation and partnership between Governments and the Internet industry,\n",
      "Believing that the elimination of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography will be facilitated by adopting a holistic approach, addressing the contributing factors, including underdevelopment, poverty, economic disparities, inequitable socio-economic structure, dysfunctioning families, lack of education, urban-rural migration, gender discrimination, irresponsible adult sexual behaviour, harmful traditional practices, armed conflicts and trafficking of children,\n",
      "Believing that efforts to raise public awareness are needed to reduce consumer demand for the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and also believing in the importance of strengthening global partnership among all actors and of improving law enforcement at the national level,\n",
      "Noting the provisions of international legal instruments relevant to the protection of children, including the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation with Respect to Inter-Country Adoption, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, and International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour,\n",
      "Encouraged by the overwhelming support for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, demonstrating the widespread commitment that exists for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child,\n",
      "Recognizing the importance of the implementation of the provisions of the Programme of Action for the Prevention of the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography/3 and the Declaration and Agenda for Action adopted at the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held at Stockholm from 27 to 31 August 1996,/4 and the other relevant decisions and recommendations of pertinent international bodies,\n",
      "Taking due account of the importance of the traditions and cultural values of each people for the protection and harmonious development of the child,\n",
      "Have agreed as follows:\n",
      "Article 1\n",
      "States Parties shall prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography as provided for by the present Protocol.\n",
      "Article 2\n",
      "For the purpose of the present Protocol:\n",
      "Sale of children means any act or transaction whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another for remuneration or any other consideration;\n",
      "Child prostitution means the use of a child in sexual activities for remuneration or any other form of consideration;\n",
      "Child pornography means any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes.\n",
      "Article 3\n",
      "1. Each State Party shall ensure that, as a minimum, the following acts and activities are fully covered under its criminal or penal law, whether these offences are committed domestically or transnationally or on an individual or organized basis:\n",
      "In the context of sale of children as defined in article 2:\n",
      "The offering, delivering or accepting, by whatever means, a child for the purpose of:\n",
      "a. Sexual exploitation of the child;\n",
      "b. Transfer of organs of the child for profit;\n",
      "c. Engagement of the child in forced labour;\n",

      "Submitting a complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child\n",
      "The UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force in Finland on 12 February 2016. Children and groups of children under the jurisdiction of a State party have the right to submit complaints to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which supervises the implementation of the Convention, if they consider the State party to be acting in breach of their rights as recognised under the Convention or the two Optional Protocols relating to its contents.  The Committee on the Rights of the Child will issue a statement and, if necessary, recommendations on the basis of complaints that it accepts for investigation.\n",
      "Optional Protocol in the Finlex database\n",
      "This page includes a brief description of the main elements involved when submitting individual complaints. The articles refer to the clauses of the Optional Protocol. The precise text of the Protocol can be checked from the Finnish translation available via the above link.\n",
      "Who can submit a complaint?\n",
      "Article 5\n",
      "an individual i.e. the child itself\n",
      "a group of children\n",
      "someone else on behalf of a child or group of children, if this person has the child’s/children’s consent or can give grounds for acting on behalf of the child/children without their consent.\n",
      "On what kinds of issues can a complaint be submitted?\n",
      "Article 5\n",
      "A complaint can be submitted on an issue concerning which the complainant believes that the Finnish state has infringed his or her rights, where this is confirmed\n",
      "in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or\n",
      "the Optional Protocols to the Convention\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the Involvement of children in armed conflict\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography\n",
      "When can a complaint be submitted?\n",
      "Article 7\n",
      "Complaints can be submitted in the case of an infringement of rights occurring after 12 February 2016 or, if the violation had already begun before 12 February 2016, it must have continued thereafter. This is the date of the entry into force of the complaint procedure in Finland.\n",
      "Before filing a complaint with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, redress must be sought through all existing domestic remedies. This means, for example, that appeals have been made on the matter as far as possible under Finnish law, which in most cases means all the way up to the Supreme Court or the Supreme Administrative Court. You may also submit a complaint if proceedings in a court of law take an unreasonably long time or no effective legal remedy, by which the violation of the right can be redressed, is available.\n",
      "Any complaint must be submitted to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child no later than one year after all effective legal remedies have been sought in the home country i.e. after a final verdict has been given on the issue in the Supreme Court or the Supreme Administrative Court, for example.  Exceptions can be made if the complainant has a valid reason for having been unable to submit a complaint at an earlier time.\n",
      "The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will not accept a complaint for investigation if it has already examined the same issue or the issue is already being, or has been, handled in another international investigation or settlement procedure. For example, this means that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will not handle a complaint which the European Court of Human Rights has already decided to process.\n",
      "How to submit a complaint\n",
      "Article 7\n",
      "A complaint must be submitted in writing in English or in any of the UN’s other official languages i.e. Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, French or Russian.\n",
      "The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has drawn up a form, which should be used for assistance when filing a complaint. It is important that all of the questions on the form are answered carefully. Among other matters, the complaint should specify whose rights have been violated and give a detailed explanation of what happened.\n",
      "You can find the English-language form, which also includes brief instructions on filing a complaint and the address to which the complaint can be sent, online\n",
      "http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CRC/ModelCommunicationForm_en.pdf\n",
      "How is a complaint handled by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child?\n",
      "Articles 9, 10 and 11\n",
      "When an appeal is received by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee begins by assessing whether the complaint is of a type which it can investigate. Among other issues, the Committee clarifies whether the complaint has been made in writing, whether it bears the name of the complainant and whether it has been made on sufficient grounds.\n",
      "The Committee’s primary aim is to help the parties (the complainant and the State party) to arrive at an amicable solution. If this is achieved, the handling of the complaint concludes with the acceptance of the solution. Otherwise, the Committee will continue to handle the issue.\n",
      "Complaints are handled confidentially by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in meetings in which no unauthorised persons can participate. They are also treated confidentially by the State party, from which the Committee will request a report on the issues described in the complaint.\n",
      "Once the Committee has processed the complaint, it will give its opinion and any recommendations on the issue to the State party and complainant, for example on how the State party might compensate the complainant for the violation of its rights, or how similar violations could be prevented in the future.  The State party should inform the Committee, within six months, of what measures it has taken or intends to take in response to the Committee’s statements or recommendations.\n",
      " Where to get help in submitting a complaint?\n",
      "For further details on submitting a complaint, turn to the Unit for Human Rights Courts and Conventions of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Contact information http://formin.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=289810&nodeid=15997&contentlan=2&culture=en-US\n",

      "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out the basic human rights to which children everywhere are entitled. These include:\n",
      "The right to survival\n",
      "The right to the development of their full physical and mental potential\n",
      "The right to protection from influences that are harmful to their development\n",
      "The right to participation in family, cultural and social life\n",
      "The Convention protects these rights by setting minimum standards that governments must meet in providing healthcare, education and legal and social services to children in their countries.\n",
      "The Convention entered into force in September 1990. Ireland ratified the Convention in 1992.\n",
      "In 2002, two Optional Protocols to the Convention came into force:\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography\n",

      "Committee on the Rights of the Child\n",
      "The Committee on the Rights of the Child is a United Nations (UN) body of 18 Independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by the countries that are party to it. It also monitors implementation of the two Optional Protocols.\n",
      "The countries are obliged to submit regular reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. They must submit an initial report two years after acceding to the Convention and then periodic reports every five years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the country in the form of concluding observations. Ireland submitted its most recent report in 2013.\n",
      "Third Optional Protocol\n",
      "An Optional Protocol on a communications procedure (pdf) came into effect in Ireland on 24 December 2014. The Protocol allows individual children, or those acting on their behalf, to submit complaints regarding specific violations of their rights under the Convention and its first two Optional Protocols directly to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n",
      "A decision by the Committee on a complaint is non-binding on a country. As a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Ireland is answerable to the United Nations for its implementation of the Convention.\n",
      "The rules of the procedure are available on the UN Human Rights website.\n",
      "You can find more information on the Protocol on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs website.\n",
      "Making a complaint\n",
      "A complaint may be submitted to the Committee by a child (or a group of children) claiming to be a victim of a violation of the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols. A complaint may also be submitted by their designated representative, or by others acting on behalf of the alleged victim with their consent. Where there is a concern that the victim’s consent may be the result of improper pressure or inducement, the Committee may request additional information to ensure that the complaint is in the best interests of the child.\n",
      "A complaint may be submitted on behalf of the alleged victim without their consent - in this case, the representative will have to justify submitting the complaint.\n",
      "The Committee will not accept a complaint if:\n",
      "It is anonymous\n",
      "It is not in writing\n",
      "It constitutes an abuse of the right of submission of such complaints or is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols\n",
      "The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement\n",
      "All available domestic remedies have not been exhausted unless the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to bring effective relief\n",
      "The complaint is manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated\n",
      "The facts that are the subject of the complaint occurred prior to the entry into force of the third Protocol for the country concerned, unless those facts continued after that date\n",

      "Drawing on the contributions of several academic disciplines including law, psychology, sociology, history, educational and health sciences, economy and anthropology, an interdisciplinary approach guides the student into a selection of critical issues concerning children’s rights. Participants will gain insight relative to the development of this specific human rights category, as well as to the evolution of the challenges faced by children over time and society’s efforts to respond. Successful international strategies and programs promoting children’s rights will be highlighted, as well as the role of key actors involved in international organizations working in this field. This open online course provides an overview of the most important features of children’s human rights. A central portion of the MOOC will consist of a presentation of the international and regional standards on children’s rights and the related international and regional judicial and quasi-judicial bodies designed to ensure their implementation. No prerequisites or specific background is required to register for this MOOC. The course is conceived as an introductory level program, but participants, who wish to deepen their knowledge in the field of children’s rights, or already have some prior knowledge, will have access to additional reading material on a weekly basis. Participants who successfully complete the class activities and final assessment may request a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the Instructor and the main professors responsible for the program. However, no credits are awarded. The course consists of seven topical modules distributed on 4 weeks. English is the only language of instruction.\n",

      "International standards and monitoring systems\n",
      "The module begins with the presentation of the background, origins and main content of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and provides details about the preparatory work and the international political context in which the Convention was drafted. The content of international human rights norms are discussed using the subdivision between civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on the other. Furthermore, the general UN human rights monitoring mechanisms will be introduced, followed by the presentation of the CRC monitoring system. A discussion on the importance of regional human rights monitoring systems for children in Africa, Asia and Latin America will be the subject of a specific round table. Within the monitoring framework a particular attention is dedicated to role of key actors: Independent National Human Rights Institutions (INHRIs) on Children’s rights, Non-Governmental organizations (NGOs) and children.\n",

      "Submitting a complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child\n",
      "The UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force in Finland on 12 February 2016. Children and groups of children under the jurisdiction of a State party have the right to submit complaints to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which supervises the implementation of the Convention, if they consider the State party to be acting in breach of their rights as recognised under the Convention or the two Optional Protocols relating to its contents.  The Committee on the Rights of the Child will issue a statement and, if necessary, recommendations on the basis of complaints that it accepts for investigation.\n",
      "Optional Protocol in the Finlex database\n",
      "This page includes a brief description of the main elements involved when submitting individual complaints. The articles refer to the clauses of the Optional Protocol. The precise text of the Protocol can be checked from the Finnish translation available via the above link.\n",
      "Who can submit a complaint?\n",
      "Article 5\n",
      "an individual i.e. the child itself\n",
      "a group of children\n",
      "someone else on behalf of a child or group of children, if this person has the child’s/children’s consent or can give grounds for acting on behalf of the child/children without their consent.\n",
      "On what kinds of issues can a complaint be submitted?\n",
      "Article 5\n",
      "A complaint can be submitted on an issue concerning which the complainant believes that the Finnish state has infringed his or her rights, where this is confirmed\n",
      "in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or\n",
      "the Optional Protocols to the Convention\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the Involvement of children in armed conflict\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography\n",
      "When can a complaint be submitted?\n",
      "Article 7\n",
      "Complaints can be submitted in the case of an infringement of rights occurring after 12 February 2016 or, if the violation had already begun before 12 February 2016, it must have continued thereafter. This is the date of the entry into force of the complaint procedure in Finland.\n",
      "Before filing a complaint with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, redress must be sought through all existing domestic remedies. This means, for example, that appeals have been made on the matter as far as possible under Finnish law, which in most cases means all the way up to the Supreme Court or the Supreme Administrative Court. You may also submit a complaint if proceedings in a court of law take an unreasonably long time or no effective legal remedy, by which the violation of the right can be redressed, is available.\n",
      "Any complaint must be submitted to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child no later than one year after all effective legal remedies have been sought in the home country i.e. after a final verdict has been given on the issue in the Supreme Court or the Supreme Administrative Court, for example.  Exceptions can be made if the complainant has a valid reason for having been unable to submit a complaint at an earlier time.\n",
      "The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will not accept a complaint for investigation if it has already examined the same issue or the issue is already being, or has been, handled in another international investigation or settlement procedure. For example, this means that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will not handle a complaint which the European Court of Human Rights has already decided to process.\n",
      "How to submit a complaint\n",
      "Article 7\n",
      "A complaint must be submitted in writing in English or in any of the UN’s other official languages i.e. Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, French or Russian.\n",
      "The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has drawn up a form, which should be used for assistance when filing a complaint. It is important that all of the questions on the form are answered carefully. Among other matters, the complaint should specify whose rights have been violated and give a detailed explanation of what happened.\n",
      "You can find the English-language form, which also includes brief instructions on filing a complaint and the address to which the complaint can be sent, online\n",
      "http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CRC/ModelCommunicationForm_en.pdf\n",
      "How is a complaint handled by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child?\n",
      "Articles 9, 10 and 11\n",
      "When an appeal is received by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee begins by assessing whether the complaint is of a type which it can investigate. Among other issues, the Committee clarifies whether the complaint has been made in writing, whether it bears the name of the complainant and whether it has been made on sufficient grounds.\n",
      "The Committee’s primary aim is to help the parties (the complainant and the State party) to arrive at an amicable solution. If this is achieved, the handling of the complaint concludes with the acceptance of the solution. Otherwise, the Committee will continue to handle the issue.\n",
      "Complaints are handled confidentially by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in meetings in which no unauthorised persons can participate. They are also treated confidentially by the State party, from which the Committee will request a report on the issues described in the complaint.\n",
      "Once the Committee has processed the complaint, it will give its opinion and any recommendations on the issue to the State party and complainant, for example on how the State party might compensate the complainant for the violation of its rights, or how similar violations could be prevented in the future.  The State party should inform the Committee, within six months, of what measures it has taken or intends to take in response to the Committee’s statements or recommendations.\n",
      " Where to get help in submitting a complaint?\n",
      "For further details on submitting a complaint, turn to the Unit for Human Rights Courts and Conventions of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Contact information http://formin.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=289810&nodeid=15997&contentlan=2&culture=en-US\n",

      "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out the basic human rights to which children everywhere are entitled. These include:\n",
      "The right to survival\n",
      "The right to the development of their full physical and mental potential\n",
      "The right to protection from influences that are harmful to their development\n",
      "The right to participation in family, cultural and social life\n",
      "The Convention protects these rights by setting minimum standards that governments must meet in providing healthcare, education and legal and social services to children in their countries.\n",
      "The Convention entered into force in September 1990. Ireland ratified the Convention in 1992.\n",
      "In 2002, two Optional Protocols to the Convention came into force:\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography\n",
      "Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict\n",
      "You can find a child-friendly leaflet on the Convention (pdf) on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs website.\n",
      "Committee on the Rights of the Child\n",
      "The Committee on the Rights of the Child is a United Nations (UN) body of 18 Independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by the countries that are party to it. It also monitors implementation of the two Optional Protocols.\n",
      "The countries are obliged to submit regular reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. They must submit an initial report two years after acceding to the Convention and then periodic reports every five years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the country in the form of concluding observations. Ireland submitted its most recent report in 2013.\n",
      "Third Optional Protocol\n",
      "An Optional Protocol on a communications procedure (pdf) came into effect in Ireland on 24 December 2014. The Protocol allows individual children, or those acting on their behalf, to submit complaints regarding specific violations of their rights under the Convention and its first two Optional Protocols directly to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n",
      "A decision by the Committee on a complaint is non-binding on a country. As a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Ireland is answerable to the United Nations for its implementation of the Convention.\n",
      "The rules of the procedure are available on the UN Human Rights website.\n",
      "You can find more information on the Protocol on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs website.\n",
      "Making a complaint\n",
      "A complaint may be submitted to the Committee by a child (or a group of children) claiming to be a victim of a violation of the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols. A complaint may also be submitted by their designated representative, or by others acting on behalf of the alleged victim with their consent. Where there is a concern that the victim’s consent may be the result of improper pressure or inducement, the Committee may request additional information to ensure that the complaint is in the best interests of the child.\n",
      "A complaint may be submitted on behalf of the alleged victim without their consent - in this case, the representative will have to justify submitting the complaint.\n",
      "The Committee will not accept a complaint if:\n",
      "It is anonymous\n",
      "It is not in writing\n",
      "It constitutes an abuse of the right of submission of such complaints or is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols\n",
      "The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement\n",
      "All available domestic remedies have not been exhausted unless the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to bring effective relief\n",
      "The complaint is manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated\n",
      "The facts that are the subject of the complaint occurred prior to the entry into force of the third Protocol for the country concerned, unless those facts continued after that date\n",

      "UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\n",
      "These principles are laid down in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was passed unanimously in November 1989 and entered into force in September 1990. It stands out among all human rights covenants as the one having obtained the highest number of ratifications. At present, all members of the United Nations have ratified the Convention - with the exception of the United States and Somalia. They have signed the Convention, but not yet ratified it. The main body for enforcing the convention is the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which monitors the implementation of the Convention by its State Parties.\n",
      "Optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child\n",
      "Two additional Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child were adopted by the General Assembly in 2000. They entered into force two years later and are intended to prevent involvement of children in armed conflict and the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 2011 another optional protocol on children and communications procedure was adopted:\n",

      "In 1990, the UN Commission on Human Rights appointed a Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography by resolution 1990/68, with the mandate of to investigate the exploitation of children around the world and to submit reports to the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, making recommendations for the protection of the rights of the children concerned. Today the special rapporteur is subjected to the Human Rights Council.\n",
      "In 1997 United Nations Secretary-General appointed the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict to monitor the situation of children in armed conflicts.\n",

The World Summit adopted the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and a Plan of Action for implementing the Declaration in the 1990s.\n",
      "In 2002 the Special Session of the UN General Assembly on Childrentook place. It was the first of its kind devoted exclusively to children and with children as official delegates. At this special session the nations of the world committed themselves to a series of goals to improve the situation of children and young people.\n",

      "The Norwegian government will not go along with a protocol that allows children to lodge complaints over violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and three other UN conventions.\n",
      "The government's decision goes against the advice of numerous Norwegian human rights groups and the demands of its partners in the Liberal Party (Venstre).\n",
      "  “The main reason why the government will not propose Norwegian adherence to the complaint ordinance now is that it is highly uncertain what political consequences the schemes might have for Norway,” Foreign Minister Børge Brende said. \n",
      "  Brende said that human rights are well protected in Norway and that a number of UN conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, have been incorporated into Norwegian law and given precedence over other legislation.\n",
      "  Contrary to advice\n",
      "The Liberals have long demanded that Norway adopt the Optional Protocol to the Convention that allows children to submit complaints, appeals and petitions. This week, the Norwegian National Human Rights Institution (NIM) also called on the government to do the same. \n",
      "  “We hope the government will propose the ratification of this and two other complaints procedures which Norway has recognized,” NIM director Petter F. Wille told NTB.\n",
      "  The government was originally asked by parliament to present the ratification for approval last year, but in December the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked to delay the legislation until the spring. But it has still not been presented to parliament. \n",
      "  The Optional Protocol has been ratified by 29 countries and signed by 50, including Denmark and Finland.\n",
      "  “Embarrassing”\n",
      "As far back as September 2014, it raised eyebrows when Norway rejected a recommendation from the UN Human Rights Council to ratify the protocol. \n",
      "  “This is embarrassing and not something Norway can be proud of,” Liberal leader Trine Skei Grande said.\n",
      "  UNICEF, Save the Children and Plan International Norway have all criticized the government for not joining the protocol, which would give Norwegian children the opportunity to complain about rights violations and bring the matter before the UN Children's Committee in Geneva.\n",
      "  The government says its resistance to go along with the Protocol is that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child would not properly balance considerations of what's best for a child against other important public interests, such as immigration regulations.\n",
      "  “Before we leave the interpretation of key policy issues to international bodies we must be sure that the treatment is proper,” Brende said.\n",
      "  The other two individual complaint mechanisms the Norwegian government is refusing to ratify are related to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n",
