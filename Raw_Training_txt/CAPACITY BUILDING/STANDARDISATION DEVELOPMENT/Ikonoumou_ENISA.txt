The challenge of ‘complexity’

Committee designs

Backwards compatibility

Optimizations for various cases

High complexity

• barrier for evaluation
• barrier for market entry
• makes secure implementation very difficult

8

The challenge of ‘maintenance’

Context changes;

New technical vulnerabilities;

Is fixing it better than doing nothing?

Fast changes incompatible with slow consensus-
based procedures;

9

Challenges (from an EU perspective)…

Lack of consistent strategy towards standards (cPPP, MSP?);

Need establishing a small number of key initiatives at EU level 
(‘Airbus’-like projects)
• Multi-disciplinary projects with industrial participation;
• Necessary contributions by DPAs, apps developers;
• H2020, cPPP, MSP;
Improve coordination between EU funded R&D and ISO;

Possible ‘vehicles’ for such a coordination

ETSI CEN CENELEC CSCG (???);
•
• H2020 (industrial platforms);,
•

cPPP and/or MSP;

10

10

Open questions…

Are current initiatives adequate to address the issues?

•

If not, what other is needed?

How to transpose the high level objectives (e.g. CSCG) into 
projects and to the market (regulatory initiatives)?

Industrial involvement??

• Research (e.g. H2020), regulation, etc.?
• Are standardisation mandates the best (or an appropriate tool)?

Is there a role for the public sector (e.g. procurement, 
certification, etc.)?

Example
Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 – eIDAS

• Articles 30 and 39: Obligation regarding the certification 

of the conformity of QSCDs that:
- Must be assessed with regard to the requirements set in Annex 

II

- Must be carried out by appropriate public or private bodies 

designated by Member States (art.30.1) that must be notified 
to the Commission (art.30.2)

- Must be carried out according to standards to be listed in the 

implementing act pursuant to article 30. 3; or

- An alternative process using comparable security levels may be 

used only in the absence of standards or when a security 
evaluation is on-going.

• Delegated acts concerning the establishment of criteria to 

•

be met by the designated bodies (art. 30.4)
Implementing acts in order to list standards for the 
security assessment of IT security products (art.30.3)

SOGIS-MRA
Technical framework for IT security certification

• SOGIS – Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) (v.3) – 2010

-
-

Signed by AT, FI, FR, DE, IT, NL, UK, ES, SE + NO
Participants to this Agreement are government organisations or 
government agencies 

- Recognition from all signatories of CC and ITSEC certificates up to EAL 4
- Recognition of highest assurance levels defined for specific IT technical 

-

domains (including smart card technologies).
Peer review and information sharing amongst participants -> 
recognition of certificates issued

• The MRA is not part of the “EU acquis”
• The MRA does not apply to the 28 Member States

Concluding Remarks

Not addressed all related issues 

Market position of EU ICT industries;

horizontal vs. vertical solutions on standardization.

Standards are a tool, not the objective;

Maintaining security standards is perhaps more complex than general 
standards;

Plethora of fora and initiatives

•

not enough coordination

Open evaluation procedures essential;

Stimulate European market through procurement might be an approach?

Need for an EU strategy on research & standardisation.

Regulation 526/2013, Art.3.1d 

Support research and development and standardisation, by: 

(i) facilitating the establishment and take-up of European and international 
standards for risk management and for the security of electronic products, 
networks and services; 
(ii) advising the Union and the Member States on research needs in the 
area of network and information security with a view to enabling effective 
responses to current and emerging network and information security risks 
and threats, including with respect to new and emerging information and 
communications technologies, and to using risk-prevention technologies 
effectively;

ENISA approach to standards

• Aim: promotion of best practices through SDOs
• ENISA role: interface between private sector, public sector, 

SDOs

• Short- and mid-term goals

Formal cooperation with SDOs and specific WGs

Art. 3 – In order to ensure that the scope and objectives set out in 
Articles 1 and 2 are complied with and met, the Agency shall perform 
the following tasks:

(g): to track the development of standards for products and services on 
network and information security

However

(12) The exercise of the Agency's tasks should not interfere with the 
competencies and should not pre-empt, impede or overlap with the relevant 
powers and tasks conferred on:
the European standardisation bodies, the national standardisation bodies and 
the Standing Committee as set out in Directive 98/34/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the 
provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and 
of rules on Information Society Services
