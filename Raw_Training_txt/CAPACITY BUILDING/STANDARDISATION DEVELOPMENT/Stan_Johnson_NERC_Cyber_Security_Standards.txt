Future Status
Future Status

(cid:131) Final Rule will (likely) contain directed changes to 

standards
•  Clarify Requirements / Remove ambiguity
•  Include “implied” requirements
•  Some controversial issues 

(cid:131) Final Rule cannot change the standards language

•  Changes must go through Standards Development 

Process

•  Changes will therefore have their own implementation 

plan and schedule

(cid:131) Bulk Electric System:

•  As defined by the Regional Reliability Organization, the 

electrical generation resources, transmission lines, 
interconnections with neighboring systems, and 
associated equipment, generally operated at voltages 
of 100 kV or higher. Radial transmission facilities 
serving only load with one transmission source are 
generally not included in this definition.

(cid:131) Adverse Reliability Impact:

•  The impact of an event that results in frequency-related 
instability; unplanned tripping of load or generation; or 
uncontrolled separation or cascading outages that 
affects a widespread area of the Interconnection.

(cid:131) Technical Feasibility:

•  refers only to engineering possibility and is expected to be a 
“can/cannot” determination in every circumstance. It is also 
intended to be determined in light of the equipment and 
facilities already owned by the Responsible Entity. The 
Responsible Entity is not required to replace any equipment 
in order to achieve compliance with the Cyber Security 
Standards. When existing equipment is replaced, however, 
the Responsible Entity is expected to use reasonable 
business judgment to evaluate the need to upgrade the 
equipment so that the new equipment can perform a 
particular specified technical function in order to meet the 
requirements of these standards.

(cid:131) Reasonable Business Judgment:

•  The phrase is in NERC Standards CIP-002 through 

CIP-009 to reflect — and to inform — any 
regulatory body or ultimate judicial arbiter of 
disputes regarding interpretation of these 
Standards — that Responsible Entities have a 
significant degree of flexibility in implementing 
these Standards.

•  This principle, however, does not protect an entity 

from simply failing to make a decision.

(cid:131) Significant Adverse Impact:

•  With due regard for the maximum operating capability of the affected 

system, one or more of the following conditions arising from faults 
or disturbances, shall be deemed as having significant adverse 
impact:

(cid:131) System instability;
(cid:131) Unacceptable system dynamic response or equipment tripping’
(cid:131) Voltage limits in violation of applicable emergency limits;
