NIST Industrial Control System (ICS) Cyber 
Security Project

■ Objective: to improve the cyber security of federally owned/operated 

ICS

■ ICS pervasive throughout all critical infrastructures
■ Improve the security of public and private sector ICS

– Work with voluntary industry standards groups (e.g., The 
Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society – ISA)

oAssist in ICS cyber security standards and guideline 

development

oFoster ICS cyber security standards convergence

– Raise the level of ICS security through R&D and testing

■ Purpose of case studies is to focus in on factors otherwise 

overlooked, not to ascribe any blame

NIST Cyber Security Strategic Vision

■ Promote the development of key security standards and 

guidelines to support the implementation of and compliance 
with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

■ Build a solid foundation of information security across one of 
the largest information technology infrastructures in the world 
based on comprehensive security standards and technical 
guidance.

■ Institutionalize a comprehensive Risk Management Framework 

that promotes flexible, cost-effective information security 
programs for federal agencies.

■ Establish a fundamental level of ―security due diligence‖ for 

federal agencies and their contractors based on minimum 
security requirements and security controls.

■ NIST standards and guidelines are voluntarily used by the 

private sector

The Current Landscape









Public and private sector enterprises today are highly 
dependent on information systems to carry out their 
missions and business functions.

Developments in ICS have seen these traditionally closed 
systems become open and internet-connected, thus 
putting the national services critical infrastructure at risk.  

To achieve mission and business success, enterprise 
information systems must be dependable in the face of 
serious cyber threats.

To achieve information system dependability, the systems 
must be appropriately protected.

The Threat Situation

■ ICS are becoming more open making them vulnerable to 

intentional and unintentional cyber threats

■ Effects of errors and omissions increasingly catastrophic
■ Attacks are organized, disciplined, aggressive, and well 

resourced; many are extremely sophisticated

■ Adversaries are nation states, terrorist groups, criminals, 

hackers, and individuals or groups with intentions of 
compromising information systems

■ Significant exfiltration of critical and sensitive information 

and implantation of malicious software occurring on a 
regular basis 

■ Largely untutored work force with little interest in IT security
■ ICS community diverse using different protocols (many 

archaic)

NIST ICS Project Deliverables

■ Support public & private sectors, and standards organizations 

that want to use NIST Standards & Guidelines for ICS

■ Evolve SP 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal 

Information Systems to better address ICS
– Revision 2 published December 2007

■ Develop SP 800-82 Guide to Supervisory Control and Data 

Acquisition (SCADA) and Industrial Control System Security
– Second draft September 2007
– Final in 2008

Case Study Overview

■ Examine actual control system cyber event

– Resulted in significant environmental and economic damage
– Malicious attack by knowledgeable insider, who had been a 

trusted contractor employee

– Timelines, control system response, and control system 

policies 

■ Identify operating policies and procedures that were missing or 

had readily identifiable cyber security vulnerabilities 

■ Identify NIST SP 800-53 management, operational, and technical 
safeguards or countermeasures that, if implemented, could have 
prevented or ameliorated the event

Attack Synopsis

■ Vitek Boden worked for Hunter Watertech, an Australian 

firm that installed SCADA radio-controlled sewage 
equipment for the Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, 
Australia (a rural area of great natural beauty and a tourist 
destination )
– Applied for a job with the Maroochy Shire Council

– Walked away from a ―strained relationship‖ with Hunter 

Watertech

– The Council decided not to hire him

– Boden decided to get even with both the Council and his 

former employer

■ On at least 46 occasions issued radio commands to the 

sewage equipment 
– Caused 800,000 liters of raw sewage to spill out into local 

parks, rivers and even the grounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel  

– Marine life died, the creek water turned black and the stench 

was unbearable for residents

Time Line

■ 1997-December 1999 – Boden employed by Hunter Watertech
■ December 3, 1999 – Boden resigns from Hunter Watertech
■ Early December 1999 – Boden seeks City Council employment
■ Early January 2000 – Boden turned down
■ February 9-April 23, 2000 – SCADA system experiences series of 

faults

■ March 16, 2000 – Hunter Watertech investigator tried to 

troubleshoot system

■ April 19, 2000 – Log indicates system program had been run at 

least 31 times 

■ April 23, 2000 – Boden disabled alarms at four pumping stations 

using the identification of pumping station 4. 

■ April 23, 2000 – Boden pulled over by police with computer 

equipment in car

■ October 31, 2001 – Boden convicted in trial – sentenced to 2 years
■ March 21, 2002 – Appeal rejected

Evidence Found in Boden’s Vehicle 

■ Laptop

– Reloaded February 28, 2000

– Software used in the sewerage system (re)installed February 29  

o Run at least 31 times prior to April 19
o Last run on April 23

■ Motorola M120 two-way radio same type used in the Council’s 

system
– Tuned into the frequencies of the repeater stations

– Serial numbers matched delivery docket provided by the supplier 

of the radios to Hunter Watertech

■ PDS Compact 500 computer control device

– Address set to spoof pumping station

– Serial number identified it as a device which should have been in 

the possession of Hunter Watertech

Observations (1/2)

■ Boden was an insider who was never an employee of the 

organization he attacked
– Employee of contractor that supplied IT/control system technology

– With his knowledge he was the ―ultimate insider‖

■ Contractor’s responsibilities unstated or inadequate 

– Management, technical and operational cyber security controls

– Personnel security controls 

o Background investigations
o Protection from disgruntled employees

■ As a skillful adversary, Boden was able to disguise his actions

– A number of anomalous events occurred before recognition that the 

incidents were intentional

– Extensive digital forensics were required to determine that a 

deliberate attack was underway 

■ No existing cyber security policies or procedures
■ No cyber security defenses

11

Observations (2/2)

■ Difficult to differentiate attacks from malfunctions 
■ When/why is it important to determine whether intentional 

attack, or unintentional flaw or error?

■ Difficult to protect against insider attacks
■ Radio communications commonly used in SCADA systems are 

often insecure or improperly configured

■ SCADA devices and software should be secured to the extent 

possible using physical and logical controls

■ Security controls often not implemented or used properly
■ Generally SCADA systems lack adequate logging mechanisms 

for forensic purposes

■ Also recommended 

• Anti-virus

 Firewall protection    Appropriate use of encryption

• Upgrade-able SCADA systems (from a security perspective)

• Proper staff training

 Security auditing and control.

reviews/updates: 

o a formal, documented, <family> policy that addresses 

purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management 
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, 
and compliance

oformal, documented procedures to facilitate the

Learning From the 2000 Maroochy Shire 
Cyber Attack

■ Public record of an intentional, targeted attack by a 

knowledgeable person on an industrial control system teaches 
us to consider:
– Critical physical, administrative, and supply chain vulnerabilities

– Vulnerabilities coming from suppliers or others outside the 

organization

– Contractor and sub-contractor personnel as a potential attack 

source

■ Need to be concerned with both inside & outside attack
■ Difficulty in identifying a control system cyber incident as a 
malicious attack and retaking control of a ―hijacked‖ system 

■ A determined, knowledgeable adversary could potentially 

defeat most controls

■ Structured defense-in-depth security is best
