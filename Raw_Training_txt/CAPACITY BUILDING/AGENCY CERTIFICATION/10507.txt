Implementation Strategy and Approach

 The assessment

report produced by NTT Data described the agency’s current

cybersecurity posture.



The recommendations provided by the vendor laid out a “Target State” vision for our
cybersecurity infrastructure.

 Our implementation strategy was established by focusing on the five key functions in

cybersecurity risks management as outlined in the TX Cybersecurity Framework:

 Identify
 Protect
 Detect
 Respond
 Recover

 We assess progress toward the “Target State” on a quarterly basis and make adjustments

when necessary.
