Abstract 

This publication describes the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) 
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE Framework), a reference structure that describes 
the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity work. It serves as a fundamental reference 
resource for describing and sharing information about cybersecurity work and the knowledge, 
skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to complete tasks that can strengthen the cybersecurity 
posture of an organization. As a common, consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes 
cybersecurity work, the NICE Framework improves communication about how to identify, 
recruit, develop, and retain cybersecurity talent. The NICE Framework is a reference source from 
which organizations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet their needs 
to define or provide guidance on different aspects of cybersecurity workforce development, 
planning, training, and education.

Executive Summary 

NICE FRAMEWORK 

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is a partnership 
between government, academia, and the private sector working to energize and promote a robust 
network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce 
development. NICE fulfills this mission by coordinating with government, academic, and 
industry partners to build on existing successful programs, facilitate change and innovation, and 
bring leadership and vision to increase the number of skilled cybersecurity professionals helping 
to keep our nation secure. 

NICE is committed to cultivating an integrated cybersecurity workforce that is globally 
competitive from hire to retire and prepared to protect our nation from existing and emerging 
cybersecurity challenges. NICE promotes nationwide initiatives that increase the number of 
people with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the tasks required for cybersecurity 
work.  

As threats that exploit vulnerabilities in our cyberinfrastructure grow and evolve, an integrated 
cybersecurity workforce must be capable of designing, developing, implementing, and 
maintaining defensive and offensive cyber strategies. An integrated cybersecurity workforce 
includes technical and nontechnical roles that are staffed with knowledgeable and experienced 
people.  An integrated cybersecurity workforce can address the cybersecurity challenges inherent 
to preparing their organizations to successfully implement aspects of their missions and business 
processes connected to cyberspace. 

This publication provides a fundamental reference in support of a workforce capable of meeting 
an organization’s cybersecurity needs by using a common, consistent lexicon to describe 
cybersecurity work by category, specialty area, and work role. It provides a superset of 
cybersecurity Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) and Tasks for each work role. The NICE 
Framework supports consistent organizational and sector communication for cybersecurity 
education, training, and workforce development. 

A user of the NICE Framework will reference it for different aspects of workforce development, 
education, and/or training purposes, and when that material is used at organizational levels, the 
user should customize what is pulled from the NICE Framework to standards, regulations, needs, 
and mission of the user’s organization. The NICE Framework is a reference starting point for the 
content of guidance and guidelines on career paths, education, training, and credentialing 
programs.  
The NICE Framework is a resource that will strengthen an organization’s ability to communicate 
consistently and clearly about cybersecurity work and its cybersecurity workforce. Organizations 
or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet their needs to define or provide 
guidance on different aspects of workforce development, planning, training, and education.  

An online reference spreadsheet tool [4] is available on the NICE Framework website [5].

Introduction 

NICE FRAMEWORK 

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S. Department of Commerce, is a partnership 
between government, academia, and the private sector that seeks to energize and promote a 
robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce 
development. NICE fulfills this mission by coordinating with government, academic, and 
industry partners to build on existing successful programs, facilitate change and innovation, and 
bring leadership and vision to increase the number of skilled cybersecurity professionals helping 
to keep our nation secure and economically competitive. 

NICE is committed to cultivating an integrated cybersecurity workforce that is globally 
competitive from hire to retire, prepared to protect our nation from existing and emerging 
cybersecurity challenges.  

Throughout this document, the combined terms “cybersecurity workforce” is shorthand for a 
workforce with work roles that have an impact on an organization’s ability to protect its data, 
systems, and operations. Included are new work roles that have been known traditionally as 
information technology (IT) security roles. Those roles have been added to this workforce 
framework to highlight their importance to the overall cybersecurity posture of an organization.  
Additionally, some of the work roles described herein include the shorter term cyber to be 
inclusive of sectors where cyber has become the conversational norm for this field.  

A cybersecurity workforce includes not only technically focused staff, but also those who apply 
knowledge of cybersecurity when preparing their organization to successfully implement its 
mission. A knowledgeable and skilled cybersecurity workforce is needed to address 
cybersecurity risks within an organization’s overall risk management process. 

1.1  NICE Framework Background 

The concept for the NICE Framework began before the establishment of NICE in 2010 and grew 
out of the recognition that the cybersecurity workforce had not been defined and assessed. To 
address this challenge, the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council took on the task in 
2008 to provide a standard framework to understand the cybersecurity roles within the federal 
government.  Input from focus groups with subject matter experts from numerous federal 
agencies helped the Federal CIO Council produce a research report that referenced where other 
information technology professional development efforts were already under way, and thirteen 
specific roles were identified as needed by agencies to conduct cybersecurity work.  

Building on this inherently multidisciplinary exploration of the “field” of cybersecurity, the 
Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative’s included a focus on workforce that tasked 
several agencies to work together to develop a cybersecurity workforce framework.  The first 
draft was posted for public comment in September 2011. Comments were incorporated into 
version 1.0 [2].  

A subsequent U.S. government-wide review noted specific areas to be further examined and 
refined. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gathered input and validated final

NICE FRAMEWORK 

recommendations via focus groups with subject matter experts from around the country and 
across industry, academia, and government resulting in a second version of the NICE 
Framework, version 2.0 [3], shared publicly in 2014. 

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) expanded on version 2.0 through internal 
engagements with service components and external engagements with the private sector. The 
DHS and NIST co-authors worked with OSD to refine their expansion to become this publication 
with a goal to emphasize private sector applicability and to reinforce the vision that the NICE 
Framework is a reference resource for both the public and private sectors. 

1.2  Purpose and Applicability 

This publication serves as a fundamental reference resource to support a workforce capable of 
meeting an organization’s cybersecurity needs. It provides organizations with a common, 
consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work. 

Using the NICE Framework as a fundamental reference will improve the communication needed 
to identify, recruit, and develop cybersecurity talent. The NICE Framework will allow employers 
to use focused, consistent language in professional development programs, in their use of 
industry certifications and academic credentials, and in their selection of relevant training 
opportunities for their workforce. 

The NICE Framework facilitates the use of a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable 
approach to select and specify cybersecurity roles for positions within organizations. It also 
provides a common lexicon that academic institutions can use to develop cybersecurity curricula 
that better prepares students for current and anticipated cybersecurity workforce needs.  

The application of the NICE Framework offers the ability to describe all cybersecurity work. An 
applicability goal of the NICE Framework is that any cybersecurity job or position can be 
described by identifying the relevant material from one or more components of the NICE 
Framework. For each job or position, the context of the mission or business processes and 
priorities will drive which material is selected from the NICE Framework.  

Organizations or sectors can use the NICE Framework to develop additional publications or tools 
that meet their needs to define or provide guidance on different aspects of workforce 
development, planning, training, and education. 

1.3  Audience/Users 

The NICE Framework can be viewed as a non-prescriptive cybersecurity workforce dictionary. 
Users of the NICE Framework who reference it should implement it locally for different 
workforce development, education, or training purposes.  

1.3.1  Employers 

Use of the NICE Framework’s common lexicon enables employers to inventory and develop 
their cybersecurity workforce. The NICE Framework can be used by employers and 
organizational leadership to:

NICE FRAMEWORK 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Inventory and track their cybersecurity workforce to gain a greater understanding of the 
strengths and gaps in Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities and Tasks performed; 
Identify training and qualification requirements to develop critical Knowledge, Skills, 
and Abilities to perform cybersecurity Tasks; 
Improve position descriptions and job vacancy announcements selecting relevant KSAs 
and Tasks, once work roles and tasks are identified; 
Identify the most relevant work roles and develop career paths to guide staff in gaining 
the requisite skills for those roles; and 

•  Establish a shared terminology between hiring managers and human resources (HR) staff 

for the recruiting, retention, and training of a highly-specialized workforce. 
 

1.3.2  Current and Future Cybersecurity Workers 

The NICE Framework supports those in the cybersecurity field and those who might wish to 
enter the cybersecurity field, to explore Tasks within cybersecurity Categories and work roles. It 
also assists those who support these workers, such as human resource staffing specialists and 
guidance counselors, to help job seekers and students understand which cybersecurity work roles 
and which associated Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities are being valued by employers for in-
demand cybersecurity jobs and positions. 

These workers are further supported when vacancy announcements and open position 
descriptions use the NICE Framework’s common lexicon to provide clear and consistent 
descriptions of the cybersecurity tasks and training that are needed for those positions. 

When training providers and industry certification providers use the common lexicon of the 
NICE Framework, those in the cybersecurity field, or those who might wish to enter the 
cybersecurity field, can find training and/or certification providers that can teach the tasks 
necessary to secure a cybersecurity job or to progress into new positions. Use of the common 
lexicon helps students and professionals to obtain KSAs that are typically demonstrated by a 
person whose cybersecurity position includes a given work role. This understanding helps them 
to find academic programs that include learning outcomes and knowledge units that map to the 
KSAs and Tasks that are valued by employers. 

1.3.3  Educators/Trainers 

The NICE Framework provides a reference for educators to develop curriculum, certificate or 
degree programs, training programs, courses, seminars, and exercises or challenges that cover the 
KSAs and Tasks described in the NICE Framework. 

Human resource staffing specialists and guidance counselors can use the NICE Framework as a 
resource for career exploration.

1.3.4  Technology Providers 

NICE FRAMEWORK 

The NICE Framework allows a technology provider to identify the cybersecurity work roles and 
the KSAs and Tasks associated with hardware and software products and services they provide.  
A technology provider can then create appropriate support materials to assist members of the 
cybersecurity workforce in the proper configuration and management of their products.

NICE Framework Components and Relationships 

2.1  Components of the NICE Framework 

The NICE Framework organizes cybersecurity and related work. This section introduces and 
defines the core components of the NICE Framework in support of those areas.  

2.1.1  Categories 

Categories provide the overarching organizational structure of the NICE Framework. There are 
seven Categories and all are composed of Specialty Areas and work roles. This organizational 
structure is based on extensive job analyses, which group together work and workers that share 
common major functions, regardless of job titles or other occupational terms.

2.1.2  Specialty Areas 

Categories contain groupings of cybersecurity work, which are called Specialty Areas. There 
were 31 specialty areas called out in National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework version 1.0 
[2] and 32 in National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework version 2.0 [3]. Each specialty area 
represents an area of concentrated work, or function, within cybersecurity and related work. In 
previous versions of the NICE Framework, tasks and KSAs were associated with each specialty 
area. KSAs and Tasks are now associated with the work roles. 

2.1.3  Work Roles 

Work roles are the most detailed groupings of cybersecurity and related work which include a 
list of attributes required to perform that role in the form of knowledge, skills, and abilities 
(KSAs) and tasks performed in that role. 

Work being performed in a job or position is described by selecting one or more work roles from 
the NICE Framework relevant to that job or position, in support of mission or business 
processes. 

To aid in the organization and communication about cybersecurity responsibilities, work roles 
are grouped into specific classes of categories and specialty areas as shown in Appendix A. 

2.1.4  Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) 

Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) are the attributes required to perform work roles and are 
generally demonstrated through relevant experience, education, or training. 

Knowledge is a body of information applied directly to the performance of a function.  
Skill is often defined as an observable competence to perform a learned psychomotor act. 
Skills in the psychomotor domain describe the ability to physically manipulate a tool or 
instrument like a hand or a hammer. Skills needed for cybersecurity rely less on physical 
manipulation of tools and instruments and more on applying tools, frameworks, processes, 

5 

NIST SP 800-181 
  

NICE FRAMEWORK 

and controls that have an impact on the cybersecurity posture of an organization or 
individual. 
Ability is competence to perform an observable behavior or a behavior that results in an 
observable product.  
 

2.1.5  Tasks 

A Task is a specific defined piece of work that, combined with other identified Tasks, composes 
the work in a specific specialty area or work role.

The NICE Framework components describe cybersecurity work. As illustrated in Figure 1, each 
Category is composed of Specialty Areas, each of which is composed of one or more work roles. 
Each work role, in turn, includes KSAs and Tasks.  

Grouping components in this manner simplifies communication about cybersecurity workforce 
topics, and helps with alignment to other frameworks. Specific associations of work roles to 
KSAs and Tasks are shown in Appendix B and in a reference spreadsheet [4] posted to the NICE 
Framework website [5].

Using the NICE Framework 

NICE FRAMEWORK 

Using the NICE Framework to understand organizational needs and assess the extent to which 
those needs are met can help an organization to plan, implement, and monitor a successful 
cybersecurity program.   

3.1 

Identification of Cybersecurity Workforce Needs 

Cybersecurity is a rapidly changing and expanding field. This expansion requires a cadre of 
skilled workers to help organizations perform cybersecurity functions. As organizations identify 
what is needed to adequately manage current and future cybersecurity risk, leaders need to 
consider the cybersecurity workforce capabilities and capacity needed.  

Figure 2 illustrates how the NICE Framework is a central reference to help employers build a 
capable and ready cybersecurity workforce. 

 

Figure 2 - Building Blocks for a Capable and Ready Cybersecurity Workforce 

The circular arrows on the left side of Figure 2 are activities that are likely to have an impact on 
an organization’s ability to develop a capable and ready workforce: 

•  Using the common lexicon of the NICE Framework clarifies communication between 

cybersecurity educators, trainers/certifiers, employers, and employees. 

•  Performing criticality analysis will identify those KSAs and tasks that are critical for 

successful performance with a given work role and those that are key to multiple work 
roles.  

•  Running a proficiency analysis will inform an organization’s expectation of the level (e.g. 

entry-level, expert) for positions, comprised often of more than one work role.  The 
proficiency analysis should enable refinement of selection of the relevant tasks, and 
KSAs needed for the work roles that make up that position.

NIST SP 800-181 
  

NICE FRAMEWORK 

Appendix C identifies some existing workforce development tools that support identification of 
cybersecurity workforce needs. 

3.2  Recruitment and Hiring of Highly Skilled Cybersecurity Talent  

Referencing the NICE Framework will help organizations to accomplish strategic workforce 
planning and hiring. NICE Framework material, when used during the creation or revision of 
position descriptions in vacancy announcements and job postings, will help candidates to seek 
out specific positions for which they are interested, capable, or qualified. Tasks used to describe 
a position’s duties and responsibilities, and KSAs used to describe the position’s needed skills 
and qualifications, should allow candidates and hiring managers to communicate more 
effectively. Position descriptions and vacancy announcements using the NICE Framework 
terminology support more consistent evaluation criteria for vetting and approving candidates.

For organizations who are concerned with workforce gaps, a review of the NICE Framework’s 
list of tasks can determine specific tasks which are not being performed by the organization.  
Those tasks allow the organization to identify the work role(s) and specialty area(s) that are gaps. 
The organization is better able to engage with the community of education, training, and 
credential, and certification providers who map their offerings to the NICE Framework. The 
organization can identify training that will allow existing staff member to address the gaps.  The 
organization’s hiring managers using data pulled from the NICE Framework in this manner can 
recognize applicants who have the KSAs to perform the cybersecurity tasks. 

3.3  Education and Training of Cybersecurity Workforce Members  

The NICE Framework’ identification of tasks in work roles allows educators to prepare learners 
with the specific KSAs from which they can demonstrate the ability to perform cybersecurity 
tasks. 

Academic institutions are a critical part of preparing and educating the cybersecurity workforce. 
Collaboration among public and private entities, such as through the NICE program, enables 
such institutions to determine common knowledge and abilities that are needed. In turn, 
developing and delivering curricula that are harmonized with the NICE Framework lexicon 
allows institutions to prepare students with the skills needed by employers. As the pipeline of 
students finding desired jobs in cybersecurity increases, more students will be attracted to 
academic cybersecurity programs as a pathway to a career.   

3.4  Retention and Development of Highly Skilled Cybersecurity Talent 

A critical aspect of a skilled cybersecurity workforce involves the development and retention of 
the skilled talent already onboard. A current employee has existing relationships, institutional 
knowledge, and organizational experience that is hard to replace. Refilling a position after an 
employee leaves may bring new advertising and hiring costs, expenses for training, diminished 
productivity, and reduced morale. The following list illustrates some of the ways that the NICE 
Framework supports retention and development of cybersecurity talent:

NICE FRAMEWORK 

•  Organizations can develop career pathways that describe the qualifications necessary for 
progressively challenging and evolving sets of work roles, such as those enumerated by 
the NICE Framework. 

•  A detailed understanding of the KSAs and Tasks helps existing staff to understand the 

specific steps needed to develop their capabilities, promoting readiness for a desired 
position.  

•  An organization might offer staff rotations to provide opportunities to develop and use 

new skills. 

•  Organizations can identify personnel that are diligent in improving KSAs in relevant 

areas, recognizing those who perform well. 

•  Organizations can create development/improvement plans for staff to help them map out 

how they can obtain KSAs required for new work roles.  

•  Group training opportunities can be identified to prepare staff members to enhance 

common knowledge, skills, and abilities in the work roles of an organization.  

•  Organizations can use training and examinations that are based for specific cybersecurity 

skills and abilities to assess proficiency in a realistic environment.  

•  Organizations can use existing personnel to fill critical cybersecurity staffing needs, 

leveraging the ability to review resumes of existing staff to identify those with desirable 
KSAs. 

•  The NICE Framework is helpful for existing employees who desire to move into a 

cybersecurity work role from another position. An organization can describe the KSAs 
needed to allow a reliable employee in a non-cybersecurity work role to become part of 
the cybersecurity workforce taking on cybersecurity tasks.

NICE FRAMEWORK 

Organizations or sectors can use the NICE Framework to develop additional publications or tools 
that meet their needs and define or provide guidance on different aspects of workforce 
development, planning, training, and education.  

New reference materials that cross-reference elements of the NICE Framework will be shared 
via the NICE website [5]. 

The following areas are a few examples from which additional publications or tools could be 
developed. 

4.1  Competencies  

The Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration [6] defines a competency 
as the capability of applying or using knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and personal 
characteristics to successfully perform critical work tasks, specific functions, or operate in a 
given role or position. In addition to the enumeration of technical KSAs, competency models 
also consider behavioral indicators and describe nontechnical considerations such as Personal 
Effectiveness, Academic, and Workplace Competencies. Additional information about these 
considerations is available from the Department of Labor’s CareerOneStop Site [7].   

4.2  Job Titles 

Job titles are a description of an employee’s job or position in an organization. A mapping of 
sample job titles to specialty areas or work roles would help organizations to use the NICE 
Framework.  

4.3  Cybersecurity Guidance and Guideline documents 

NICE Strategic Goal #3, Guide Career Development and Workforce Planning, aims to support 
employers to address market demands and enhance recruitment, hiring, development, and 
retention of cybersecurity talent. One objective within this strategic goal is to publish and raise 
awareness of the NICE Framework and encourage adoption. Adoption in this case means that the 
NICE Framework is used as a reference resource for actions related to cybersecurity workforce, 
training, and education. 

One way to encourage adoption of the NICE Framework is to encourage authors of cybersecurity 
guidance or guideline documents to cross reference their content with components of the NICE

NICE FRAMEWORK 

Appendix C – Workforce Development Tools  

C.1 

DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Development Toolkit 

The DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Development Toolkit (CWDT) [8] helps any organization 
understand its cybersecurity workforce and staffing needs to protect its information, customers, 
and networks. This toolkit includes cybersecurity career path templates and recruitment 
resources to recruit and retain top cybersecurity talent. The CWDT provides tools to help 
understand an organization’s cybersecurity workforce risks and take inventory of an 
organization’s workforce. CWDT tools leverage the specialty areas and KSAs and Tasks in the 
NICE Framework. CWDT notes that the first step in preparing to build a cybersecurity 
workforce is a shared vision for organizing one’s cybersecurity workforce. Having a shared 
vision supports leaders as they respond to changing environments and provides data to better 
adjust resources, see patterns of work, and highlight areas of potential risk. This understanding is 
especially important in the ever-changing environment of cybersecurity. The CWDT includes a 
Cybersecurity Workforce Planning Capability Maturity Model (CMM), a self-assessment tool to 
help an organization to evaluate the maturity of its cybersecurity workforce planning capability. 

The (CWDT) offers profiles as a guide to focus on retaining staff at every level whether entry-
level, mid-career, or seasoned cybersecurity professionals. 

C.1.1 

Proficiency Levels and Career Paths 

Developing and sharing career paths with employees will help them identify their proficiency 
levels and advance in cybersecurity career paths.  

The CWDT includes a three-step process to develop cybersecurity career paths for one’s 
organization.  

•  Step 1 – Familiarize yourself with proficiency levels and review sample career paths.  
•  Step 2 – Use a CWDT template to create custom cybersecurity-specific career paths for 
your organization filling in “Suggested Experience & Credentials,” “Competencies and 
Sample Skills / KSAs,” and “Suggested Training & Development Activities.” 

•  Step 3 – Share career paths with cybersecurity managers and staff.  

C.2 

Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder Tool 

Once an organization has determined its cybersecurity requirements (such as through a 
cybersecurity audit or an internal self-assessment), it can reference the NICE Framework to 
identify the work roles and tasks that will help fulfill those requirements. While general terms, 
such as “cyber professionals,” have historically been used to measure needs, the specificity 
provided by the NICE Framework provides a better approach to describe the dozens of discrete 
job functions needed. By identifying the required and available competencies, and by identifying 
gaps between required and available skills, the organization can identify critical needs. The 
NICE Framework helps an organization to answer the following questions, drawn from the 
Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder Tool [9], regarding maintenance of an effective and 
supportive workforce environment to achieve its cybersecurity goals:

As more organizations assess their cybersecurity workforce, the common lexicon in the NICE 
Framework enables capacity and capability assessment across multiple organizations, industry 
sectors, and regions. 

C.3 

Position Description Drafting Tool 

The DHS Cyberskills Management Support Initiative PushbuttonPD Tool [10] allows managers, 
supervisors, and HR specialists to rapidly draft a federal employee position description (PD) 
without the need for extensive training or prior knowledge of position classification. It is 
designed to present language from multiple, mission-critical authoritative sources and standards 
for duties, tasks, and KSAs, rapidly capture the hiring official’s requirements, and present them 
in a robust hiring package that can be easily integrated into existing agency HR processes. Any 
organization can experiment with the PushbuttonPD Tool to see how it pulls NICE Framework 
material into a job description.

NICE FRAMEWORK 

Appendix D – Cross Reference to Guidance and Guideline Documents 

NICE Strategic Goal #3 Guide Career Development and Workforce Planning aims to support 
employers to address market demands and enhance recruitment, hiring, development, and 
retention of cybersecurity talent. One objective within this strategic goal is to publish and raise 
awareness of the NICE Framework and encourage adoption. Adoption in this case means that the 
NICE Framework is used as a reference resource for actions related to cybersecurity workforce, 
training, and education. 

One way to encourage adoption of the NICE Framework is to push authors of cybersecurity 
guidance or guideline documents to cross reference some of the content of those documents to 
components in the NICE Framework. Appendix D includes examples of publication cross 
referencing that could encourage adoption of the NICE Framework.

Cybersecurity Framework  

In 2014, NIST released the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity [11], 
commonly referred to as the Cybersecurity Framework. Developed in response to Executive 
Order (EO) 13636 [12], the Cybersecurity Framework provides a performance-based and cost-
effective approach to help organizations to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risk. It was 
built through a series of public workshops that were convened by NIST to better understand what 
standards and methodologies are helpful for achieving effective risk management, and how 
voluntary existing good practices might be implemented to improve cybersecurity. 

A companion document to the Cybersecurity Framework, the NIST Roadmap for Improving 
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity [13] points to the need for a skilled cybersecurity 
workforce to meet the unique cybersecurity needs of critical infrastructure. It recognizes that, as 
the cybersecurity threat and technology environments evolve, the workforce must continue to 
adapt to design, develop, implement, maintain, and continuously improve the necessary 
cybersecurity practices. 

The Cybersecurity Framework consists of three parts: Framework Core, Framework 
Implementation Tiers, and Framework Profiles. Each Cybersecurity Framework component 
reinforces the connection between business drivers and cybersecurity activities. The Framework 
Core elements work together as follows: 

•  Functions organize basic cybersecurity activities at their highest level. These Functions - 

Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover - are described in detail below. 

•  Categories are the subdivisions of a Function into groups of cybersecurity outcomes 

closely tied to programmatic needs and activities. 

•  Subcategories further divide a Category into specific outcomes of technical and/or 

management activities. They provide a set of results that, while not exhaustive, helps to 
support achievement of the outcomes in each Category.  

•  Informative References are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices 
common among critical infrastructure sectors that illustrate a method to achieve the

outcomes associated with each Subcategory. The Informative References presented in the 
Framework Core are illustrative and not exhaustive. They represent the cross-sector 
guidance most frequently referenced during the Framework development process. 

The Core Functions each contribute to a high-level understanding of the cybersecurity needs of 
the organization: 

•  Identify (ID) – Develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to 

systems, assets, data, and capabilities.  

•  Protect (PR) – Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of 

critical infrastructure services.  

•  Detect (DE) – Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the 

occurrence of a cybersecurity event.  

•  Respond (RS) – Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action 

regarding a detected cybersecurity event.  

•  Recover (RC) – Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for 

resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a 
cybersecurity event.  

In many ways, these Functions correlate to the NICE Framework Categories. Table 8 describes 
the relationships among the Cybersecurity Framework Functions and NICE Framework 
Categories.

Example Integration of Cybersecurity Framework with NICE Framework 

While the Cybersecurity Framework and the NICE Framework were developed separately, each 
complements the other by describing a hierarchical approach to achieving cybersecurity goals. 
Consider the following example: 

Cybersecurity Framework’s Respond Function includes a Mitigation (RS.MI) Category. The 
Category includes a Subcategory, RS.MI-2, pointing to an outcome of, “Incidents are 
mitigated.” While Cybersecurity Framework describes this outcome, and provides several 
informative references regarding the security controls to achieve it, Cybersecurity Framework 
does not provide any informative guidance regarding who should be responsible for attaining the 
outcome, or what KSAs would apply.

NICE FRAMEWORK 

Reviewing the NICE Framework, we identify the Cybersecurity Defense Incident Responder 
(PR-IR-001) role in the Protect and Defend (PR) category, Incident Response (IR) specialty 
area. We can review the description of this role to ensure that it aligns with the Cybersecurity 
Framework RS.MI-2 outcome: 

Responds  to  disruptions  within  the  pertinent  domain  to  mitigate  immediate  and 
potential threats. Uses mitigation, preparedness, and response and recovery approaches 
to  maximize  survival  of  life,  preservation  of  property,  and  information  security. 
Investigates and analyzes relevant response activities and evaluates the effectiveness 
of and improvements to existing practices. 

Investigates,  analyzes,  and  responds  to  cybersecurity  incidents  within  the  network 
environment or enclave. 

We learn from Appendix A of this document that the person whose position includes this work 
role might be expected to perform many of the following Tasks, which align with the desired 
Cybersecurity Framework outcome: 

•  T0041 - Coordinate and provide expert technical support to enterprise-wide cybersecurity 

defense technicians to resolve cybersecurity defense incidents. 

•  T0047 - Correlate incident data to identify specific vulnerabilities and make 

recommendations that enable expeditious remediation. 

•  T0161 - Perform analysis of log files from a variety of sources (e.g., individual host logs, 
network traffic logs, firewall logs, and intrusion detection system [IDS] logs) to identify 
possible threats to network security. 

•  T0163 - Perform cybersecurity defense incident triage, to include determining scope, 

urgency, and potential impact; identify the specific vulnerability; and make 
recommendations that enable expeditious remediation. 

•  T0170 - Perform initial, forensically sound collection of images and inspect to discern 

possible mitigation/remediation on enterprise systems. 

•  T0175 - Perform real-time cybersecurity defense incident handling (e.g., forensic 
collections, intrusion correlation and tracking, threat analysis, and direct system 
remediation) tasks to support deployable Incident Response Teams (IRTs). 

•  T0214 - Receive and analyze network alerts from various sources within the enterprise 

and determine possible causes of such alerts. 

•  T0233 - Track and document cybersecurity defense incidents from initial detection 

through final resolution. 

•  T0246 - Write and publish cybersecurity defense techniques, guidance, and reports on 

incident findings to appropriate constituencies. 

•  T0262 - Employ approved defense-in-depth principles and practices (e.g., defense-in-

multiple places, layered defenses, security robustness).

NICE FRAMEWORK 

•  T0278 - Collect intrusion artifacts (e.g., source code, malware, Trojans) and use 

discovered data to enable mitigation of potential cybersecurity defense incidents within 
the enterprise. 

•  T0279 - Serve as technical expert and liaison to law enforcement personnel and explain 

incident details as required. 

•  T0312 - Coordinate with intelligence analysts to correlate threat assessment data.  
•  T0164 - Perform cybersecurity defense trend analysis and reporting.  
•  T0395 - Write and publish after-action reviews. 
•  T0503 - Monitor external data sources (e.g., cybersecurity defense vendor sites, 

Computer Emergency Response Teams, Security Focus) to maintain the currency of 
cybersecurity defense threat condition and determine which security issues may have an 
impact on the enterprise. 

•  T0510 - Coordinate incident response functions. 

Furthermore, from Appendix B, we can learn the broad range of KSAs that might be needed by a 
person whose cybersecurity position includes this work role. 

Armed with this information, an organization seeking to achieve the outcome described by 
Cybersecurity Framework  
RS.MI-2 may determine whether one or more existing staff have the necessary skills to complete 
the tasks described. If one or more KSAs are lacking, the employee desiring to fill that work role 
will know specifically what areas need improvement and can seek academic classes or industry 
training to gain the necessary knowledge. If no such staff are found, the employer has specific 
Task descriptions and KSA requirements that may be advertised in a job posting, or that may be 
used for contractor staff to augment existing personnel.

Systems Security Engineering 

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Systems Security Engineering - Considerations for a 
Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems [14], addresses 
the engineering-driven actions necessary to develop more defensible and survivable systems—
including the components that compose those systems and the services that depend on them. It 
starts with and builds upon a set of well-established International Standards for systems and 
software engineering, and infuses systems security engineering techniques, methods, and 
practices into those systems and software engineering activities. The ultimate objective is to 
address security issues from a stakeholder requirements and protection needs perspective, and to 
use established engineering processes to ensure that such requirements and needs are addressed 
with the appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire life cycle of the system. Increasing the 
trustworthiness of systems is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial investment in 
the requirements, architecture, design, and development of systems, components, applications, 
and networks—and a fundamental cultural change to the current “business as usual” approach. 

Introducing a disciplined, structured, and standards-based set of systems security engineering 
activities and tasks provides an important starting point and forcing function to initiate needed

change. The ultimate objective is to obtain trustworthy secure systems that are fully capable of 
supporting critical missions and business operations while protecting stakeholder assets, and to 
do so with a level of assurance that is consistent with the risk tolerance of those stakeholders. 

Mapping components of the NICE Framework to the specialty discipline described in NIST SP 
800-160 will validate those components. Practitioners of the system security engineering 
specialty discipline will likely become subject matter experts who can justify additional KSAs 
and tasks to be added to the NICE Framework.

U.S. Office of Personnel Management Federal Cybersecurity Codes 

On January 4, 2017, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memorandum 
[15] titled “Guidance for federal agencies assigning new cybersecurity codes to positions with 
information technology, cybersecurity, and cyber-related functions”. The memorandum notes 
that the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 [16] requires OPM to 
establish procedures to implement the NICE coding structure and to identify all Federal civilian 
positions that require the performance of information technology, cybersecurity, or other cyber-
related functions. Table 9 shows the mapping of NICE Framework Work Role IDs which 
represent the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity work to OPM cybersecurity codes which 
are compatible with the OPM Enterprise Human Resources Integration system.
