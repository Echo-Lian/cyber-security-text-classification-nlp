Abstract

The  aim  of this  thesis  is  to  advance  a  theory  of friendship  and  estrangement  between 
states as an explanation for the emergence and decline of interstate security cooperation, 
defined  as  costly  investment  in  a  shared  international  institution.  It  seeks to  illuminate 
dynamics  in  (West)German-American  relations  between  1945  and  1995,  specifically 
Germany’s subsequent investment in three different security  institutions for the purpose 
of ‘European  security’  which  gradually  excluded  the  United  States:  the  North  Atlantic 
Treaty  Organization  (1945-55),  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 
(1965-75)  and  the  EU’s  Common  Foreign  and  Security  Policy  (1985-95).  Suggesting 
that  the  three  dominant  IR  paradigms -   realism,  institutionalism  and  constructivism  -  
cannot  explain  this  dynamic, the  thesis  applies  a  phenomenological  lens  to  explore  the 
parameters  of the  national  security  interest  and  the  motivation  for  security  cooperation 
by interrogating what it means for the state to exist.

Combining  insights  from  Heidegger  and  Aristotle,  the  first  part  argues  that  states  (i) 
attempt to control anxiety through the formulation of an authentic biographical narrative 
inscribed  in  space  and  time,  and  that  they  (ii)  attempt  to  stabilize  their  narrative  by 
embedding  it  in  a  project  of  ‘world  building’  negotiated  with  friends  through  shared 
institutions.  It  further  argues  that  (iii)  enduring  dissonance  within  this  relationship 
signifies a process of estrangement and  leads to a strategy of emancipation  by  investing 
in  an  alternative  institution  with  another friend.  The  second  part applies this theoretical 
frame  to  explain  the  abovementioned  dynamic  with  (dis)agreements  between  German 
and  American  policymakers  over  visions  of  European  order  embedded  in  respective 
national biographies. The thesis argues that the consensus of using NATO for building a 
‘peaceful  Europe’  in  the  Western  space  on  the  principles  of  ‘freedom’  and  ‘unity’ 
weakened when (a) US administrations came to question the desirability of the  latter for 
the American narrative and were willing to use military means to build the  ‘free world’, 
while (b) German governments came to pursue the vision of having Germany unfold in a 
Greater European Peace Order marked by ‘unity’ through peaceful means.

Acknowledgements

Writing a thesis is both a lonely journey and one that would be impossible without the 
support and stimulating input of many.

I would like to begin by thanking my dissertation supervisor, Michael Cox, for his trust 
and guidance throughout. He not only pushed me to take a closer look at the Cold War 
but also kept my feet on the ground when I risked getting lost in abstractions by 
reminding me that ‘less Heidegger would be better!’. I am also very grateful to Kimberly 
Hutchings, Mark Hoffman and Olya Gayazova for their comments on several draft 
chapters.

First attempts to organise some of the thoughts engaged in this thesis date back to my 
time spent at Rutgers University (2000-2002), made possible by a scholarship from the 
German-American Fulbright Commission. For supporting my studies at the LSE, I 
gratefully acknowledge funding from the Economic Social and Research Council 
(ESRC) and from the School/the Department of International Relations.  In the writing- 
up phase I had the privilege to spend an academic year as a Research Fellow in the quiet 
and picturesque setting of Dartmouth College, generously funded by the John Sloan 
Dickey Center for International Understanding. On the list of stimulating and sheltered 
research environments I benefited from over the years also belongs the German 
Historical Institute in London and the Otto Suhr Institute at the Free University Berlin. I 
am grateful for their open doors. An incredibly fruitful experience of a different kind 
was my time as co-editor of Millennium during my first year at the LSE, which among 
other things helped me to understand better how the market place of ideas works.

The ideas engaged in this thesis were shaped and tested in seminars and conference 
panels over the years. These forums proved crucial not only for bouncing ideas but also 
for giving me deadlines I could not ignore. For valuable discussions, comments and 
questions there,  in coffee shops and in pubs I would like to thank (in addition to those 
noted earlier): Kirsten Ainley, Cristina Barrios, Andreas Behnke, Janice Bially Mattem, 
Chris Brown, Douglas Bulloch, David Chandler, Georgios Evangelopoulos, Bastian 
Giegerich, Stefano Guzzini, Helga Haftendom, Chris Hill, Jef Huysmans, Dan Kelemen,

Complementing peers and friends at LSE, my London flatmates Alejandro, Andres and 
Caroline not only tolerated me being locked in my room on weekends but, as friends and 
companions, also did much to prevent me becoming a hermit During my time at 
Dartmouth I was glad to share with Kevin the experience of being ‘almost done’.

I could not have neither started nor completed this journey without the support of my 
parents and what I owe them cannot be expressed in words. This thesis is dedicated to 
my grandma, Margarete Beck, the last remaining family member who consciously lived 
through the historical period covered here.

Question and Objective
The aim of this thesis is to assess,  both conceptually and empirically, the motives behind 
interstate  cooperation  in  security  policy  and  why/under what  conditions  states  cease  to 
cooperate.  The  overarching  question  addressed  is  ‘what  explains  the  emergence  (rise) 
and  decline  (demise)  of  interstate  security  cooperation?’  Defining  interstate  security 
cooperation  as  the  costly  investment  in  a  shared  international  institution,  the  thesis 
applies this  question to the empirical  case of German1  -American2  cooperation  between 
1945 
explain 
Germany’ssubsequent investments in three different security  institutions for the purpose 
of  ‘European  security’,  namely  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO),  the 
Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  and  the  EU’s  Common 
Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

1995.  Specifically, 

it  develops  a 

and 

theoretical 

frame 

to 

Seen  in  the  context  of  German-American  relations,  these  investments  are  taken  as 
indicators for the emergence and decline of security cooperation  between  Germany and 
the  United  States  (US).  Specifically,  they  signify  a  dynamic  moving  from  shared 
commitment to  NATO  as  the  primary  security  institution  in  Europe  (‘consensus’),  via 
differing  commitments  to  the  CSCE  process  marked  by  strong  German  support  and 
American  reluctance to  participate (‘tension’), to German  investment in  CFSP as  a new 
institution  in  which  the  US  was  not  a  member  and  which  US  administrations  viewed 
with  suspicion  (‘divergence’).  In  short,  the  question  can  be  posed  as  ‘why  did  German 
governments  invest  in three different security  institutions  in  Europe since the end  of the 
Second World War which gradually excluded the United States?’

The  relevance of engaging these questions  is not difficult to see.  Dynamics of interstate 
security cooperation  are  integral to the  dynamics of war and  peace  and  so  investigating 
them  is  a well  established  exercise  in the  field  of International  Relations  (IR),  if not  its 
core  concern.  Yet  for the  most part this  does  not entail  scrutinizing the  motivations,  or 
shared  ‘security  interests’,  on  which  decisions  for  cooperation  are  based.  Rather  than 
fixing  them  on  the  level  of  assumptions,  this  thesis  problematizes  the  meaning  of 
‘security  interests’  by  building  on  literature  pointing  to  their  political  and  context- 
specific nature.  It reaches down to the level of ontology to rethink the constitution of the

state  and  the  parameters  within  which 
is  formulated  and, 
consequently, within which  ‘common’  security  interests  must be  situated  to  understand 
when security cooperation is likely to occur, endure, and decline.

its  ‘security  interest’ 

The theoretical exploration of these parameters makes up a significant part of the thesis. 
In  a  nutshell,  the  argument  advanced  is  that  common  institutional  investments  signify 
projects of ‘world  building’  among friends driven by the attempt to control  ‘anxiety’  by 
establishing  an  authentic  biographical  narrative.  The  decline  of such  relations,  marked 
by the decision  of at least one side to  invest in  an  alternative  institution  which  does  not 
include the previous partner,  is said to be a reaction to a process of estrangement and the 
decision to pursue a strategy of emancipation. With developing this argument, this thesis 
is  not  merely  offering  an  explanation  for  the  aforementioned  dynamics  of  German- 
American  security  cooperation  but  is  also  outlining  a  new  theory  of interstate  security 
cooperation

The  German-American  relationship  between  1945  and  1995  provides  an  important  and 
challenging  case  for  exploring  dynamics  of  interstate  security  cooperation.  It  is 
important  because  the  two  states  are  key  actors  in  the  Euro-American  region  and  core 
member of NATO, hence the ‘health’  of their relationship affects the cohesiveness of the 
transatlantic  link,  sometimes  also  called  ‘the  West’,  and  the  vitality  of  the  Atlantic 
Alliance.  Taking  a  fresh  look  at  this  relationship  from  a  long  term  perspective  is 
therefore  not  only  of historical  interest.  It  is  hoped  that  by  “expanding  the  data  base” 
(Gaddis,  1987)  the  findings  of this  thesis  will  allow  scholars  and  practitioners to  better 
understand  the  opportunities  and  limits  of US-German  cooperation  today  and  improve 
expectations about their support for security institutions  in Europe in the future.

The challenge is that by most measures these two states make for rather unequal partners 
and,  for a significant part of the  period  under investigation,  appear in  a hegemon-client 
relationship marked by one-sided dependency rather than eye-to-eye cooperation.  In this 
narrative,  the  US  emerged  out  of the  Second  World  War  as  the  leader  of  ‘the  West’ 
fixated on the  Soviet Union  whereas  Germany emerged  as  an  occupied  state thrust  into 
the  arena  of  superpower  competition  without  much  opportunity  for  agency  (e.g., 
Haftedom  1985;  Hanrieder  1989).  The  thesis  offers  a  slightly  different  perspective. 
Supporting  the  scholarly  agenda  of  decentering  Cold  War  history,  it  pays  particular 
attention  to  the  German  role  to  assess  and  retrieve  the  agency  governments  in  Bonn 
exercised during the periods  in which those three  institutions emerged:  (i) The post-war 
decade  (1945-55)  characterized  by  a  consensus  about  NATO  as  the  primary  security

10

institution  in  Europe, (ii) the period  of Ostpolitik/detente (1965-75)  showing differences 
in  opinion  over the  need  and  relevance  of CSCE,  and  (iii)  the  decade  surrounding the 
end  of the  Cold  War (1985-95)  marked  by  German  investment  in  CFSP  as  a  potential 
alternative  institution  to  NATO  and  from  which  the  US  is  excluded.  Applying  the 
theoretical  argument mentioned  earlier,  this  dynamic  is  explained  with  (dis)agreements 
among political  leaders over visions of European order embedded  in respective national 
biographies,  signifying  a  movement  of  German-American  security  relations  from 
friendship to estrangement, culminating in Bonn’s emancipation by investing in CFSP.

Contribution
The  theoretical  contribution  can  be  summarised  as  follows:  in  addition  to  offering  a 
certain understanding of ‘theory’  in  IR, this thesis contributes to the analytical toolkit by 
advancing a  new  causal  narrative  made  up  of three  building blocks:  (i) the  notion  that 
states  are  driven  by  an  attempt  to  control  anxiety,  (ii)  an  ontology  of the  state  as  a 
national  biography inscribed  in space and time and (iii) a conceptualization  of interstate 
relations  as  ‘friendship’  and  an  argument for the  formation and  the  breakdown thereof. 
How  these  building  blocks  are  conceptually  embedded  in  the  IR  literature  is  discussed 
throughout the six theoretical chapters and summarised in the conclusion.

As  for the  empirical  contribution,  I  am  not  aware  of an  analysis  of German-American 
security  cooperation  that  focuses  on  the  question  outlined  above.  By  addressing  this 
question  the  thesis  contributes  to  research  on  three  levels.  First,  as  already  noted,  it 
stresses  the  creative  role  of German  agency.  Second,  it  strengthens  the  view  that  the 
security  interdependence  between  Germany and  the  US  was  generated  internally  rather 
than  by  an  external  threat.  These  two  points  will  be  made  by  placing  the  three 
institutions  -  NATO,  CSCE,  CFSP  -   in  one  analytical  story.  By  doing  so,  the  thesis, 
third,  contributes  to  a  literature  which,  thus  far,  is  characterised  by  imbalance  and 
disconnect.  While there  is  a  large  literature dealing with  German-American relations  in 
NATO  in the post-war decade, most of it is confined to a military strategic angle. There 
is  very  little  literature  on  the  CSCE  process  and  almost nothing on  its  role  in  German- 
American  relations.  And  most  of the  literature  on  CFSP  is  embedded  in  analyses  of 
‘EUropean  Foreign  Policy’  where  the  US,  not  being  a  member of the  EU,  falls  off the 
analytical  radar.  This thesis  levels out this  imbalance and  connects the three  institutions 
in  a  single  study.  In  other  words,  it  treats  NATO,  CSCE  and  CFSP  as  ‘equals’  by 
starting  from  the  premise  that  they  all  deal  with  ‘European  security’  and  takes  their 
difference  in  design  as  an  invitation  to  explore  how  states  come  to  have  different 
understandings about what makes ‘Europe’  secure.

The  remainder  of this  introduction  proceeds  as  follows.  The  next  section  clarifies  the 
phenomenon  of (non)cooperation,  followed  by  identifying  the  parameters  along  which 
competing explanations can be assessed. The third section outlines the inadequacy of the 
explanations  derived  from  three  major  IR  paradigms  (realism,  institutionalism  and 
constructivism).  The  fourth  section  addresses  issues  of research  design  before,  finally, 
presenting brief summaries of the individual major chapters.

Defining the Puzzle
A  ‘puzzle’  is  an  intellectual  challenge  posed  by  an  empirical  phenomenon  against  the 
backdrop of existing theories,  or ways  of understanding how the  world  works.  For this, 
the  necessary  first  step 
the  phenomenon,  namely  what  signifies 
(non)cooperation.  This  is  by  no  means  an  easy  task.  As  Robert  Keohane  warned,  “the 
phenomenon  of  cooperation 
its  sources  are  sufficiently 
multifaceted  and  intertwined,  that  it  constitutes  a  difficult  subject  to  study”  (Keohane, 
1984:  10).  And  indeed, two decades after Robert Jervis pointed  out that the  meaning of 
cooperation  is  often  left  unclear  in  studies  dealing  with  this  very  topic  (Jervis,  1988: 
330), substantive definitions are still spare.3

is  elusive  enough,  and 

In  the  most  basic  understanding  cooperation  designates  ‘joint’  action  or  decision­
making.  This  is  different  from  ‘alignment’  (Snyder,  1997:  6ff)  in  that the  latter can  be 
understood  as  a more passive  ‘taking sides’  lacking  interaction and, thus,  politics.  That 
said,  many  studies  define  ‘joint’  action  negatively  rather  than  positively,  that  is,  they 
contrast cooperation against a relationship marked by of conflict, confrontation, discord, 
or  simply  ‘competition’  (Keohane,  1984;  Grieco,  1990;  Stein,  1990).4  But  even  the 
meaning of these phenomena is often  left sufficiently vague.  For instance, defection, the 
juxtaposition to cooperation  prominent in  game theory  and  formal  modelling,  is  simply 
described  as  “cheating”  on  an  existing  or  expected  arrangement  (Stein,  1990:  42)  and 
‘exploiting’  or  ‘taking  advantage’  of the  other  actor  within  a  given  “payoff structure” 
(Jervis,  1978;  1988;  Axelrod,  1984).  To  get a  meaningful  grasp  on  the  phenomenon  of 
(non)cooperation  it  is  necessary to  go  beyond  these  simple juxtapositions.  Cooperation 
is  more  than  the  absence  of  ‘conflict’  or  ‘competition’  between  two  parties,  and 
‘defection’  understood  as  ‘cheating’  carries  little  analytical  weight outside the trade-off 
matrix of the prisoner’s dilemma (or Rousseau’s stag hunt, for that matter).

4 Competition does not necessarily designate confrontation but unilateral action (Glaser  1994: 95) 
or “independent decision-making” (Stein  1982: 324, in Baldwin,  1993: 4, 4 Iff).

In this thesis cooperation  is not understood as an instantaneous decision but as a process, 
that  is,  something occurring over time.  It builds  on  Keohane’s definition  of cooperation 
as  the  phenomenon  when  “the  politics  actually  followed  by  one  government  are 
regarded by its partners as facilitating realization of their own objectives, as the result of 
a  process  of  policy  coordination”.  Importantly,  this  process  implies  change  where 
“actions  of  separate 
individuals...be  brought  into  conformity  with  one  another” 
(Keohane,  1984:  5If,  emphasis  added).  This  is  echoed  by  Grieco  (1990:  22) who  adds 
the  qualification  of cooperation  as  “voluntary  adjustment”  of policies,  thereby  limiting 
cooperation  to those  relationships  where  policy  coordination  was  not  a consequence  of 
coercion  but of choice, thus  implying agency.  Taken together, cooperation thus  requires 
the  convergence  of policies  through  a  process  of mutual  coordination  and  voluntary 
adjustment. The qualification that these policies are  ‘actually followed’  is  important and 
points  out  that  cooperation  goes  beyond  rhetoric  and  distinguishes,  in  Morgenthau’s 
(1960:  186)  words,  an  operative  from  an  inoperative  alliance.  In  this  sense,  following 
Grieco (1990) and  Stein (1990),  cooperation  is defined  as costly  investment in  a shared 
institutions (or regime) on the international level over a period of time.

Institutions  are  understood  here  along  the  lines  of  Stephen  Krasner’s  well-known 
definition  as  “sets  of implicit  or  explicit  principles,  norms,  rules  and  decision-making 
procedures around which actors’  expectations converge” (Krasner,  1983:  2) and  refer to 
political  agreements  and  treaties  outlining  common  aims,  means,  and  responsibilities 
incorporated  in  formal  organizations  (Hasenclever  et  al.,  1996).  In  and  of  itself 
membership  in  the  same  institution  and  occasional  expressions  of  solidarity  is  not  a 
sufficient  indicator for  a cooperative  partnership.  What  is  required  is  costly  investment 
in the shared  institution, understood as the mobilization of significant political capital to 
influence 
the  establishment/reform  of 
organizational  elements  and/or  use  of  the  same.  Cooperation  as  substantial  and 
reciprocated  political  and  financial  investment towards common practices,  ranging from 
consultation  and  shared  strategic  planning  to  common  action  in  crisis  situations, 
inevitably  involves  the  conscious  sacrifice  of some  degree  of  independence  (Wolfers, 
1962:27).

The  simplest  indicator  for  non-cooperation  would  be  the  resignation  of  institutional 
membership,  that  is,  the  formal  termination  of the  contractual  agreement  under  which 
the common institution was established. Yet, again, such a definition could not grasp the 
process of a disintegrating relationship, as everything short of un-signing a treaty would

13

move outside the analytical focus.  In line with the above, non-cooperation is understood 
here  not  as  a  sudden  breakdown  of relations  but  as  a degenerative  process  playing  out 
over  time.  While  ‘defection’  generally  does  not  grasp  this  long-term  perspective,  its 
definition  as “the action  of falling away from allegiance or adherence to a  leader, party, 
or cause” (OED Online) or as the “conscious abandonment of allegiance or duty (as to a 
person,  cause,  or  doctrine)”  and  “withdrawing  support  or  help  despite  allegiance  or 
responsibility”  (Merriam  Webster  Online)  is  nevertheless  instructive.  Although  in  the 
context  of interstate  relations  it  may  seem  more  appropriate  to  speak  of the  fading  of 
‘solidarity’  than  ‘allegiance’,  the  notion  of withdrawing  support from  a  common  cause 
reminds  that  cooperation  is  goal-oriented.  Non-cooperation  thus  may  be  expressed  in 
both  passive  non-compliance  with  and  severe  disputes  over the  common  cause,  and  in 
the  independent  formulation  and  pursuit  of  policy  against  the  expectation  of  shared 
practice.

As  it  is  difficult  to  establish  a  threshold  for  when  non-compliance,  disputes  and 
independent decision-making count as non-cooperation, the favouring of an  ‘alternative’ 
is  an  important  element.5  To  be  an  alternative the  new  institution  must cover the  same 
policy  realm  and  designed  to  fulfil  a  similar  purpose,  thus  having,  or  be  perceived  as 
having,  the  potential  to  rival  or  compete  with  the  old  institution  (Biermann  2007).6 
Hence, inversing the definition of cooperation outlined earlier, the demise of cooperative 
relationship  is  defined  here  as  a  process  in  which  a  state  ceases  to  give  priority  to  the 
common  security  institution,  signified  by  costly  investment  in  an  alternative  institution 
over a period of time which does not include the previous partner.

Through  this  conceptual  frame  Germany’s  subsequent  investment  in  three  different 
institutions  for  the  purpose  of  providing  for  ‘European  security’  which  gradually 
excluded the  United  States -  NATO,  CSCE,  CFSP -  reads  as  a dynamic moving  from 
cooperation  to  non-cooperation.  This  phenomenon  turns  into  a  ‘puzzle’  in  light  of the 
inability of existing IR theories to explain it.

Sorting Existing Theories
While  historians  would  explore  the  three  decades  of  consensus  (1945-55);  tension 
(1965-75); and divergence (1985-1995) in great detail to offer a rich and nuanced picture 
of the  political  dynamics  surrounding  (and  leading  to)  the  institutional  investments  in

organization to join another one (Hirschman,  1970).

each  case,  IR  scholars  approach  history  more  selectively  by  viewing  it  through  a 
theoretical prism which deliberately highlights some aspects and neglects others. Indeed, 
for some IR scholars meaningful analysis  is only possible “with the guidance of theory” 
(Waltz  1979:  5)  holding  that  “theory  is  inescapable;  all  empirical  or  practical  analysis 
rests on  it” (Keohane and Nye  1989:  4).  As discussed in more detail  in the next chapter, 
behind this  is the conviction that the  ‘interpretative bias’  permeating all  research  is best 
compensated  for  by  explicitly  laying  out  the  conceptual  framework  through  which  the 
historical material is approached.  Instead of empirical richness IR scholars (should) offer 
a  clearly  stated  angle  focusing  on  a  few  but  (allegedly)  central  factors  explaining  the 
phenomenon  at  hand.  Yet  when  existing  theofies  are  not  capable  of  grasping  an 
empirical  phenomenon  and, 
the 
researcher  is  left with  a  ‘puzzle’.  The  following  suggests that the  dominant IR theories 
on  interstate  (security)  cooperation  fail  to  fully  explain  the  empirical  phenomenon  at 
hand and that, in response to that puzzle, more careful theoretical reflection is needed.

The Question of the  ‘Common Security Interest'
To  assess  the  adequacy  of the  dominant  IR theories7  for  explaining  interstate  security 
(non)cooperation -  structural realism, neoliberal  institutionalism, social constructivism -  
there is the question whether/on what basis they can be compared. After all, despite their 
broad  commitment  to  illuminate  the  issues  of  conflict  and  cooperation,  theories  are 
constructed  for  different  reasons  and  tailored  towards  explaining  different things,  thus, 
they may  not  speak to  each  other.  In the  present context,  the  question  of comparability 
comes  to  light  of  two  concepts  generally  kept  apart  in  the  IR  literature,  namely 
‘alliances’  and ‘security communities’.

‘Alliance’  is  the  older  term  found  in  writings  of  political  thinkers,  historians,  and 
military  planners  dating  back  centuries.  It  is  used  in  traditional  security  studies 
dominated by realism and game theory and, correspondingly, is the focus of the first two 
abovementioned approaches (structural realism and neoliberal  institutionalism). Broadly 
speaking,  an  alliance  designates  a temporary  military  coalition  formed  in  the  face  of a 
(potential)  common  enemy.  Whether for  offensive  or defensive/deterrence  purposes,  in 
this  literature  alliances  are  a  temporary  phenomena  of collaboration  formed  against  a 
common  military threat,  and  thus,  under the  prospect of war (Morgenthau,  1960;  Walt,

7 For a discussion on the meaning of theory and its adequacy, see the following chapter.

15

1987;  Snyder,  1997).8  The  notion  of a  ‘security  community’  is  of more  recent  origin. 
Often  linked to the Kantian notion of a ‘foedus pacificum’, the term was coined by Karl 
Deutsch  and  colleagues  in  the  1950s  and  over  the  past  decade  has  gained  popularity 
among  social  constructivists.  It  designates  the  very  absence  of war  among  states  or, 
positively speaking, collaboration for peace.  More than a simple nonaggression treaty, a 
security community describes a  long-term  association among states who have agreed to 
solve  all  disagreements  between  them  through  peaceful  means,  making  war  between 
them “unthinkable”.9

In  short,  it  appears  alliances  are  organised  against  something  (an  external  enemy)  and 
externally oriented,  whereas  security communities are organised fo r something (internal 
peace),  or  internally  oriented.10  In  addition,  the  scholarly  communities  favouring  the 
concepts of ‘alliances’  and  ‘security communities’  are often  seen  as embedding them  in 
two  distinct ways  of thinking  about  interstate  relations,  emphasizing a certain  ‘logic  of 
anarchy’  in which states pursue their interests by following a logic of consequence and a 
‘logic  of  community’  where  states  act  according  to  a  logic  of  appropriateness, 
respectively.

least  one 

important  aspect 

Without  denying  these  differences  in  emphasis  (as  chapter  three  shows,  the  major 
theories contain  both  ‘logics’), one must be careful of not overstating the differences.  In 
at 
the  conceptualizations  of  alliances  and  security 
communities  build  on  common  ground.  Leaving  aside  alliances  formed  for  strictly 
offensive purposes,11  there  is no  intrinsic reason to treat an  arrangement formed against 
a threat and one for peace as two different things. If anything, these are two sides of the 
same motivational  coin  as  both  alliances and  security communities are formed by states 
for  reasons  of  ‘national  security’.  To just  mention  a  few  examples,  in  their  extensive 
literature review, Holsti et al. (1973:  4) define alliances as “a formal agreement between 
two or more nations to collaborate on national security issues”. Joseph Grieco (1990:  12) 
understands  alliances  as  “a  formal  or  informal  arrangement  for  security  cooperation 
between  two  or  more  sovereign  states”,  a  definition  almost  identical  to  the  one  put 
forward by Stephen Walt (1987:  1). Among the handful of scholars advancing the notion

8  Glenn  Snyder  defines  alliances  as  “formal  associations  of states  for  the  use  (or  nonuse)  of 
military  force,  in  specified  circumstances,  against  states  outside their own  membership”  whose 
primary purpose is thus “to pool military strength against a common enemy” (Snyder 1997: 4).
9 Deutsch et al.  (1957); Adler (1997a);  Adler and Barnett (1998).  Snyder’s (1997:  11) definition 
of an entente appears to describe a similar phenomenon. See also Kann (1976).
10 See also Wolfer’s (1962) distinction between collective defense and collective security.
11  Even offensively  geared alliances are,  in the words of one observer,  often “rationalized in the 
service of the alleged goal of peace” (Kann  1976: 614).

of  security  community,  Emmanuel  Adler  (1998:  120)  speaks  about  formations  of 
“cooperative  security”  and  Thomas  Risse-Kappen  (1995)  frames  NATO  as  a  security 
community  whose  members  cooperate  because  they  perceive  their  state  of security  as 
interlinked.

Understanding (non)cooperation through the objective of maintaining ‘national  security’ 
falls  back  on  three  basic  assumptions  in  which  the  three  paradigms  converge:  First, 
states  are egoistic or self-interested actors and  pursue this  interest  in a rational manner. 
This  may  sound  surprising  to  those  who  associate  constructivism  with  explaining 
‘irrational’  or  ‘altruistic’  behaviour.  While  this  impression  may  have  been  fostered  by 
some  first-generation  constructivists  who  presented  their  approach  as  an  alternative  to 
so-called  ‘rational  choice’  explanations,  it  since  has  become  accepted  that the  ‘rational 
actor’  assumption  is  not  reserved  for  utilitarian  approaches.  In  its  most  basic  form, 
rationality  holds  that  actors  make  decisions  based  on  cost-benefit  calculations,  or 
estimates  of gains  and  losses,  and  how  these  are  defined  depends  on  what  the  actor 
intends  to  achieve,  that  is,  depends  on  the  definition  of its  goals,  or  basic  interests.  In 
short,  rational  action refers to  behaviour “designed to  further the actor’s  perceived  self- 
interest” (Monroe,  1991:  l),12 which  is another way of saying that states are  ‘egoists’  or 
‘interest-satisficers’ (Simon,  1984).13

Hence,  second,  decisions  about cooperation  can  be traced  back to  the  national security 
interest of the  respective  states  involved.  That  states  cooperate  (or not)  because  it  is  in 
their  interest to  do  so  is  not  a  ‘realist’  assumption  but  a view  readily  shared  across  the 
theoretical spectrum. Few IR scholars would contest Morgenthau’s point that “interest is 
the  perennial  standard  by  which  political  action  must  be judged”  (Morgenthau,  1960: 
10),  if only  because  ‘interest’  is  an  analytically  empty  concept  which  easily  becomes 
tautological  unless  specified.14  Saying  that  states  seek  ‘security’  only  begets  the 
subsequent question what exactly that means.

12  Monroe  (1991:  4)  lists  four  foundational  assumptions  of rational  action,  namely  (1)  actors 
pursue goals, (2) these goals reflect the actor’s perceived self-interest, (3) behavior results from a 
process  that  actually  involves  conscious  choice,  and  (4)  the  individual  is  the  basic  actor  in 
society.
13 The debate in the social sciences in the  1990s over the merits of ‘rational choice’  came down to 
the  question  whether  or  not  interests,  and  the  preferences  derived  from  them,  should  be 
exogenously defined (i.e. fixed) and,  if so, whether they should be contextualized and,  if so, how 
(Monroe,  1991,  2001;  Green  and  Shapiro,  1994;  Levy,  1997b).  This  thesis  supports  the 
contextual approach, for reasons discussed in the next chapter.

The need to specify and justify the reading of the  ‘national security interest’  becomes all 
the  more  important  in  light  of,  third,  the  assumption  that  cooperation  is  based  on 
common  (security)  interests. As Keohane puts it cooperation occurs because states “have 
interests  in  common  which  can  only  be  realized  through  cooperation”  (Keohane  1984: 
6).  Again,  IR  scholars  will  not  disagree  over  the  view  that  states  cooperate  to  satisfy 
the(ir)  ‘common  interest’  and  that,  conversely,  they  will  stop  cooperating  when  the 
‘common  interest’  is missing.15  The  key question  is what makes  interests  ‘common’.  In 
most basic terms,  it can  be  said that  ‘common’  does not  imply an  ‘identity’  of interests 
which,  as  Keohane  (1984;  1988:  380)  points  out,  would  prompt  automatic  co-action. 
Instead,  the  ‘common’  must  leave  room  for  a  process  of  ‘voluntary  adjustment’  and, 
hence,  politics.  Beyond  that,  specifying what  makes  security  interests  ‘common’  is  the 
basic task of any theoretical explanation.

The Silence o f the Camps
By specifying this  ‘common  security interest’  on the basis of which two states would be 
willing to  invest in  a shared  international  institution  it is possible to compare arguments 
derived  from  those  three  major  IR  theories  dealing  with  international  cooperation, 
namely (structural) realism, (neoliberal) institutionalism and (social) constructivism. The 
following  suggests that the  logical  thrust  of each  of the  three  theories  leaves too  many 
blank spots when trying to make sense of the phenomenon at hand.

The most prominent argument coming out of (structural  or neo-)realism  holds that in  an 
anarchical  environment  states  will  cooperate  on  the  basis  of a  common  threat,  more 
precisely  when  facing  a  great  power,  by  balancing  against  it.16  In  line  with  balance  of 
power  logic,  shifts  in  cooperative  behavior  are  expected  to  follow  shifts  in  the 
distribution  of  power  in  the  international  system,  with  institutional  investments  thus 
being  epiphenomena  of  the  balance  of  power  dynamic.  For  the  case  at  hand  this 
argument is of little  use.  While the  inherent conceptual  vagueness (or contestedness)  of

15  A  word  on  the  place  of  ‘trust’  in  the  argument:  If trust  is  about  “actors  grant(ing)  others 
discretion  over  their  interests  based  on  the  belief  that  those  interests  will  not  be  harmed” 
(Hoffman  2002:  377),  this  can  be  seen  as  an  presupposing  (a  belief in)  a  common  interest.  As 
such, trust can be seen as a consequence of there being a common  interest and is manifested in a 
three-part relation  of the kind  ‘A trusts  B  to do  x’  (Hardin  1998:  12).  It also must be  noted that 
complete  trust  is  not  a  necessary  condition  for  cooperation  to  occur  (Hardin  2002;  Hoffman 
2002).  Otherwise  there  could  be  no  cooperation  from  a  realist  point  of view,  which  holds  that 
inter-state  relations  are  characterized  by  mutual  distrust.  While  institutionalists  argue  that 
institutions allow  for ‘trust within limits’,  constructivists argue that states can  learn to fully trust 
each  other  by  identifying  with  each  other.  This  fits  with  Hardin’s  (2002:  58f)  point  that  trust 
cannot be  chosen  but “just  is”,  which  moves  attention  to  the  question  why  states  identify  with 
each other. This thesis offers an answer to this question.

‘power’  makes measuring the distribution of power notoriously difficult,  on the basis of 
conventional  realist  indicators  such  as economic prosperity and  military capabilities the 
US  was  the  strongest  player  coming  out  of  the  Second  World  War  and  was  also 
recognized by  West German political  leaders as  such.17  Hence,  German  investment into 
NATO  must  count  as  bandwagoning.  Investment  in  CSCE  and  CFSP  also  does  not 
amount to  a  balancing  act  in  realist  terms  as  these  institutions  were  not  linked  to  (or 
accompanied by) an enhancement in Germany’s military power and, thus, from a realitst 
perspective  do  not  count  as  alternatives  to  NATO.  Even  if  one  would  frame  these 
investments  as  tacit  balancing  attempts,  this  would  need  to  be  traced  to  a  shift  in  the 
global balance of power in which Germany became wary of a growth in US power.  Yet 
if anything  from  1965  to  1975,  and  certainly  in  the  second  half of that  period  when 
German support for CSCE became strong, there was a sense of declining US power (due 
in  large  parts  to  Vietnam).  And  while  the  third  period  (1985-95)  could  be  read  as 
Germany reacting to  an  emerging unipolar world  under US  hegemony,  investment  into 
CFSP  does  not  qualify  as  a  ‘weak  form’  of hard  balancing,  despite  some  attempts  to 
frame  it  as  such  (Posen  2006:  164).  German  governments  were  unwilling  to  increase 
military  expenditure  despite  US  pressure  to  do  so.  Indeed,  the  opposite  was  the  case: 
between  1985 and  1995 the defence budget was reduced.18

‘stability’.  Correspondingly,  Investments in an alternative institution could  be explained 
with  smaller/weaker  states’  fears  of ‘abandonment’  and  the  rise  of instability  (Snyder 
1997). On this basis one could argue that Germany was bandwagoning in the first period 
because  it  felt  comfortable  with  the  US  as  a  provider  for  ‘stability’.  For  subsequent 
periods  the  argument  might  be  that  German  governments  worried  about  a  possible 
withdrawal of the American  ‘security umbrella’  expressed  in a waning US  commitment 
to NATO.19 As discussed  in this thesis, the main empirical  problem this argument faces

18  Sarotte  (2001:  19).  Attributing CFSP to  a desire  for  ‘soft  balancing’  (Pape  2005;  Paul  2005), 
that  is,  an  attempt  to  constrain  US  power  through  diplomatic  pressure  and  by  entangling  it  in 
multilateral  institutions,  is  even  less  plausible.  Security  institutions  are  not  needed  to  provide 
Germany with  economic leverage vis-a-vis the US. And even  if Germany would be seen  as using 
CFSP  to  strengthen  international  bodies  such  as  the  UN,  it  is  a  stretch  to  say  that  the  primary 
reason  for doing so  would  be  to  constrain  the  US.  See  also  Brooks  and  Wohlforth  (2005:  9 If); 
Ho worth (2007: 47f).
19 Snyder (1984:  486) suggests that  ‘abandonment’  concerns of West Europeans during the Cold 
War  were  more  part  of  a  political  game  as  they  never  really  expected  the  US  to  abandon

demands  in  Congress  to  reduce  US  troop  presence  in  Europe  and  the  US  hesitancy  to 
intervene  in  Bosnia  in  the  early  1990s,  there  never  were  serious  plans  in  the  White 
House  to  withdraw NATO’s  ‘security  umbrella’  from  Germany.  Yet the  main  problem 
this approach faces is theoretical: not only is ‘stability’ too vague conceptually to qualify 
as a common security interest, moreover it is  logically impossible to formulate opposing 
arguments  (balancing/bandwagoning)  out  of  the  same  realist  paradigm  (Legro  and 
Moravcsik  1999; see also chapter three).

Institutionalism,  by  definition,  pays  considerable  attention  to  international  institutions. 
They  are  seen  as  valuable  providers  of  information  which  alleviate  the  security-  and 
collective  action  dilemmas  arising  among  states  in  an  anarchical  setting  by creating  an 
environment  in  which  credible  commitments  between  states  become  feasible.20  The 
attractiveness/value of an  institution  depends  on  its efficiency to perform this task.  This 
approach  has  two  central  weaknesses,  however,  which  make  it  unsuitable  for  making 
sense  of  the  dynamic  in  the  case  at  hand.  Conceptually  speaking,  the  force  of  the 
institutionalist argument enters only once common interests among states are assumed to 
exist.  Hence,  while  it  is  useful  to  explain  how  institutions  enable  states to  pursue  these 
interests  more  effectively,  the  theory  is  indeterminate  about  what  makes  a  ‘common 
security  interest’.21  It  thus  offers  little  theoretical  traction  as  to  what  leads  Bonn  and 
Washington to invest in NATO together other than  labeling  it (ex-post) as the  ‘rational’ 
thing to do.  Furthermore, German  investment in  CSCE (and  then  CFSP) would  only  be 
explicable  if  it  could  be  shown  that  NATO  (and  then  CSCE)  were  ‘inefficient’  in 
addressing  German  security  interests.  Yet  without  a  clear  definition  of  the  latter, 
(in)efficiency remains an empty concept. Moreover, due to its rootedness in functionalist 
logic,  institutionalism  faces  the  problem  that  its  emphasis  on  ‘sunk  costs’  creates  an 
argument biased towards  path-dependency (Pierson,  2000;  Keohane  1988).  This  makes 
it  useful  for  explaining  how  institutions  contribute  to  the  persistence  or  increase  in 
cooperation  but  ill-suited  for  explaining  the  emergence  and  the  demise  of cooperative 
arrangements as defined earlier.22

21  In  the  1980s  and  90s  neoliberal  institutionalists  were  absorbed  in  the  debate  with  neorealists 
about  how  much  cooperation  was  possible  in  anarchy  assuming  the  existence  of  ‘common 
interests’.  In an  influential article on the neo-neo debate, Jervis (1999) does not even touch on the 
question why states would want to cooperate or why existing arrangements would weaken.

more generally displaying the path-dependency bias, see Smith (2004).

Finally, the (social) constructivist approach,  in overlap with sociological  institutionalism 
and  writings  on  security  communities,  emphasizes  the  influence  of  institutions  in 
shaping  identities  and,  subsequently,  interests  of its  members.23  It puts  emphasis on  the 
phenomenon  of  ‘socialization’  and,  crudely  speaking,  explains  cooperation  with  the 
existence of a shared (‘collective’) identity embedded in common institutions. While this 
perspective  often  speaks  of  identities  and  institutions  co-constituting  each  other,  its 
sympathy  for  sociological  structuralism  renders  institutions  often  as  “chief socializing 
agents” (Finnemore and  Sikkink,  1998:  902).  It suggests that  if only  states  interact long 
enough  and  within  the  right  institutions,  they  will  increasingly  ‘internalize’  collective 
norms around which shared  identities revolve and, thus, progress towards an ever closer 
union.  The problem with this  socialization is twofold.  First,  it reads  like a constructivist 
version  of Haas’  functionalism  (Risse  2005),  that  is,  it  suffers  from  the  same  built-in 
bias  towards  path-dependency  leaving  veiy  little  thought  to  how  such  communities 
could  dissolve.  Hence,  as  with  institutionalism  the  social  constructivist  approach  has 
great difficulties of explaining how two states deeply embedded in a common institution 
(NATO)  and  sharing  a  collective  identity  (the  West)  could  drift  apart.24  This  is  a 
symptom  of the  second  and  deeper  problem  that  by  anchoring  common  interests  in  a 
shared  identity  the  theory  must necessarily  address  the  issue  of identity  formation  and, 
by extension, dissolution. However, as discussed  in chapter three, existing constructivist 
approaches do so unsatisfactorily.

In  sum, judged  on  their  basic  logic  the  dominant  theoretical  approaches  in  IR  are  ill- 
equipped  to  make  sense  of  (‘explain’)  the  phenomenon  because  they  suffer  from  a 
balancing  bias  (realism),  a  sunk-cost  bias  (institutionalism)  and  a  socialization  bias 
(constructivism).

The  researcher  is  hence  left  with  a  puzzle  to  which  (s)he  can  respond  in  one  of two 
ways.  The  first response would be to take one  of the theories  and  adjust  it/the evidence 
in  a  way  that  makes  an  existing  theory  ‘work’.  This  arguably  is  the  road  preferred  by 
most  scholars.25  It  leads  to  studies  where,  hidden  in  more  or  less  sophisticated 
methodological frameworks, comparisons o f ‘competing’ explanations end up validating 
one.  Yet  if we  accept  Donald  Spence’s  (1982:  245)  point  that  “each  interpretation  is

makes it difficult for moderate constructivists to come to terms with change, see Sending (2002).

guided,  unwittingly,  by  our  favorite  paradigm”  the  exercise  of  bending  competing 
theories to the  case to  ‘test’  their  ‘accuracy’  is not necessarily persuasive.26 The  second 
road, taken  here, asks what is wrong with  existing theories  and  instead  of ‘fixing’  them 
takes  the  puzzle  as  an  invitation/opportunity  to  rethink  the  causal  narrative.  In  other 
words,  it  aims  at  a  new  theory  of security  cooperation  which  can  make  sense  of the 
phenomenon  at  hand.  This  is  arguably the  more  difficult  road  to take,  also  because the 
IR literature provides little guidance on how to build a theory (see next chapter).

The  first  question  arising  is  where  to  start,  and  an  intuitive  answer  would  be  ‘with  the 
fundamentals’.  Thus,  following the  point  made previously,  the  thesis  begins the theory 
building enterprise at the level where the conception o f ‘security interests’ comes to rest. 
In effect, this requires engaging questions of ontology, starting with  a conceptualization 
of the  state.  The  next chapter will justify this  approach,  yet a first hint at why this  is  a 
useful point of departure is given by the phenomenon at hand. IR theories operating with 
a  Weberian  (or  Westphalian)  conception  of the  state  face  the  problem  that the  Federal 
Republic was not a fully sovereign state until 3  October  1990.  This  is not simply a legal 
issue.  If one applies the  Weberian definition of the state as a community possessing the 
monopoly over the  legitimate use of force in a designated territory, the massive presence 
of foreign  troops  on  the  FRG’s  territory  and  the  fact that the Bundeswehr could  not be 
used 
(i.e.  US)  consent  significantly 
compromises the core feature of the FRG as a ‘state’. Certainly for the first period where 
Germany was  formally under occupation,  one  could  well  argue that the  FRG was not a 
state.27  Consequently,  German-American  relations  did  not  amount  to  phenomenona  of 
inter-state cooperation.  Rather than brushing over this conceptual problem by noting that 
sovereignty  is  a contested term, this thesis takes the ambiguous status of the FRG as an 
invitation for thinking more carefully about the meaning of the state.

Research Design
As justified  and discussed  more fully  in the  next chapter, the thesis  pursues the task of 
theory  building,  or  what  is  called  here  ‘creative  theorizing’,  not  primarily  through 
empirical  analysis  but  by  engaging  other  theories.  This,  in  turn,  rests  on  a  specific 
understanding  of what  a  theory  is.  In  a  nutshell,  the  thesis  takes  a  ‘deep  theorizing’ 
perspective  which  reaches  down  to  the  level  of  ontology  to  make  the  phenomenon

26  A  good  example  is  Moravcsik  (1998).  While  a  methodologically  sophisticated  and  balanced 
study, it is difficult to ignore the feeling that among his competing hypotheses for what drove the 
process  of  European  integration,  the  ‘winning’  one  (economic  interests)  is  also  the  author’s 
favorite.

intelligible  by  placing  it  in the  context of the  ‘human condition’.  Theory  understood  in 
this  way  serves  as  preparation  for  ‘unravelling’  the  three  paradigms  outlined  earlier 
(realism,  institutionalism, constructivism), that  is,  it provides a roadmap for carving out 
core  insights as well as exposing conceptual tensions which can be carried forward for a 
new theory of security cooperation. The  intellectual space opened up by this approach  is 
filled with  insights taken from the philosophy of,  in particular,  Heidegger and Aristotle. 
My  reliance  on  them  at different  stages  of the  argument  is  an  attempt to  creatively  use 
their insights and weave them  into a coherent whole.  It does not intend to present a fully 
‘Heideggerian’  or fully ‘Aristotelian’ argument (whatever that might mean).

The  case  study  in  the  second  half of the  thesis  has  a  dual  purpose.28  While  its  main 
function  is to shed  light on the phenomenon of German-American cooperation,  it is also 
of exploratory  nature  intended  to  trace  and  refine  the  causal  pathways  of the  theory 
developed  in the first part of the thesis (Gerring 2007:  40ff). As the case  is not selected 
out of a pool of alternative cases but stimulates the task of theory building, the empirical 
analysis may seem biased  to those  subscribing to an  agenda of theory  ‘testing’  (George 
and Bennett 2004:  22ff.).  Yet for the purpose of creative theorizing this is not a problem 
at  all.  Indeed,  the  ‘bias’  is  inevitable,  as  instead  of collecting  empirical  data  for  the 
purpose  of  validation  or  refutation,  the  phenomenon  of  German-American  relations 
serves as both  inspiration and  playground for the new theoretical  frame developed here. 
That said, to avoid the false  impression that the theory is tailored towards  ‘the case’, the 
theoretical  discussion  proceeds  in  general terms without reference to German-American 
relations and remains strictly separate from the case study.

Methodological Issues
The  empirical  study  employs what  may  be  broadly  called  an  interpretative  approach.29 
This is due to the theory’s phenomenological focus on ontology, more specifically on  its 
emphasis  on  intersubjectively  created  structures  of meaning  and  their  function  in  the 
constitution  of the  state  as  a  biographical  narrative.  Of course,  all  empirical  analysis 
involves  some  sort  of  interpretation  in  some  sense  of the  word.  Yet  as  opposed  to  a 
‘rationalist’  approach  which,  in Keohane’s (1998) understanding of the term, assumes a 
reality in which the identities and interests of states (actors) are exogenously given/fixed,

28 On  the problem  of defining  ‘case  study’  and the  multiple meanings that have been  subsumed 
under this term, see Gerring (2007, Ch. 2).
29  See,  for  instance,  Yanow  and  Schwartz-Shea (2006);  Lebow  and  Lichbach  (2007).  Note  that

an interpretative approach  is tailored towards investigating the reality states construct for 
themselves and discerning the reasons (goals, motives) driving their behaviour.  Such  an 
approach  is non-positivist  in orientation  because  it denies the existence of a meaningful 
reality independent of conceptual frames employed by humans and, consequently, holds 
that theory cannot be  ‘tested  against’  such  a reality.  Hence,  to the  dismay of positivist- 
schooled  analysts  such  as  Moravcsik  (1999),  an  interpretative  approach  cannot  outline 
what  kind  of evidence  would  prove  the  theory  ‘wrong’  and,  hence,  cannot  provide  a 
falsifiable hypothesis.30  Instead,  it asks for a hermeneutical  method (Kratochwil,  2000b; 
Tickner, 2005; Pouliot, 2007).31

Rather  than  opening  the  door  to  ‘anything  goes’,  an  interpretative  approach  is  not 
relieved from the task of saying what makes the story generated thereby persuasive.  For 
this,  the  analyst must address  a number of challenges revolving around  the  overarching 
question  of  how  to  “interpret  an  already  interpreted  world”  (Guzzini  2000:  148). 
Grasping  how  actors  interpret  their  world  is  challenging  because  it  requires  analyzing 
the  influence of ideas or  ‘worldviews’.32  The  question  how  ideas and  values  can  shown 
to  be  formative  forces  opens  up  the  ‘problem  of other  minds’  well  familiar  to  social 
scientists and philosophers.33 There are three ways to address this problem.

The  first  would  be  to  show  that  ‘material’  factors  do  not  sufficiently  explain  the 
observed  behaviour/phenomenon,  thus  narrowing  the  focus  onto  ideas  by  excluding 
alternative  explanations.  However,  apart  from  the  fact  that  such  negative  proof only 
delays  addressing  the  ‘problem  of  other  minds’,  an  approach  emphasizing  that  the 
material  world  is  interpreted through  ideas  actually cannot  pitch  ideational  and material 
factors against each other.  Second,  leaving aside that one may not be consciously aware 
of ones’  worldviews  and/or  is  unable  to  share  them,  they  may  be  expressed  and,  in  a 
sense,  ‘materialize’  through  some  sort of symbolic  medium,  most commonly  language. 
Yet  sceptics  will  always  hold  that  ‘talk  is  cheap’  and  that  there  is  ho  way  to  tell  if 
someone  actually  means  what  (s)he  says.  Hence,  third,  recording  the  understanding 
actors have of themselves and what the world means to them must be approached with a 
broader analytical net which allows to evaluate and sort these meanings by putting them

30 For a view that an interpretative approach should accommodate the principle of ‘falsification’, 
see Hopf (2007), also Wendt (1999).
31  Hopf  (2007:  63)  differentiates  between  phenomenological,  interpretive  and  hermeneutical 
approaches.
32 To be sure, the analysis of ideas is not reserved for ‘non-positivist’  approaches; yet positivists 
are more reluctant to engage it as the problem of knowing what is in other people’s heads makes 
a hypothesis testing approach rather difficult.

‘into perspective’. As Ted Hopf puts it “the meaning of an  individual’s action and words 
are  not  his  to  control  or  interpret”  but  must be  “surfaced  by  the  observer”  (Hopf 2007: 
62f.).34  In  other  words,  the  analyst  is  both  observer  and  interpreter  analyzing  state 
behaviour  from  ‘within’  while  maintaining  the  broader  view  from  ‘without’.  This  not 
only  requires  empathy  to  see  the  world  from  the  perspective  of the  research  ‘object’ 
(rather:  subject),  ideally as a participant-observer (Klotz and Lynch 2007:  37),35 but also 
reflexivity on the side of the analyst to allow awareness of its own biases when engaging 
this task (Guzzini 2000; Tickner 2005).

When  it  comes  to  specifying  this  broader  analytical  net  which  allows  evaluating  the 
evidence  from  a  distance  and  placing  it  into  ‘perspective’,  constructivists  like  to  stress 
the social structure and the historical trajectory actors are situated in (Pouliot 2007; Hopf 
2007).  It builds  on  the view that meaning is  constructed  not  in  isolation  but  in  a  social 
setting  and  thereby  turns  into  a  ‘social  fact’  situated  between  and  across  the  minds  of 
individuals  and  visible  in  social  practice.  Moreover,  because  the  construction  of social 
reality  is  a temporal  process,  discerning and  making intelligible  social  facts  involves an 
evolutionary  and,  hence,  historical  perspective:  “historicity...shows  up  as  part  of the 
contexts that  make  possible  social  reality”  (Adler 2002:  102).  Vincent  Pouliot’s  (2007: 
367)  suggestion  that  contextualization  and  historicity  ‘objectify’  knowledge  because 
they  require  the  analyst  to  ‘stand  back’  from  and  go  beyond  purely  subjective  and 
current  meanings  is  useful  for  gaining  perspective,  but  not  sufficient  as  they  do  not 
provide  the  analyst  with  guidance  on  which  context  and  which  history  matters  (and 
why).  As  noted  earlier and discussed  in  more detail  in the next chapter, the net offering 
such guidance must be spun by theory.

in  a  systematic  and 
Theoretical  guidance  allows  engaging  the  historical  case 
discriminatory fashion through a “structured,  focused comparison” (George and  Bennett 
2004, Ch.  3) where the same sub-questions are “asked of each case under study to guide 
and  standardize  data collection”  and with the  analyst dealing “only with  certain  aspects 
of  the  historical  cases  examined”  (George  and  Bennett  2004:  67).  Even  though  the 
phenomenon  at  hand  is  a  ‘single’  case  in  that  the  three  periods  form  one  overarching 
dynamic of (non)cooperation,  it nevertheless  carries  a comparative element through the

34 Hopf also speaks of an act of ‘translation’.
35 As Guzzini puts it, using Bourdieusian terminology, “identity (agency), interests and strategies 
are  field-specific  and  can  be  understood  only  after a prior  analysis  of the  field  itself’  (Guzzini 
2000:  166).

25

connection.36  More  precisely,  the  empirical  analysis  is  structured  in  that  each  period 
addresses  the  same  set  of  questions,  assessing  the  government’s  conception  of 
Germany’s  national  biography,  how  it  connects  with  the  US  narrative  through  a  vision 
of European  order,  and  what  implication this  has for common  institutional  investments. 
And  it is focused in that the examination of these periods  is tailored towards carving out 
only those parameters central to the theoretical argument and  brackets other issues, such 
the  relationship  of Bonn  and  Washington  with  Moscow.  Slightly  out  of focus  but  still 
present  are  the  roles  played  by  Britain  and  France  in  the  process  of  setting  up  the 
institutional structures of NATO, CSCE, and CFSP.

On  the  question  of what  counts  as  evidence,  two  cautionary  notes  are  in  order.  First, 
ideally a case  study draws on  a variety of sources and,  in particular,  on  primary sources 
gained  through  careful  archival  work  (historical  analysis  obviously  does  not  allow  a 
participant-observation  approach).  This  thesis  does  not  quite  fulfil  that  ideal.  While 
occasionally  the  empirical  narrative  is  backed  through  the  study  of personal  accounts, 
speeches and treaties,  it relies mainly on  secondary  literature.  This  is justified  by (i) the 
focus on theory development, (ii) the temporal scope of the analysis and  by (iii) the fact 
that  the  analysis  gains  its  explanatory  power  through  the  theoretical  argument.37  That 
said,  one  problem  remains with  ‘second  order’  interpretation:  If all  secondary  literature 
is  written  from  a  perspective,  the  empirical  narrative  may  rely  on  evidence taken  from 
work whose interpretations do not coincide with the angle taken here.  Said differently,  it 
runs  the  risk  of  ‘cherry  picking’  evidence  from  studies  whose  argumentative  thrust  is 
different  from,  perhaps  even  in  conflict  with,  the  argument  presented  here.38  While 
ideally  one  would  point  out  the  differences  and  clarity  contrasting  angles  wherever 
possible,  given  the  vast  amount  of studies  done  on  German-American  relations  laying 
out all the instances where my interpretation diverges from the studies referenced  in this 
thesis  would  require  more  space  and  disrupt the  flow  of the  narrative.  Hence,  I  merely

36  In Gerring’s terminology, the  case  study  presented here  is a diachronic single-case study, that 
is, it analyses a single case which contains internal temporal variation (Gerring 2007: 28).
37  Relying  on  secondary  sources  is  common  practice  among  social  scientists  working  with  a 
broad  historical  horizon.  As  Theda  Skocpol  notes  “If  a  topic  is  too  big  for  purely  primary 
research  -   and  if  excellent  studies  by  specialists  are  already  available  in  some  profusion  -  
secondary sources are  appropriate as the basic source of evidence for a given  study.  Using them 
is not different from  survey analysts reworking the results of previous surveys rather than  asking 
all questions anew” (in Goldthorpe  1991: 224). For a critique, see Goldthorpe (1991).
38  On  this  problem,  see  Goldthorpe  (1991);  Hall  and  Kratochwil  (1993);  Lustick  (1996);  also 
Elman  and  Fendius  Elman  (1997).  The  criticism  that  many  social  scientists  taking  a  (macro) 
historical perspective tend not to follow any  substantial rules but “enjoy a delightful  freedom to 
play  ‘p'ck-and-mix’  in  history’s  sweetshop”  (Goldthorpe  1991:  225)  is  well  taken  but does  not 
acknowledge the value of theoretical guidance.

signal  awareness of the problem without offering a solution  other than  my commitment 
to minimize misrepresentation.

Finally,  coming  up  with  a  new/original  theoretical  angle  faces  a  semantic  challenge, 
namely that  one  has  to  be  careful  with  using  established  terms  like  the  state,  security, 
power,  etc.,  as  their  meaning  is  always  tied  to  a  broader  theoretical  frame.  As  Waltz 
points  out,  changes  of theory  produce  changes  in  the  meaning  of terms  and  so  it  is 
necessary to  clarify the vocabulary  used  and  redefine  basic  concepts  (Waltz  1979:  12). 
This  concerns,  in  particular,  the  meaning  of security  policy,  which  for  most  scholars 
writing  during  or  about  the  Cold  War  concerns  strategic-military  issues.  Rather  than 
engaging  this  kind  of thinking,  the  thesis  contrasts  the  view  that  German-American 
security  cooperation  was  based  primarily  on  a  military  rationale,  namely  deterring  a 
Soviet  attack,  and  instead  strengthens  the  view  that  throughout  “Bonn’s  demand  for 
security was primarily political in nature” (Doering-Manteuffel  1983:  52).

Overview of C hapters
The  thesis  is  divided  in  two  major  parts,  a  theoretical  one  (chapters  2  to  7)  and  an 
empirical  one  (chapters  8  to  10).  Following  this  introduction,  the  theoretical  part  is 
subdivided  into three  sections:  the  first section  prepares the  meta-theoretical  ground  for 
‘creative  theorizing’  and  engages  the  task  via  an  engagement  of the  three  existing  IR 
paradigms (chapters  2  and  3).  The  second  section  draws  on  Heidegger for a  reading of 
what  ‘drives’  humans  and  subsequently  offers  a  reconceptualization  of the  state  as  a 
national  biography  (chapters  4  and  5),  and  the  section  third  presents  a  reading  of the 
dynamics  of 
and 
‘estrangement/emancipation’  (chapters  6  and  7).  The  empirical  part  is  also  divided  in 
three  sections,  each  illuminating  one  decade  of German-American  cooperation,  with  a 
focus on Adenauer’s  decision to  invest in NATO  in the decade following the end of the 
Second  World  War  (chapter  8),  followed  by  Brandt’s  decision  to  invest  in  CSCE 
(chapter  9)  and,  finally,  the  move of the  Kohl  government towards  CFSP  (chapter  10). 
The  conclusion  reviews the  major  findings  and  offers  some thoughts  on  the theoretical 
and empirical  implications.

Turning  to  the  content  of  individual  chapters,  C hapter  Two  outlines  the  basic 
parameters  of  and  provides  a  roadmap  for  ‘creative  theorizing’.  It  argues  that  a 
persuasive  argument  requires  a  strong theoretical  foundation  and  reviews  the  positions 
of Kuhn,  Popper,  and  Lakatos  to  adopt  the  latters’  notion  of a  ‘research  programme’ 
revolving  around  a  ‘hard  core’  and  the  notion  that  a  new  theory  is  ‘better’  if  it  can

27

produce and accommodating ‘novel facts’. Noting that Lakatos remains vague about the 
use  of these  terms  and  does  not  say  much  about  the  task  of theory  development,  the 
discussion  justifies  a  deductive  approach  and  suggests  that  the  intellectual  space  for 
theory building is opened via an exploration of the theoretical  limits of existing theories 
(‘unravelling’). The remainder of the chapter specifies the nature of a  ‘deep theoiy’  and 
suggests  that  it  involves  tracing  the  causal  narrative  of a  theory  to  an  account  of the 
human  condition  defining  the  spatio-temporal  situatedness  of  the  state.  The  chapter 
closes  by  showing  how  such  an  account  operates  on  the  level  of ontology  and  gives 
meaning  to  the  ‘national  security  interest’  via  an  understanding  of statehood  and  the 
corresponding ‘existential threat’ to the same.

C hapter  Three  unravels  the  three  major  ‘paradigms’  -   realism,  institutionalism,  and 
constructivism -  to (i) reveal both internal tensions and explore why they do not provide 
a  convincing  causal  narrative  for  the  phenomenon  at  hand,  and  to  (ii)  use  them  as  a 
source  of inspiration  for  ‘creative  theorizing’,  that  is,  to  learn  from  their  insights  and 
limits. The chapter first traces realism’s ‘balance of power’  proposition to the Hobbesian 
account  of the  human  condition  emphasizing  territorial  integrity  (autonomy)  as  what 
makes  ‘the  state’.  The  discussion  notes  the  conceptual  void  of realism  on  the  question 
why states seek autonomy and highlights that realists locate the existential threat in time, 
addressing future  uncertainty  by  reverting to  worst-case thinking  rooted  in  a reading of 
history  as  conflictual.  The  chapter  then  briefly  discusses  the  institutionalist  paradigm, 
divided  into  historical  institutionalism  and  neoliberal  (or  utilitarian)  institutionalism,  to 
show that both versions  are unsuitable for making sense of the case at hand due to their 
path  dependency  bias.  While 
interesting 
modifications  to  the  reading  of  the  spatiality  of  interstate  relations,  it  is  noted  that 
institutionalisms’  conception of the  state remains grounded  in the realist hard  core.  The 
final  part  of the  chapter  engages  the  constructivist  paradigm.  Differentiating  between 
moderate and radical constructivism, it discusses the formers’ conceptualization of ‘state 
identity’  and criticizes it for (i) failing to come up with a notion of the  ‘state’  alternative 
to  realism  and  (ii)  for  its  overemphasis  on  socialization,  i.e.  a  progressive  dynamic 
which  cannot  account  for  a  breakdown  of relations  as  it  lacks  a  conceptualisation  of 
threat to  ‘identity’. This weakness is attributed to the constructivist attempt to overcome 
realism  without  grounding  constructivism  in  a  new  account  of the  human  condition 
(spatio-temporal situatedness of the state).

C hapter  Four  relies  on  Heidegger  to  argue  that  humans  are  driven  by  the  desire  to 
control  anxiety.  It  takes  the  postmodern  emphasis  on  identity  and  contingency  as  a

28

starting  point  and  engages  Heidegger’s  fundamental  ontology to  open  up  new  ways  of 
conceptualizing  ‘the  S elf  and  its  basic  interest.  It picks  up  Heidegger’s  argument that 
being-in-the-world  is  conditioned  by  awareness  of finitude  yet  impossibility  to  know 
death,  which  generates  ‘anxiety’  as  the  foundational  sentiment.  This  provides  an 
alternative to Hobbesian ontology by shifting attention to the Selfs attempt of coming to 
terms with anxiety by seeking orientation through meaningful  ‘knowledge’  of itself and 
‘the world’.  It is shown how the reflexive ability of the  Self generates what is termed an 
‘anxiety  paradox’,  namely  the  attempt  to  regain  a  sense  of continuity/stability  which 
denies  contingency  of  being  and  carries  the  Self  beyond  ‘death’.  Two  strategies, 
mathematical  measuring and  routine  practices,  are  criticized  with  Heidegger for failing 
to  provide  the  Self with  ‘authenticity’,  generating  an  ‘anxiety  dilemma’.  The  chapter 
argues  that  the  paradox  does  not  need  to  end  in  a  dilemma  if  past  and  future  are 
conceptualized  as  meaningful  places  for  the  Self providing  substance  to  a  narrative  of 
‘authentic becoming’.

space  and 

into  being-in-the-world 

Chapter Five discusses how the Self establishes a meaningful existence -  a narrative of 
authentic  becoming  -   through  a  ‘national  biography’,  that  is,  a  coherent  life  story  of 
coming 
time.  Maintaining  Heidegger’s 
phenomenological  perspective,  the  chapter  first  discusses  the  spatial  embeddedness  of 
being-in-the-world through the notion  of an experienced  space.  It suggests to  grasp this 
through  a  taxonomy  of  centre/soul,  valued  order,  and  horizon  to  then  explore  the 
usefulness of existing frameworks in IR for conceptualizing the states’  situatedness in an 
‘experienced  space’.  The  second  half of the  chapter  discusses  the  temporal  features  of 
the  national  biography.  It  highlights  the  importance  of  memory  spaces  generated  by 
significant  experiences  rendering  the  past  meaningful,  whose  ambiguity  provide  the 
creative  space to  devise  lessons  projected  into the  future  as  visions  of order,  or utopias 
and  devising an  ‘envisioned  space’.  It argues that  in merging the two the  Self turns  ‘its’ 
world  into  a  meaningful  project  through  a  coherent  biography,  which  is  the  site  of 
political agency and provides political leaders with direction.

C hapter Six argues that states attempt to create a meaningful world through friendship. 
After reviewing the limits of Heidegger’s ontology as one in which authenticity does not 
(cannot)  arise  out  of  social  relations,  it  argues  that  the  Self  is  looking  to  realize  its 
project with  significant  Others,  or  ‘friends’  as  a way to maintain  authenticity within  an 
intimate  relationship.  It  shows  how  IR  scholarship  has  neglected  looking  at  intimate 
relations as stabilizing the Self by either focusing on the negative Other (‘the enemy’) or 
vague notions of group  membership (‘community’). The discussion takes up Aristotle’s

29

notion  of  true  friendship  and  focuses  on  the  features  of  reciprocity  and  equality 
established through moral particularity to define friendship between  states arising out of 
a  convergence  of national  biographies.  It  argues  that  friends  unfold  through  a  shared 
experienced  space and negotiate common visions (horizons of expectations) and thereby 
order an  ‘inter-subjective’  world  in  which  biographical  narratives  resonate but are  also, 
inevitably,  compromised. Establishing friendship  as  a creative  project which  empowers 
both  sides,  it  is argued that this project  is  pursued through  common  institutions as  sites 
for negotiating visions of order,  serving friends  as  political  platforms for shared world- 
building.

C hapter  Seven  argues  that  states  invest  in  a  new/alternative  institution  if  their 
friendship  undergoes  a  process  of  sustained  dissonance,  or  estrangement.  More
precisely,  it argues that states do so when the existing institutional arrangement ceases to 
function  as an  anxiety controlling mechanism, that  is,  when  it ceases to  be the  platform 
through  which  a  coherent  national  biography  can  be  negotiated  with  the  friend.  This 
argument  is  made  by  suggesting  that  the  existential  threat  to  a  stable  sense  of Self is 
posed  by  ambivalence produced  by  dissonance  among friends  over  ideas  of order,  that 
is,  different  readings  of the  common  project  and  adequate  contribution  to  the  same. 
Enduring  dissonance,  it  is  argued,  leads  to  a  process  of ‘estrangement’  among  friends. 
Two  possible  reactions  are  discussed:  ‘adaptation’  and  ‘emancipation’.  Whereas  the 
former  refers  to  the  attempt  to  renegotiate  ideas  of order  with  the  friend  through  the 
common  institution,  an  enduring  dissonance  which  violates  authentic  ideas  of  order 
leads  states to pursue a strategy of emancipation.  Such  a strategy  involves  searching for 
an  alternative  significant Other with whom  a  ‘world  building’  project can be negotiated 
through  a  new  institution  which  better  accommodates  the  national  biography.  The 
chapter concludes with outlining what to expect from the empirical analysis.

C hapter  Eight  applies  the  theoretical  lens  established  in  the  previous  chapters  to 
explain  German  and  American  investment in NATO  in  the  decade following the end  of 
the  Second  World  War  (1945-55)  with  overlapping  narratives  of  being-in-the-world, 
creating  binds  of  friendship.  The  first  part  lays  out  how  Adenauer  sought  to  give 
‘Germany’  a  new  direction  after  the  end  of  the  war.  He  did  so  by  formulating  the 
narrative  of  Germany-in-Europe  emphasizing 
‘liberalism’  and 
‘antimilitarism’  in  overlap  with  the  American  narrative  and  anchored  in  the  Western 
space.  The  second  part  shows  how  this  narrative  resonated  with  the  Truman  and 
Churchill  administrations  in  their  attempt  of  making  sense  of  the  US  presence  in 
‘Europe’  by  building  a  ‘United  States  of  Europe’  through  NATO.  The  third  part

as  an  attempt  by  Adenauer  to  secure  German  voice  in  the  Western  project  through 
NATO  membership.  It  is  shown  how  this  occurred  with  the  help  of a  dystopia  of a 
communist  Europe  captured  in  the  ‘Korea  model’  and  the  ‘Prague  model’,  further 
manifesting German-American commitment to shared ideal of European order.

C hapter  Nine  explores  Willy  Brandt’s  motivation  to  invest  in  (what  became)  CSCE 
between  1965  and  1975  and  the  American  reluctance  to join  this  institution.  It  argues 
that  Brandt  envisioned  ‘Germany’  unfolding  into  a  Greater European  Peace  Order  in  a 
way  that  could  not  be  done  through NATO  and that this  raised  suspicion  in  the  US.  It 
first shows how his  idea to build a Germany in  ‘Greater Europe’  through  Ostpolitik was 
formulated  with  ‘Kennedy-America’  and  that  this  creative  relationship  stalled  with  the 
Johnson  and,  particularly, the Nixon  administration.  Dissonance  emerged between  their 
narratives  of Germany  and  America  in  the  world  over the  vision  of ‘peace  in  Europe’: 
whereas from  Washington  it meant stability  in the  ‘order of Yalta’,  from  Berlin/Bonn  it 
meant change and overcoming this very order. The chapter shows that while the ‘Harmel 
report’  and  the  ambiguous  meaning  of  detente  allowed  the  Brandt  government  to 
formally  pursue  his  vision 
it  considered  a  European  Security 
Conference  (later  CSCE)  the  more  suitable  forum  for  building  ‘Germany-in-Greater- 
Europe’.  It discusses Nixon/Kissinger’s  unease with Brandt’s course  because  it brought 
uncertainty into America’s conception of ‘Europe’  and, hence,  ‘the world’, prompting a 
US  strategy  to  keep  Brandt  close  through  NATO.  Both  sides  concealed  their  tensions 
over  the  shared  project  through  a  strategy  of  silence  and  Nixon/Kissinger’s  low-key 
participation in CSCE.

C hapter  Ten  discusses  how  the  Kohl  government  came  to  invest  in  CFSP  as  a  new 
forum  and  potential  alternative to NATO and  CSCE to  manifest  its vision  of Germany- 
in-Europe.  It addresses the divergence  in  German-American  security cooperation  in  the 
decade  between  1985  and  1995,  when  Bonn  came  to  invest  in  WEU/CFSP  as  an 
alternative  to  NATO  and  CSCE.  The  first  part  lays  out  the  orientation  of  the 
Kohl/Genscher  government  as  a  merger  of  Adenauer’s  and  Brandt’s  narrative  of 
‘Germany-in-Europe’  and  points  out  the  tensions  with  the  Reagan  administration.  The 
second  part  examines the  ‘Bonn-Washington  nexus’  during  the  negotiations  leading to 
German unification to suggest that it blended out dissonance about the broader question 
of  the  Western  project  after  the  end  of  the  Cold  War.  The  third  part  discusses 
disagreements about the meaning of the  1991  Gulf War and the conflict in Bosnia for the 
‘Western’  project,  exposing  German  resistance  to  building  a  ‘New  World  Order’  with

31

military  force  and  the  lacking  American  commitment  to  invest  in  a  ‘European  Peace 
Order’. The chapter suggests that over the entire decade an enduring dissonance between 
German  and  American narratives of being-in-the-world  prompted the  Kohl  government 
to pursue a strategy of emancipation through WEU/CFSP and with France.

C hapter Eleven  concludes by  summarizing the  main theoretical  and  empirical  insights 
and  assesses  the  implications  for  IR theory  as  well  as  German-American  relations  and, 
by extension, the institutionalization o f ‘European security’.

CHAPTER TWO: THE CASE FOR ‘DEEP THEORY’

Summary
This  chapter  lays  the  groundwork  for  creative  theorizing.  It  has  two  purposes.  First,  it 
manifests  the  importance  of theoretically-guided  research  and  makes a  case  for what  is 
called  ‘deep  theory’.  Laying  out  its  features,  the  chapter  argues  that  causal  narratives 
start not merely with an assumption of state  interests but that the  latter is anchored  in an 
ontology of the state which,  in turn,  is embedded in an account of the human condition, 
that  is,  in  an  account of spatial  and temporal  situatedness.  Second, the chapter suggests 
that  a  deep  engagement  with  theory  is  central  to  creative  theorizing.  It  allows  to 
‘unravel’  existing IR theories from within not only to  lay out why they are unsuitable to 
make sense of the phenomenon at hand but also,  and perhaps even more so, to use their 
internal tensions and shortcomings as a stimulus for building a new theoretical frame.

The discussion  developing these  points  proceeds  as  follows:  It begins  by  laying out the 
difference  between  shallow  and  deep  theorizing.  In  an  attempt  to  specify  the  latter,  it 
then  briefly  reviews  the  debate  between  Kuhn,  Popper  and  Lakatos,  adopting  Lakatos 
concept of the  ‘hard  core’  and  his  emphasis on  the  need  for constructive criticism.  The 
chapter proceeds  by  making the  case  for  ‘creative theorizing’  as  a  deductive  enterprise 
involving the ‘unraveling’ of existing approaches and searching for conceptual openings. 
It  then  presents  a  reading  of the  ‘hard  core’  of a  theory  as  an  account  of the  human 
condition  (as  opposed  to  human  nature)  in  which  the  meaning  of the  state  and  of  its 
‘national  security  interest’  is  embedded.  The  final  section justifies  this  ‘deep’  approach 
with the  ‘survival’  assumption  popular  in  IR,  pointing out that  knowing what  it  means 
for states to ‘survive’ requires an account of what it means for the state to ‘be’.

The Interpretative Bias
All  research  must  come  to  terms  with  the  interpretative  bias,  namely  that  conceptual 
frames interfere both when delineating the phenomenon and  in the subsequent enterprise 
of making sense  of it.  Although  the  ambition  to  present  an  accurate  picture  of the  past 
necessarily  pervades  the  work  of  historians,  since  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century 
scholars have come to admit that the historical  ‘record’  does not speak for itself. As E.H. 
Carr  noted,  ‘facts’  are  not  passively  received  but  emerge  out  of a  continuous  dialogue 
between  present  and  past  (Carr,  1990  (1961):  21-30;  Spence,  1982).  In  this  dialogue, 
which  for  those  aiming  at  prediction  also  includes  the  future,  theory  plays  the  crucial 
role  of  categorizing  and  ordering  the  ‘record’.  Hans  Morgenthau,  who  believed  that

33

there  was  an  ‘’’intrinsic  nature”  of international  politics  and  in  the  ability  of theory  to 
capture the  same “as  it actually  is”  (Morgenthau  1960:  15),  saw theory  function “like  a 
skeleton  which,  invisible  from  the  naked  eye,  gives  form  and  function  to  the  body  [of 
history]”  (in  Thompson,  1960:  18).  Yet  it  is  not  only  that theory  tells  us  which  ‘facts’ 
matter and which do not. Even more so, when  ‘facts’  are selected,  interpreted, and filled 
with  meaning they  also  become  the  analyst’s  creation.  In  other  words,  the  angle  from 
which  events  are  observed  and  attributed  with  meaning  -   historians  would  say 
‘represented’  -  also  relies  on  an  idea  of how  they  matter.  As  Weber noted,  “we cannot 
learn the meaning of the world from the  result of its analysis, be  it ever so perfect;  [we] 
must rather be in a position to create this meaning itself’ (in Smith,  1999:  23).

The  theoretical  lenses  providing  this  meaning  in  turn  are  products/grow  out  of  real- 
world  concerns  and  experiences  (Sabine,  1969  (1931);  Cox,  1981;  Puchala,  2003).39 
Theories arise out of and respond to a very  ‘real’  socio-political context, motivated by a 
certain  Erkenntnisinteresse,  a  Kantian  term 
literally  translated  as  the  interest  in 
knowledge/insight and echoed in Robert Cox’s (1981:  128) famous statement that theory 
is always for someone and for some purpose.40 As George Sabine put it, there is no such 
thing as a disinterested political theory. In addition to a causal narrative, theories always 
contain  ‘factual’  and  ‘valuational’  properties emerging out of the author’s socio-political 
context and normative agenda, respectively (Sabine,  1969:  11).41

If theoretical  lenses and the reading of history are intertwined  in this way and constitute 
each  other,  then  the  persuasiveness  of an  argument,  its  “narrative truth”  (Spence  1982) 
depends  on  how  the 
interaction  between  theory  and  history  is  managed.42  This 
interaction  is  central  to  the  debate  between  positivism  and  its  critics,  what  Gabriel 
Almond  (1988:  839)  called  the  “hard  science  -   soft  science’  polarity  endemic  to  the

39 Gaddis notes how the debate among historians in the  late  1960s about the origins of the Cold 
War was “a dialogue thinly concealed by the fact that what many of the participants were really 
arguing about,  and using history to  support their respective  positions,  was  the  war  in  Vietnam” 
(Gaddis,  1987:  12).
40 For how personal experiences influence theorizing in feminism, see Tickner (2005).
41  Cox’s  (1981)  famous  distinction  between  ‘problem-solving’  and  ‘critical’  theories  is  overly 
crude  as  it  does  not  capture  theories  aimed  at  explaining  without  ascribing  to  a  positivist 
‘problem-solving’  approach.  German theorists have classified theories in  up to  four types aimed 
at  searching  for  the  good  life  (normative),  creating  intersubjective  understanding  (historical- 
hermeneutic),  prediction  (empiric-analytic),  and  emancipation  (critical-dialectic),  respectively 
(Habermas  1986; von Beyme  1992). While useful for textbook-classification, a substantial theory 
cannot escape either dimension.

discipline  [of political  science]  since  its  origins”.43  While  the  scale  characterized  by 
poles  of ‘soft’  and  ‘hard’  may  be  useful  for  debating  types/kinds  of science,  it  is  less 
useful  for  the  task  of grasping  different  understandings  of theory  aimed  at  organizing 
‘history’  and,  thus,  lending  meaning  to  the  world.  The  scale  for  the  latter  purpose,  I 
suggest,  is  one  that  ranges  between  deep  (or  thick)  and  shallow  (or  thin)  theorizing. 
Although both capture different ways of dealing with the theory-history relationship, the 
difference  is not semantic:  whereas the  ‘soft/hard’  distinction  is  more about the method 
chosen  (quantitative  versus  interpretative,  crudely  put),  the  ‘deep/shallow’  distinction 
captures whether the persuasiveness of an argument relies primarily (not exclusively) on 
philosophical  depth  or  on  empirical  evidence.  One  could  say  the  two  draw  different 
conclusions from the Humean  insight that causality can never be truly experienced but is 
something that  is  formed and  exists  in the mind:  while the  ‘hard/soft’  pair assumes that 
causality  can  be  ‘inferred’  through  observation  of  regular  patterns  or  through  thick 
description,  the  deep/shallow  pair captures  how much  weight the  causal  argument  puts 
on theory. The question is what makes a theory ‘deep’?

is  “whatever  philosophers 
When  Sabine  (1969:  8)  notes 
have...called  by  that  name”  he  suggests  that  theorising  is  the  domain  of philosophers. 
While  in  the  field  of IR there  may  not  be  many  claiming (or  accepting)  this  title  there 
clearly are  some who theorize  more carefully  and  ‘deeper’  than  others.  John  Vasquez’s
(1995)  point  that  not  everything  that  calls  itself such  is  a  theory  echoes  a  complaint 
voiced by the  likes of Raymond Aron  (1967) and Kenneth  Waltz (1979),  both  of whom 
noted  that  ‘theory’  is  an  over-used  and  abused  term  among  scholars  of  international 
politics.  Symptomatic  are  sweeping  statements  such  as  Donald  Puchala’s  (2003:  5) 
characterization  of theory  as  “an  intellectual  treasure  trove  of Weberian  ideal  types  of 
phenomena,  structures,  processes,  causes,  effects,  and  outcomes”  and  leaving  it at that. 
More  recently,  David  Boucher  suggested 
the 
opportunity  of firmly  anchoring  itself on  sound  philosophical  foundations”  (Boucher, 
1998:  4).  While this  latter assessment may go  a bit too  far -  certainly  according to the 
criteria  outlined  in  this  chapter  there  are  philosophically  grounded  IR  theories  -   it 
highlights  an  important  issue.  As  Scott  Burchill  notes,  and  a  look  at  IR  textbooks 
confirms,  the  plurality  of views  in  an  increasingly  ‘fragmented’  discipline  about  the

German  sociology and  still  resonates  in  the  distinction  between  rational-choice and postmodern 
frameworks in  IR.  For a discussion  of the  latter,  see  Lapid (1989);  Vasquez (1995);  Smith  et al. 
(1996); Mayer (2003).

purpose  and  character  of ‘theory’  has  created  a  situation  where  scholars  “do  not agree 
about  what  they  are  actually  doing  when  they  theorize  about  international  relations” 
(Burchill,  2001:  8,  emphasis  added).44  In  short,  while  much  energy  has  been  spent  on 
discussing  what  makes  a  theory  of  international politics',  few  have  focussed  on  the 
question what makes a theory.45

Looking at Lakatos
In  approaching this question  and clarifying the  meaning of ‘deep theory’,  it  is  useful to 
briefly review the debate between Thomas Kuhn (1996  [1962]), Karl Popper (1968), and 
Imre  Lakatos  (1970).  Although  focusing on  the  question  of how to evaluate theoretical 
progress  in  the  hard  sciences,  they  are  frequently  invoked  by  IR  scholars46  as  their 
arguments  are  sufficiently  metaphysical  to  inspire  questions  of theorising  in  the  social 
sciences.

Kuhn argues that the history of science is best understood as a succession of overarching 
‘paradigms’, socio-psychological constructs defining ‘normal science’  in theoretical and 
methodological terms for an entire scholarly community. According to Kuhn, paradigms 
cannot  be  objectively  compared,  that  is,  they  are  “incommensurable”.  Indeed,  scholars 
situated  within  different  paradigms  cannot  even  engage  in  meaningful  debate  about 
reality because the  latter is always  interpreted  within the confines of the paradigm. As a 
consequence,  paradigms  cannot  be  effectively  criticised  from  within  and  can  only  be 
replaced  during  moments  of  perceptual  crisis,  characterized  by  the  emergence  of 
‘anomalies’  eventually  leading  to  a  ‘scientific  revolution’  in  which  one  paradigm  is 
replaced by another (Kuhn,  1996 (1962):  112ff).

Popper fundamentally disagrees with Kuhn  and argues that existing theories could -  and 
should  -   be  continuously  challenged  on  rational  grounds.  Aiming  at  establishing 
objective  criteria  of  critique  which  would  prevent  ‘ideologically  blind’  research  and

44 See, for instance, Booth and Smith (1995); Burchill et al. (2001); Dunne et al. (2007).
45 It is too easy to lay the blame only at the doorstep of the  ‘behavioural revolution’. As Boucher 
points  out,  Martin  Wight’s  differentiation  of ‘Hobbesian’,  ‘Grotian’,  and  ‘Kantian’  approaches, 
an influential counter-discourse to the positivist approach in the US and taken up by Bull (1977), 
amounts only to three descriptive  lenses rather than philosophical arguments (Boucher  1998:  4). 
Although Wight/Bull’s taxonomy is useful for pointing to different ontologies of the international 
and has  since been  further developed and  incorporated  into  more  sophisticated arguments,  most 
notably  Wendt  (1999)  and  Buzan  (2004),  the  English  School  is  a  prime  example  for  an 
‘approach’  considered  both  grand  theory  (Buzan,  2004)  and  not  theory  at  all  (Waltz,  1998). 
Tellingly,  Dunne sees the English  School as “the dominant theoretical voice”  in  Britain  but also 
notes that “it needs a more rigorous account of exactly what is meant by ‘theory’” (Dunne, 2007: 
128,  130).
46 As Colin Wight (2002) points out most IR scholars merely pay lip service to these authors.

36

allow (the  monitoring of)  progress,  Poppers’  solution to the  interpretative dilemma was 
logical  positivism, namely that theories  needed to produce  propositions which  could  be 
‘falsified’  by  stating  clearly  what  evidence  would  be  needed  to  ‘disprove’ 
the 
proposition.  Although  he  knew that,  ultimately, theories cannot be  falsified  in the  strict 
sense  as  no  conclusive disproof can  ever be  produced  empirically,  he  saw the  principle 
as a critical check on ‘intellectual honesty’ (Popper,  1968).47

The  weakness  of both  Kuhn  and  Popper  is that,  for different  reasons,  their debate  does 
not contribute  much  do a deeper understanding of theory.  Kuhn’s notion  of ‘paradigm’ 
may  be  useful  to  capture  meta-theoretical  camps 
in  IR  whose  ontological  and 
epistemological  positions are  difficult to reconcile.48 Yet his definition  of ‘paradigm’  is 
notoriously  vague  and  ill  suited  to  substantiate  the  meaning  of  ‘theory’.49  Among  IR 
scholars,  at  least,  Popper’s approach  impoverished the  meaning of theory by narrowing 
it down to a causal statement, or hypothesis, thus giving rise to shallow theorizing. To be 
clear, this is not to suggest that the work of Popper is philosophically shallow but, rather, 
that  most  IR  research  adopting  a  positivist  approach  to  deal  with  the  interpretative 
dilemma reduces the meaning of theory to a hypothesis of the kind  ‘if A then B’. It leads 
to  a  conflation  of theory  and  methodology, that  is,  to  a  cherishing  of research  designs 
which place persuasive weight on empirical evidence and, as a consequence, talk theory 
but  mean  methodology  (King  et  al.  1994;  Shapiro  et  al.  2004).  The  focus  on  the 
falsification  criterion  tempted  IR  scholars  to  confuse  the  task  of  identifying  and 
specifying  meaningful  relationships  through  a  philosophically  grounded  narrative  with 
the  procedure  of ‘data collection’,  thereby overshadowing thinking about what a theory 
actually is and effectively moving the philosophical dimension, or ‘deep’  theorizing, out 
of sight.50  This  left  much  of IR  with  a  conception  of ‘theory’  treated  equal  to  formal 
modelling with falsification  as  its most important  ‘property’,  producing statements such 
as “a ‘theory’  which cannot be wrong is not a theory” (King et al.,  1994:  100).

The  ironic  consequence  of  this  shallow  understanding  of  theory  is  that  it  requires 
dismissing  one  of  the  most  important  IR  theories  dealing  with  security  cooperation,

47 As Klaus von Beyme (1992) reminds, Popper was no strict empiricist.
48  Although  it  appears  that  these  ‘paradigms’  manage  to  exist  side  by  side,  occasionally  even 
feeding  off and  modifying  each  other.  In  Kuhn’s  frame,  debate  is  necessarily  limited/artificial 
because paradigms succeed each other and, except for a brief period of overlap, do not exist side 
by side.
49 See Masterman’s (1968) critique of Kuhn’s  ‘paradigm’ -  she identifies 21  different readings -  
and Kuhn’s (1996:  174-190) attempt to clarify the concept in response.
50 Most notably,  in  King,  Keohane  and Verba, theory does not feature among the  four elements 
characterizing  “good  research”  (King  et  al.,  1994:  7f),  and  where  theory  is  discussed,  it  is 
understood as not much more than an “interrelated set of causal hypotheses” (Ibid:  99).

Waltzian  neorealism,  which  is  repeatedly  criticized  for  lacking clear  statement of what 
counts  for  ‘falsifiable’  evidence (Vasquez,  1995,  1997).  Notably, this  critique  is  readily 
accepted  by  Waltz  (1997)  as  well  as  Gilpin  who  calls  realism  “a  philosophical 
position...not  a  scientific  theory  subject  to  the  test  of falsifiability”  (Gilpin,  1996:  6). 
The  same  can  be  said  about  constructivism.  Although  some  prefer  to  call  it  a  “meta- 
theoretical  position”  instead  of a theory (Wendt  1999:  7;  Guzzini  2000),  its proponents 
generally  present  a  philosophically  grounded  argument  which,  despite  claims  to  the 
contrary,  cannot  produce  ‘falsifiable’  hypotheses,  not  the 
least  because  of  the 
constructivist  emphasis  on  norms  which  are  counterfactually  valid  (Kratochwil  and 
Ruggie,  1986:  767).51

Lakatos  provides  a  more  fruitful  roadmap.  Joining  Popper  in  criticising  Kuhn’s 
suggestion  that  scholars  are  trapped  in  paradigms,  he  saw  constant  critique  and  the 
replacement  of theories  as  both  necessary  and  possible.  More  precisely,  in  contrast  to 
Kuhn’s  view  of  scientific  revolutions  occurring  in  rather  unexpected  and  seemingly 
‘irrational’  fashion  coming from  the  outside,  Lakatos emphasises that  new theories  can 
be  put  forward  through  gradual  and  systematic  critique  also  from  the  inside.  In  his 
words,  “conceptual  frameworks  can  be  developed  and  also  replaced  by  new  ones;  it  is 
we  who  create  our prisons  and  we  can  also,  critically,  demolish them”  (Lakatos,  1970: 
104).52

Furthermore,  in  a  move  away  from  Popper,53  for  Lakatos  criticism  needs  to  be 
constructive;  there  can  be  no  falsification  before  the  emergence  of a  better  theory  as 
“refutation  without  alternatives  shows  nothing  but  the  poverty  of  our  imagination” 
(Lakatos,  1970:  120, Fn).  Instead of spending much valuable time on finding ‘falsifiable 
evidence’,  theories  should  be  evaluated  as  to  how  much  they  can  accommodate  ‘novel 
facts’.  Lakatos  suggests that one  needs  to  deploy  a  ‘pluralistic’  model  of theorizing  by 
differentiating between two types of theory,  an  interpretative one  “to  provide the facts” 
and  an .explanatory  one  to  explain  them  (Lakatos  1970:  129).  This  pluralistic  model 
forms  what  he  calls  a  ‘research  programme’  consists  of  a  succession  of  theories

51  Wendt  (1999:  373)  pays  lip  service  to  the  importance  of falsifiability  in  order  to  stay  in  the 
‘scientific’ camp. Yet as far as I am aware, Wendt never produced a falsifiable hypothesis.
52  Where  Kuhn  saw  conceptual  orthodoxy punctuated  only during rare  perceptual  crises,  Popper 
and Lakatos saw constant theoretical competition,  a “revolution  in  permanence” (Lakatos,  1970: 
92) driving forward and making possible continuous ‘growth of knowledge’.
53  In  his  key  essay,  Lakatos  tries  to  hide  his  deviation  from  Popper  by  adopting  much  of his 
language.  Yet  despite  the  semantic  parallels  such  as  naming  his  approach  “sophisticated 
methodological falsificationism” aimed at “the logic of discovery”, his argument is quite different 
to that of Popper.

38

grounded  in  a  shared  ‘hard  core’  of irrefutable  assumptions  and  “a  protective  belt  of 
auxiliary hypotheses” (Ibid,  133). While the latter can be adjusted to accommodate ‘new 
facts’,  what  Lakatos  calls  the  ‘positive  heuristics’  of  the  research  programme,  he 
emphasizes  that  protagonists  cannot  change  the  ‘hard  core’  (negative  heuristic).  From 
this  he  posits  that  the  criteria  for  evaluating  the  quality  of a  research  programme  -  
whether  it  is  progressive  or  degenerative  -   lies  in  its  ability  to  provide  ‘auxiliary 
hypotheses’  which  can  anticipate  and  adjust  to  ‘novel  facts’  (maintaining  external 
consistency)  without  loosing  connection  to  the  ‘hard  core’  (maintaining  internal 
consistency). When the  ‘hard core’  must be altered to generate and accommodate ‘novel 
facts’, it “crumbles” and the programme should be considered ‘degenerative’.

In  crude  terms,  one  could  say  the  Lakatosian  approach  is  twofold:  (1)  it  calls  for 
assessing  ‘theories’  for internal (logical) and external (empirical) consistency  in coming 
to terms with  ‘novel  facts’  and  (2)  it requires  constructive  criticism  by  holding that the 
only  valid  rejection  of existing  theories  is  the  presentation  of a  better  theory  able  to 
accommodate the  ‘novel  fact’.54  Although,  like  Kuhn  and  Popper,  Lakatos  is  primarily 
interested  in  discussing  the  possibility  of  scientific  progress,  for  the  present  purpose 
these two elements contain useful insights.

First,  his  criteria  of what  makes  a  ‘good’  theory  can  be  taken  as  conceptual  building 
blocks  of  a  ‘deep  theory’.  To  be  sure,  scholars  applying  Lakatos’  framework  have 
pointed  out that the main concepts -  the  scope of a  ‘research  programme’, the  meaning 
of a  ‘novel  fact’,  and  the  indicators  for  a  ‘progressive’  or  ‘degenerative’  programme -  
remain  unspecified  in  his  writings.55  Yet  if one  takes  Lakatos  as  an  inspiration  than  a 
blueprint,  this  does  not  necessarily  pose  a  problem  but  rather  allows  interpreting  his 
meta-theoretical  building  blocks  as  needed.  Coming  up  with  ‘novel  facts’  is  thus  read 
here not as making new predictions but,  instead, as reframing past events in a way which 
gives rise to a phenomenon not previously addressed.56 The difficulty of identifying the 
boundaries  of a  research  programme  (DiCicco  and  Levy,  2003)  is  not  much  different 
from  attempting  to  define  a  Kuhnian  paradigm  or  a  scholarly  ‘tradition’  (Williams, 
2005, Fn  15; Walker,  1993; Jeffery, 2005). Delineating a research programme inevitably 
violates the richness and complexity of individual thinkers and requires recognizing that

54  Here my reading differs  from  Vasquez (1997) who  imports a Popperian  falsifiability test into 
Lakatos  (to  criticize  Waltzian  realism),  which  is  precisely  what  Lakatos  argued  against.  See 
Elman and Elman (1997).
55  See  the  contributions  in  Elman  and  Elman  (2003)  and  the  debate  between  Vasquez  and 
(neo)realist scholars in the American Political Science Review, December  1997.

there  is  no  correct  middle  path  between  understanding  their theories  from  ‘within’,  by 
focusing  on  their  inner  logic,  and  from  ‘without’,  by  embedding  them  in  the  socio­
cultural  context  in  which  they  emerged  (Fetscher and  Muenkler  1985:  19).  A  decision 
for  the  former  requires  a  delineation  of  the  ‘hard  core’  grounding  the  research 
programme.  Similarly, whether a research programme is  ‘degenerating’  or ‘progressive’ 
depends on the question what counts as a valid adjustment of its explanatory narrative in 
accommodating the ‘novel fact’, which  in turn also relies on a clear understanding of the 
‘hard core’.

Second,  Lakatos is useful  in  insisting that the dismissal of existing theories is only valid 
if a  new  theory/research  programme  can  better  accommodate  the  ‘novel  fact’.  Yet  his 
emphasis  on  constructive  criticism  also  poses  a  great  challenge,  as  his  call  for  the 
construction  of  a  ‘new/better’  theory/research  programme  is  not  accompanied  by  a 
substantial discussion of how to do so.

The Challenge of Theory Building
Popper’s  slience  of  how  to  actually  build  a  ‘new/better’  theory  also  permeates  IR 
scholarship. Kenneth Waltz (1979) is one of the few IR theorists offering some thoughts 
on the process of theory development. Adopting Lakatos’  stance that theories can never 
be proven ‘true’  but only be overthrown by a better theory (Waltz  1979:  9), Waltz notes 
that  “theories  can  only  be  invented,  not  discovered”.  While  he  avoids  discussing  the 
process  of ‘invention’,  he  points towards  the  limits of inductive and  deductive  attempts 
to generate a theory.

The  question  whether  or  to  what  extent  ‘new  knowledge’  can  be  generated  through 
induction  (empirical  observation)  or  deduction  (logical  reflection)  has  occupied 
philosophers  for  a  long  time.  As  noted  at  the  outset  of this  chapter,  both  inevitably 
inform  our understanding  of the  world;  theory  is  always  inspired  by the  socio-political 
context  and  could  not  be  built  without  abstract  reasoning.  We  seek  inspiration  from 
‘history’  through  ‘unscientific’  impressions  from  personal  experiences  as  well  as  by 
systematically  acquiring  information,  often  second  hand,  through  careful  observation.57 
Yet the usefulness of the inductive approach meets its limits in the interpretative bias. As

57 One systematic way of doing the latter is discussed by Alexander George and Andrew Bennett 
(2004).  Yet their manual  for ‘theory development’, written  largely in juxtaposition to King et al. 
(1994), operates with a shallow understanding of theory and focuses on “procedures... conducive 
to the generation of new hypothesis”.  Moreover, while useful  in emphasizing the value of single 
case  studies  and  causal  complexity,  they  say  little  about  the  creative  process  of  case  study 
research.

40

Waltz reminds, without theory one cannot decide “which  materials to  select and  how to 
arrange  them”,  and  hence  no  inductive  procedure  can  answer  the  question  of how  to 
make  sense  of the  world  “for  the  very  problem  is  to  figure  out  the  criteria  by  which 
induction  can  usefully  proceed”  (Waltz  1979:  5).  Similarly,  Waltz  argues  that a theory 
cannot  be  created  solely  via  deduction.  He  points  out  that  this  implies  some  “initial 
premises”  and  hence  a  pre-existing  theoretical  frame  from  which  something  can  be 
deducted  yet,  according  to  Waltz,  nothing  new  can  emerge  from  deducting  out  of a 
frame already in place (Waltz  1979:  11).

If the  best  strategy  is  to  somehow  combine  inductive  and  deductive  approaches,  the 
question  is  what  this  means  in  practice.  One  example  of  the  fruitless  attempt  to 
‘discover’  a theory  of alliance  formation and  disintegration through  a mix of induction 
and deduction,  operating with a shallow understanding of theory,  is the study by Kalevi 
Holsti  and  colleagues  (Holsti  et al.  1973).  The  team  conducted  an  exhaustive  literature 
survey  from  which  it  extracted  a  large  number  of propositions  of alliance  formation, 
performance,  and  termination,  that  is,  “all  statements that  link  alliances  to  their  causes 
and  effects...irrespective  of  discipline  or  definition  of  alliance  or  coalition”.  This 
provided  them  with  347  propositions  on  the  formation  and  disintegration  of alliances, 
laid out in an appendix of almost 30 pages. These were then clustered and tested “on all 
alliances  formed  between  the  end  of the  Napoleonic  Wars  and  the  outbreak  of World 
War  II”  to  determine  “the  relative  merits  of  alternative  candidates  for  a  theory  of 
alliances”  (Holsti  et  al.,  1973:  v-vi).  The  result,  however,  is  vague  and  disappointing, 
with the authors conceding that their objective of identifying a  ‘theory’  of alliances  had 
to  be  buried  under  the  sheer  diversity  of arguments  and  angles  their  study  had  found, 
leaving them  with  not much  more than the  hope that their efforts  would  at  least “assist 
others to write a more definitive conclusion”.

The reason  Holsti  and his colleagues failed  in their task of finding a theory of alliances 
is that their approach  did not take into account what Popper knew, namely that “there  is 
no  such  thing  as  a  logical  method  of having  new  ideas”  and  that  discovery  contains  a 
“creative  intuition”  (in  King et al.,  1994:  14).  Similarly,  Waltz notes that  inductive and 
deductive  procedures  are  “indispensable”  in  the  construction  of theory  yet that  “using 
them  in combination gives rise to a theory only if a creative idea emerges” (Waltz  1979: 
11). 
and 
ordering/placing  them  in  some  sort  of relationship  to  then  throwing  them  back  at  ‘the 
world’  for  re-evaluation  plays  a  crucial  part  in  generating  theory,  somewhere  in  this 
process  there  must  be  a  creative  act  in  which  something  new  emerges.  Waltz  captures

taking  historical  observations/experiences 

In  other  words,  while 

41

this by saying that theories are “artistic creations”, that they require “creative ideas” and 
the flashing of a “brilliant intuition” (Ibid., 9), yet he also concedes that one cannot say 
much  beyond  the  fact  that  theories  are  made  ‘creatively’:  “Even  by  those  who  have 
authored  them,  the  emergence  of theories  cannot  be  described  in  other  than  uncertain 
and impressionistic ways” (Ibid.,  10).

As  sitting  around  and  waiting  for  a  creative  idea to  emerge  seems  hardly  a productive 
strategy, this thesis pursues  ‘creative theorizing’ through an approach of ‘unraveling’  by 
challenging  Waltz’  contention  that  nothing  new  can  emerge  from  deducting  out  of a 
frame  already  in  place.  Encouraged  by  the  view  that  it  is  possible  to  generate  new 
knowledge  through  logical  reflection,58  the  strategy  here  is  to  find  a  way  in  which 
theoretical  deduction  becomes  a  creative  process.  Without  denying  that  reflections  are 
informed by (learning more about) the empirical phenomenon, the approach of ‘creative 
theorizing’ advanced here takes place in two steps.

The  first  step  is  to  seek  inspiration  from  existing  theories,  more  precisely  from  their 
limits and  internal tensions.  This  is a  strategy  IR theorists  arguably pursue  all  the time; 
the  attempt here  is  merely to make this process explicit and  give  it a name.  It is termed 
‘unravelling’  and  holds  that  theory  creation  benefits  from  taking  a  ‘deep’  look  at  the 
hard  core  of  existing  research  programmes  which  have  proven 
to 
accommodate  the  ‘novel  fact’.  More  precisely,  the  task  is  to  isolate  ‘fundamentals’, 
namely insights on which the originality of the causal narrative is based, and to  identify 
‘openings’,  namely  insights  identified  as  important  yet  which  are  not  fully  thought 
through and often a source of ambiguity and tension in the causal narrative.

inadequate 

Applied  to  the  case  at  hand,  this  requires  engaging the  logical  thrust  of theories  at the 
centre  of  the  three  dominant  research  programmes  in  IR  -   (neo)realism,  (liberal) 
institutionalism, and (social) constructivism -  which cannot fully explain the emergence 
and  demise  of the  German-American  security  cooperation  as  defined  here.  Rather than 
trying  to  adjust  their  ‘protection  belts’  by  devising  new  ‘auxiliary  hypothesis’,  the 
strategy  here  is  to  trace  their  basic  weaknesses  to  their  respective  ‘hard  core’.  An 
unravelling  approach  requires  ignoring  the  claim  made  by  some  that  the  hard  core  is 
‘privileged knowledge’  not to be challenged directly (Elman and Fendius Elman,  1997), 
which  echoes  Waltz’  repeated  claim  that  one  cannot  criticize  (his)  assumptions.  Such 
disciplining claims can be  ignored  if the primary motivation to engage the  ‘hard core’  is

58 Most famously upheld by John  Stuart Mill, see Russell (2001  [1912]: 44).

42

not  to  criticize  existing  research  programmes,59  but  to  tap 
into  this  ‘privileged 
knowledge’  in the hope that doing so opens up sites of inspiration through which a new 
theory can be created.

The second  step is to take these  ‘fundamentals’  and  ‘openings’  as signposts for building 
a new argument (causal  narrative), directing attention to certain points which need to be 
addressed.  In  line  with  the  notion  that  ‘deep  theorizing’  is  a philosophical  approach, 
those  signposts  are  turned  into  creative  material  and  a  new  theoretical  argument 
grounded in a ‘hard core’  by drawing on  insights from philosophers who have addressed 
the  issues identified through  unravelling existing research programmes. This thesis does 
so by engaging mainly, but not exclusively,  insights offered by Heidegger and Aristotle. 
Again, the purpose for engaging philosophers  is not to turn them  into IR theorists but to 
use them as sources of inspiration for the building a new theory.

Reading the Hard Core: Causation Begins With a ‘Condition1

As  an  unravelling approach  is  about engaging the  ‘hard  core’  of a  research  programme, 
it  is  necessary  to  get  an  understanding  of the  ‘hard  core’.  This  thesis  goes  beyond  the 
view that  it  is  made of irrefutable assumptions to  argue that theories  are anchored  in  an 
account of the human condition.

This  point  is  arrived  at  by  tracing  arguments  over  what  makes  a  theory  internally 
persuasive.  For  Donald  Spence  (1982)  the  most  important  feature  of  a  persuasive 
narrative  is cohesiveness,  which  he discusses  by drawing  links to aesthetics  and  artistic 
beauty. This feature is often captured  in the notion that a theory must be  ‘elegant’ which 
for  scholars  like  Waltz  means  simple  or  ‘parsimonious’.  The  maxim  of parsimony  is 
also  captured  in  what  according  to  Waltz  are  four  basic  ways  -   isolation,  abstraction, 
aggregation,  and  idealization -  alongside  which  theory  building  should  be  pursued  and 
which  boils down to creating an  ‘ideal type’  model of interstate relations which focuses 
only  on  what  ‘really’  matters.  For  him  the  overarching  aim  is  “to  find  the  central 
tendency  among  a  confusion  of tendencies,  to  single  out  the  propelling  principle  even 
though  other principles  operate,  to  seek the  essential  factors  where  innumerable  factors 
are  present”  (Waltz  1979:  10).  While  not  all  agree  on  the  virtue  of  ‘parsimony’  or 
simplicity  (George  and  Bennett  2004),  there  is  little  dispute  that  a  central  tenet  of a

59 Although  if the  hard  core  is  where  the  explanatory  narrative  is  anchored  and  so  if ultimately 
this  ‘privileged knowledge’  makes or breaks a theory, then  it must be the primary  site  of theory 
evaluation.

43

theory  is  internal  consistency,  or logical  coherence,  of the  argumentative chain.  Indeed, 
argumentative  logic  for  many  is  what  holds  a theory  together.  It  is  a  central  feature  of 
the  positivism  of  Ayer  or  Popper  and  the  backbone  of  some  important  theoretical 
interventions  made  in  IR,  such  as  Joseph  Grieco’s  comparison  of  neorealism  and 
neoliberalism (Grieco,  1990,  1993). As Stefano Guzzini (1998: xii) puts it in his analysis 
of the  realist  research  programme  “by  understanding  theories  from  their  inner  logic  it 
becomes possible to ascertain how they shape...explanations”.

Yet  logic  is  not sufficient.  For one,  it differs  from  beauty  more  in  degree than  in  kind, 
that is, there is more than one ‘logic’. Moreover, it does not tell the analyst where to start 
or  stop;  as  Peter Winch  (1990)  reminds  so  memorably,  links  between  links  can  always 
be  found.  Most  importantly,  an  explanatory  narrative,  or what  Sabine  calls  “statements 
of what  may roughly be  called  a causal  nature”  (Sabine,  1969  (1931):  12)  may  be  held 
together  by  logic  but  cannot  be  entirely  generated  by  it.  It  is  suggested  here  that  the 
persuasiveness  of a  causal  narrative  broadly  understood  originates  in  a  philosophical 
reflection  about  the  human  condition.  Causality  of this  kind  informs  David  Boucher’s 
suggestion  that  a  theory 
imaginative  attempt  to  formulate  principles  and 
incorporate  them  into  systematic  order  “directed not  so  much  to  the  resolution  of the 
particular problems out of which they arose, but primarily to the place o f those problems 
generally  in  the  human predicament”  (Boucher  1998:  10.  emphasis  added).  Boucher’s 
distinction  between  solving  a  problem  and  placing  it  in  the  context  of  the  human 
predicament  or,  as  emphasized  here,  the  human  condition,  is  important  and  must  be 
looked at more carefully.

is  an 

To  begin  with,  an approach  grounding the  causal  narrative  in  an  account of the  human 
condition  is  different  from  an  approach  building  on  certain  assumptions  about  human 
nature (Arendt  1958:  9f.).  While  both  face the  issue  of anthropomorphism (see  below), 
their  implications  for  and  demands  of  theorizing  are  quite  different.  The  former  is 
concerned  with  delineating  the  spatio-temporal  environment  self-conscious  humans 
finds  themselves  in  and  with  exploring  how  their  perception  of  these  dimension 
influences  behaviour  (Harvey,  1989).  Human  nature  arguments  operate  with  fixed  and 
quasi  essentialist  understandings  of  ‘interests’  or  ‘drivers’  shared  by  all  humans 
independent of time and  space,  most famously the  ‘will to  power’.  Although there may 
be different ‘natures’ to chose from, once asserted the assumption is easily established as 
a  universal  baseline.  By  contrast,  an  account  of the  human  condition  requires  a  more 
context-sensitive approach.  While the  broad  parameters  of the condition  are assumed to 
be  a  universal,  that  is,  shared  by  all  humans,  such  as  in  the  famous  ‘state  of nature’

44

assumption underlying social contract philosophy (Kersting,  1996), this perspective does 
not  necessarily assume that all  humans  respond  in  exactly the  same way.  In that  sense, 
“the  conditions  of human  existence...never condition  us  absolutely”  and  so  one  might 
say that the condition is “self-made to a considerable extent” (Arendt,  1958:  10, 9).

Judging  from  the  literature,  the  ‘human  nature’  assumption  appears  to  be  the  more 
prominent  road  taken  by  IR  theorists;60  although  at  closer  look  this  is  somewhat 
misleading.  As  the  discussion  in  the  next two  chapters  will  show,  the  most  significant 
interventions  in  IR theory  have  always  involved,  indeed  focused  upon,  a  re-reading  of 
the spatial and temporal dimension of the  ‘units’  of investigation. Yet for most of the IR 
literature  one  can  safely  echo  David  Harvey’s  note  that  “space  and  time  are  basic 
categories  of  human  existence.  Yet  we  rarely  debate  their  meanings”  (Harvey  1989: 
201).  A  key question  arising with  both  human nature and  human condition  accounts  is, 
of  course,  how  it  can  be  applied  to  the  level  of  ‘the  state’.  This  question  will  be

A  causal  narrative  anchored  in  an  account of the  human  condition  resonates  with  what 
has  been  called  ‘constitutive’  theorizing  popular  in  non-positivist  research  and  thus 
distinguished  from  ‘causal’  theorizing attributed to positivists (Smith,  1995).61  As noted 
earlier,  positivists demand  not much  more than  a hypothesis  stating a clear cause-effect 
relationship  between  ‘dependent’  and  ‘independent’  variable.  Statements  of the  kind  ‘x 
causes y’  are characterized by assuming that (1) x and y  exist independent of each other, 
(2) jc precedes y  temporally, and (3) without x, y  would  not have occurred and gain their 
value  only  through  empirical  evidence  (that  is,  in  competition  against  other  pairs 
proposing  a  different  relationship).62  By  contrast,  non-positivists  assume  that  human 
perceptions  of their world,  the  definitions  of their  interests/goals  based  and,  ultimately, 
their  behaviour  is  based  on  meanings  which  cannot  be  reduced  to  generalizing 
statements  based  on  universal  assumptions (Kratochwil,  1989:  24;  Winch,  1990).  They 
argue  that  research  must  focus  on  structures  or  processes  attributing  meaning  to 
interests/motives/goals  and  suggest  that  these  ‘constitutive’  forces  operate  in  an 
intersubjective  manner  which  cannot  be  grasped 
linear/unidirectional 
understanding of relationships but require a hermeneutical approach.63

Whereas  for  Steve  Smith  these  two  approaches  rest  on  different  meta-theoretical 
positions  which  require  “radically different types  of theory”  (Smith  1995:  27),  scholars 
like  Wendt  argue  that  they  should  be  seen  as  applying  to  different  stages  of  the 
argumentative chain,  addressing what  others  settle  on  the  level  of assumptions  without 
abandoning the idea of doing causal  or explanatory research (Wendt,  1998,  1999).64 The 
perspective  advanced  here  falls  somewhere  in  between.  Smith  is  correct  in  pointing  to 
the  distinction  between  ‘shallow’  and  ‘deep’  theorising,  with  the  former  prevailing 
among  positivists,  however  Wendt  has  a  point  when  he  suggests  that  ‘constitutive’ 
research  does  not  need  to  discard  the  notion  of  ‘causality’,  broadly  understood. 
Reflecting  about  how  goals/motives  are  rooted  in  an  account  of the  human  condition 
takes  a  ‘constitutive’  perspective;  yet  investigating  how the  ‘national  interest’  acquires 
meaning is also part of a causal narrative.65 As Kratochwil notes

“to  have  explained  an  action  often  means  to  have  made  intelligible  the 
goals  for  which  it  was  undertaken.  In  this  sense  our  explanations  appear 
‘causal’...since,  by  definition,  motives  are  always  prior to  the  action  and 
can  thus  be  considered  its  antecedent  conditions”  (Kratochwil,  1989:
24f).66

In other words,  making intelligibly a states’  decision to  invest  in  a new institution  relies 
significantly  on  understanding  what  goal  the  state  pursues  and  what  meaning  this 
institution possesses  in helping it to reach this goal. Expanding the scope of the  ‘causal’ 
narrative  in  this  ‘constitutive’  sense  is  engaging  in  what  Nicholas  Onuf  calls  “deep 
causality” and is a central feature of a ‘deep theory’ (Onuf,  1989; also Kurki, 2006).67

Although  as  noted  earlier  it  is  rarely  specified  in  these  terms,  beginning  a  causal 
narrative  with  an  account  of what  ‘condition’  the  state  is  in  should  be  familiar  to  IR 
scholars.  It lies at the heart of one of the most influential conceptual frames in the study 
of  international  politics,  namely  the  (neorealist)  conception  of  international  anarchy. 
This  conception  and  its  parameters  will  be  engaged  in  the  next  chapter;  for  now  it

64 Wendt is a bit confusing on this point. Constitutive theorizing not merely rejects the positivist 
view  that  x  and y  exist  independent  from  each  other,  it  investigates' the  meaning  of x  and  y 
constituted by z.
65  Searle  (1995)  describes  the  constitutive  processes  in  causal  terms.  See  also  (Kurki,  2006). 
Similarly,  contra King et al.  (1994),  as  pointed  out by  Max  Weber  ‘understanding’  is  a form  of 
explanation as well (Weber,  1992:  107f).  See also Wendt (1998); Wight (2002).
66  Peter  Winch  initially  argued  for  making a difference  between  ‘causes’  in  the  scientific  sense
and human  ‘motives’. However, three decades later he seemed to have changed his mind (Winch, 
1990: xii).

suffices to  point out that realist thinking about the  ‘condition’  of interstate relations has 
significant  impact  on  their  understanding  what  international  politics  is  all  about  The 
fundamental  distinction  realists  make  between  a  theory  about  relations  between  states 
and  a  theory  concerned  with  domestic  order  or,  as  Martin  Wight  puts  it,  “speculation 
about  the  state”  (Wight,  1966:  17),  rests  on  the  view  that  these  two  settings  are 
characterized  by  two  different  ‘conditions’.  According  to  realists,  whereas  relations 
between  states must deal  with  a Hobbesian  ‘state of nature’  characterized  by recurrence 
of violence/war,  relations  within  states  have  escaped  this  setting  and  are  about  sorting 
the terms of the social contract. Consequently, the kinds o f ‘politics’ characterizing these 
two  settings  are  different.  As  Wight  put  it,  whereas  in  the  domestic realm  scholars  can 
apply “the theory of the good  life”  international theory must be “the theory of survival” 
(Ibid., 33). This distinction between  ‘domestic’  and  ‘international’  also underlies Waltz’ 
claim  that  there  is  a  difference  between  foreign  policy  analysis  and  a  theory  of 
international  politics,  which  spurred  the  view  that  the  latter  is  not  concerned  with 
explaining  motives  (Waltz  1979  in  Keohane  1986:  12If;  Elman  1996;  Zakaria  1998: 
14).68

These  claims  actually  sell  short  the  depth  of realist theorizing  and  are  misleading  (see 
chapter  three).  As  noted  earlier,  deep  theorizing  is  fundamentally  about  making 
intelligible motives. And as suggested below,  it anchors the causal narrative on the level 
of the ontology of the  state,  which  is  another way to  say that discerning the  ‘condition’ 
states find themselves in inevitably requires ‘speculation about the state’.

The Parameters of the ‘National (Security) Interest’
The  introduction  laid out that an  explanation of why states cooperate and cease to do  so 
must give meaning to the  ‘common  interest’  or,  more precisely, a shared  self-interest.  It 
also  noted  that  although  a  focus  on  interests  is  often  associated  with  ‘economic’  or 
‘utilitarian’  explanations, the assumption that states act out o f ‘self-interest’  underlies all 
three  IR theories.69  This  section  does  not  aim  at  defining this  interest  but,  rather,  will 
provide  the  conceptual  ground  from  which  its  formulation  through  an  account  of the 
human  condition  can  proceed.  More  precisely,  what  are  the  parameters  of the  national

68 As  Fareed Zakaria summarizes this  view,  a theory of foreign  policy  explains why  states  have 
“different intentions”,  or  interests,  while a theory of international  politics explains “international 
events”, or outcomes. The former may illuminate the reasons for a particular nation’s  ‘search  for 
allies’, but a general explanation for the  ‘formation of alliances’ can only be provided by a theory 
which  fixes the meaning of intentions on  the  level  of assumptions (Zakaria  1998:  14;  also  Rose 
1998).

(security)  interest  governments  are  expected  to  pursue  (for  the  successful  pursuit  of 
which they are held responsible/accountable) on the basis of which they make decisions 
over investment in international (security) institutions?

From  Morgenthau  (1960)  onwards,  IR  scholars  across  the  theoretical  spectrum 
periodically  remind  us  of  the  importance  of  the  concept  of  the  ‘national  interest’ 
(Nuechterlein  1985;  Krasner  1987;  Weldes  1999;  Williams  2005).  Yet they  also  point 
out that the  question  of ‘what  is the  national  interest’  has  no  single answer if it departs 
from  a  certain  level  of  abstraction.  As  Arnold  Wolfers  puts  it,  “the  national  interest 
indicates that the policy  is designed to promote demands that are ascribed to the nation 
(...).  It  emphasizes  that  the  policy  subordinates  other  interests  to  those  of the  nation. 
Beyond  this,  it  has  very  little  meaning”  (Wolfers,  1962:  147,  emphasis  added).  In  an 
attempt  to  specify  the  concept,  one  might  differentiate  between  short  and  long-term 
interests,  or  to  see 
the  former 
(preferences)  deducted  from  and  advancing  certain  interests  and  the  latter  (desires) 
driving or giving rise to a certain  interest.  From that perspective one could try and trace 
the  ‘preference’  for a  certain  institution  to  some sort of ‘desire’,  bypassing the  concept 
of  interest  and  render  it  analytically  redundant.  While  there  is  something  to  this 
approach,  it  is  easy  to  get  lost  in  semantics.  Even  more  so,  if  one  accepts  that 
policymakers  are  guided  by  something they  consider  the  ‘national  interest’,  bypassing 
the concept does not seem to be analytically helpful (Williams 2005).

interests  distinct  from  preferences  and  desires, 

What can  be  said  is  that the  national  interest  is  assumed  to  refer to  something basic,  or 
vital,  and  in  that  sense  is  necessarily  ‘long  term’.  One  scholar  captures  this  under  the 
notion of a  ‘vital national  interest’:  “an  interest is vital when the highest policymakers in 
a  sovereign  state  conclude  that  the  issue  at  stake  is  so  fundamental  to  the  political, 
economic,  and  social  well-being  of their  country  that  it  should  not  be  compromised” 
(Nuechterlein  1985:  26).  Rather  than  splitting  the  ‘national  interest’  up  in  various 
sectoral  understandings  of  ‘well  being’,  IR  scholars  in  an  attempt  to  pin  down  the 
national security interest (which by definition is a ‘vital’  interest) tend to make use of the 
human analogy and resort to Hobbes’ emphasis on self-preservation, or survival. At least 
since John Herz declared “let us think first of all  about how to  survive, thereafter about 
everything else”  (Herz  1962:  3),  scholars  across the theoretical  spectrum  from  Wolfers 
(1962)  and  Wight  (1966)  via  Waltz  (1979)  to  Wendt  (1999)  readily  translate  the 
Hobbesian  assumption  of the  individual’s  ‘will’  for  self-preservation  into  the  realm  of 
international  politics.  Even  more  sophisticated  attempts  to  provide  a  ‘new  framework’ 
for security analysis build on the  assumption that “security  is about survival” (Buzan  et

48

al.,  1998:  21),  and  it  certainly  appears  to  be  accepted  wisdom  among  scholars  dealing 
with  the  phenomenon  of  security  cooperation  (Powell,  1994:  320f;  Stein  1990:  87f; 
Levy, 2002:  131).70

The focus on self-preservation implies that security policy is, at bottom, about protecting 
‘the state’  from serious harm by preventing things from happening which endangers ‘its’ 
existence. David Baldwin captures this by suggesting that the  ‘national  security interest’ 
is  formulated  on  the  basis  of two  components:  a  referent  object  (the  ‘state’)  and  an 
existential  threat  as  something  (perceived  to  be)  capable  of  doing  harm  to  the  core 
features  of the  former and  endangering  its  existence  (Baldwin  1997;  also  Buzan  1991; 
Waever  et  al.,  1993).  Hence,  the  conceptualization  of the  state  is  crucial  because  it 
informs the definition of the existential threat.  Without knowing what governments seek 
to preserve it is  impossible for the analyst to understand what they fear.  Said differently, 
the  ‘national  security  interest’  only  becomes  intelligible  by  identifying  the  baseline 
features  of the  state’s  existence  and  what  its vulnerabilities  are.  As  Barry  Buzan  points 
out,  threats  and  vulnerabilities  are  intrinsically  linked  as  “only  when  one  has  a 
reasonable  idea  of  both  the  nature  of  threats,  and  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  objects 
towards  which  they  are  directed,  can  one  begin  to  make  sense  of  national  security” 
(Buzan  1991:  112).

This  means  that,  logically  speaking,  a  causal  narrative  explaining  choices  made  in  the 
name  of ‘national  security’  cannot  simply  stop  with  an  emphasis  on  ‘survival’  as  the 
basic  interest.  Questions  of whether  and  how  to  differentiate  between  ‘subjective’  and 
‘objective’  accounts  of national  security  (Wolfers  1962:  150ff),  echoed  in  the  question 
whether threat may be  misperceived (Jervis  1976),  and the debate  over the widening of 
the meaning of security since the end of the Cold War suggest that state survival may be 
interpreted  in  different  ways,  a crucial  point  made  by  Wolfers  some time ago  (Wolfers 
1962:  73).71  Indeterminism about what it means for a state to survive  is also reflected  in 
the  disagreement about the  occurrence  of state  ‘death’:  while  some  scholars  claim  that 
“the  world...provides  a  historical  record  replete  with  examples  of countries  that  have 
disappeared”  (Stein  1990:  87),  others  assert  that  “the  death  rate  among  states  is 
remarkably  low”  (Waltz,  1979:  95;  also  Strang,  1991)  or  “almost  nil”  (Wendt  1999: 
279).  These  different  views  do  not  stem  from  counting  errors  but  from  different 
conceptions  of what  a  state  is,  what  it  needs  in  order  to  be.  It  reflects  that  there  are

multiple ways to conceptualize statehood, each version carrying a unique understanding 
of  what  it  means  for  a  state  to  exist,  what  its  vulnerabilities  and  threats  are  and, 
consequently,  what  it means to  die  (Beitz,  1979:  52-55).  Thus,  the conceptualization  of 
the  state  lies  at the  heart  of a  ‘deep’  causal  narrative.  Rather than  separating theorizing 
about  survival  and  ‘speculating  about  the  state’,  as  Wight  suggested,  the  two  are 
intrinsically linked.

From Humans to ‘States’
A handful of IR scholars exploring the meaning of the state show that this can be done in 
a  variety  of ways (e.g.,  Halliday,  1994;  Ringmar  1996;  Hobson,  2000).  Yet an  opening 
the black box and the attempt to  ‘look  inside’ the state can also end up without it.  More 
precisely,  it  is  useful  to  follow  Erik  Ringmar’s  advice  and  avoid  having  the  state 
disintegrate  into  various  parts  which  do  not  make  a  whole.  A  fragmentation  into 
different government branches, interests groups, public opinion, media, courts, and so on 
renders  ‘the  state’  too  complex  for  theorising  and  empty  of meaning  (Ringmar  1996: 
449). The underlying view, adopted here and discussed  in more detail  in chapter four,  is 
that  any  conception  of  being,  whether  individuals  or  collectives,  needs  meaning.  As 
Michael  Walzer  points  out,  the  state  “must  be  personified  before  it  can  be  seen, 
symbolised  before  it  can  be  loved,  imagined  before  it  can  be  conceived”  (in  Ruggie 
1993:  157).

Yet  in  ‘personifying’  the  state  the  question  of  anthropomorphism  emerges,  namely 
whether  the  state  can  be  imagined  as  a  person,  a  human  being.  More  precisely,  the 
question  is  how  far  the  human  analogy  can  be  carried  analytically,  which  becomes  all 
the  more  relevant  given  the  earlier  mentioned  suggestion  that  the  state  and  its  interest 
should  be  read  through  an  account  of the  ‘human  condition’.  Roughly  speaking,  IR 
scholars have dealt with the state-human analogy in three ways.72

Most  common  is  the  ‘as  i f   assumption,  which  holds  that  treating  the  state  like  an 
individual  is  a  useful  short  cut  to  simplify  matters,  that  is,  a  necessary  abstraction  to 
build  theories.  This  position  does  not  suggest  that  the  state  really  is  a  human 
being/person  (indeed,  accepts  that  it  is  not)  but  argues  that  theories  attributing 
assumptions  about  human  desires  to  the  state  can  provide  useful  models  for  making 
sense  of international  politics.  Scholars  like  Waltz  are  thus  able  to  treat  the  state  as  “a 
unit complete with will and purpose” (Waltz, 2001  (1959):  173).

72  See  also  Ringmar  (1996)  and  the  ‘Forum  on  the  State  as  a  Person’,  Review  of International 
Studies 30, no. 2 (2004).

50

The second position, put forward  by Alexander Wendt, argues that the state actually is a 
person  or,  rather,  can  be  conceptualised  as  possessing  similar  properties  as  a  human 
being,  including  an  organism,  motives  (cognitive  and  emotional)  and  a  consciousness 
(Wendt  1999;  2004).  Drawing on  sociology, anthropology, and even  biology it suggests 
that communities possess features similar to those of individual  human beings,73  such  as 
a ‘collective consciousness’, and that desires driving individuals also drive communities.

The  third  approach  is  sceptical  about  abstractions  and  of transferring  insights  about 
humans to collectives,  or communities.  Instead,  it holds that attributing human qualities 
to a state only makes sense to the extent that state is represented by actual  persons,  such 
as  government  officials.  It  conceptualises  the  state  as,  for  instance,  a  structure  in  and 
through  which  individuals  (political  leaders)  act,  facing  all  kinds  of  constraints  and 
opportunities this structure brings with it (Sprout and Sprout  1965; Wight 2006).

While  these  three  approaches  appear  substantially  different,  when  combining  theory 
with  empirical  analysis  it  is tempting to  see them  as overlapping,  moving from  the first 
to  the  third  as  the  discussion  proceeds  from  the  theoretical  to  the  empirical  level.  Yet 
this  move  needs  to  be  justified  conceptually.  Even  if  one  assumes  that  a  society  is 
conscious  of  its  spatio-temporal  situatedness  as  a  collective,  something  must  be  said 
about how political leaders are embedded in and are able to represent this consciousness. 
Thus,  applying  philosophical  accounts  of the  human  condition  to  ‘the  state’  level  and 
using  this  for  explaining  inter-state  phenomena  must  conceptualize  how  the  individual 
relates  to  and  comes  to  ‘represent’  the  collective  (Self/Society)  and  the  relationship 
between these representatives (Self/Society -  Self/Society).

How proponents of the three IR theories read ‘the state’ and  ‘existential threats’  and how 
these  readings  are anchored  in  (presumably different)  accounts  of the  human  condition 
will  be  discussed  in  the  next  chapter.  Yet  it  should  be  pointed  out  here  already  that 
engaging these  different conceptions  inevitably  brings up  issues  of the  relative  (causal) 
importance of ‘material’  and  ‘ideational’  factors.  Indeed, there appears to be widespread 
consensus among  IR scholars that the  decision  whether one  chooses the  ‘materialist’  or 
the  ‘idealist’  path  is a fundamental  one.  Anchored  in the  first  ‘great debate’  in  IR,  they 
are  portrayed  as  two  orientations  which  stand  not  merely  for  a  debate  within  IR  but 
realists
provide  different  approaches

representing  the  ‘material’  and  constructivists  the  ‘ideational’  camp  (Wendt  1999, 
Ruggie  1998).  While there  is  something to this  division  of labour,  the  question  is  how 
deep  it  goes,  that  is,  whether  it  actually  resonates  with  the  hard  core  of  respective 
research  programmes.  For  now  it  suffices  to  say  that  all  attempts  advocating  ideas  as 
‘causes’  face  the  familiar  problem  of  how  to  interpret  ‘what  is  in  peoples  heads’, 
mentioned in the  introduction. The problem that one cannot  ‘see’  ideas  in the same way 
as  one  can  touch  material  elements  like  rocks  means  that  causal  narratives  taking  into 
account the former must make an even greater effort to theorize carefully about why and 
how ideas matter in the conception of the state and  its existential threats.

To  close  the  circle,  if a  deep  theory  perspective  focuses  on  how  the  national  security 
interest  emerges  in  the  conceptualization  of ‘the  state’  and  the  ‘existential  threat’,  the 
presence (or absence) of a common security interest depends on the degree to which the 
two  are  shared.  In  other  words,  for  states  to  cooperate  in the  security  realm  they  must 
perceive their existence as somehow interlinked/interdependent and agree on a common 
(or shared) existential threat.  A deep theory perspective  suggests that the parameters on 
the  basis  of which  such  commonalities  are  established  are  logically  embedded  in  an 
account  of the  human  condition.  The  following  chapter will  discuss  how  the  dominant 
research  programmes  in  IR  have  dealt  with  this  task  by  unravelling  their  causal 
narratives on interstate security cooperation.

CHAPTER THREE: UNRAVELLING THE FIELD

Summary
This  chapter  unravels  the  three  major  research  programmes,  realism,  institutionalism, 
and  constructivism  for  the  purpose  of theory  building.  As  such,  it  offers  more  than  a 
literature overview. As  outlined  in the  introduction, the  logical  thrust of all  three causal 
narratives  runs  into  problems  when  trying  to  explain  the  ‘novel  fact’  of  German- 
American  cooperation  outlined  in  the  first  chapter,  captured  in  the  balancing  bias 
(realism),  sunk-cost  bias  (institutionalism)  and  socialization  bias  (constructivism). 
Following  the  strategy  for  creative  theorizing  laid  out  in  the  previous  chapter,  the 
purpose  of this  chapter  is  to  unravel  the  logic  carrying  their  respective  arguments  by 
carving  out their conception  of the  ‘common  interest’  and  tracing  it to  their  hard  core, 
that  is,  to  an  account  the  spatio-temporal  situatedness  of the  state.  The  purpose  is  not 
merely  to  identify  weaknesses  but  openings,  that  is,  conceptual  insights  identified  by 
proponents  of each  research  programme  as  important  yet  which  are  not  fully  thought 
through  and  often  a  source  of ambiguity and  tension  within  the  causal  narrative.  Thus, 
the aim  is not to turn these theories  into straw men for the purpose of burning them, but 
to  learn  from  them  and  use  them  as  sources  of  inspiration  for  building  a  new/better 
theory.  As  such,  whereas  the  criticism  presented  here  may  not  be  new  the  angle  from 
which it is formulated is.

As realism provides the baseline argument on which the other two research programmes 
are  built,  this  chapter  begins  with  and  spends  most time  on  the  task  of unravelling the 
realist narrative.  This  is  followed  by a brief look at the  instutionalist narrative,  with  the 
third  part  focusing  on  constructivism.  Although  the  writings  of  a  large  number  of 
authors  inform the discussion,  for each (alleged) research  programme the conception  of 
the  hard  core  is  illustrated through the writings  of key representatives,  namely Kenneth 
Waltz 
and  Alexander  Wendt

say that the academic study of international relations is a debate about realism”. With an 
unbroken  air  of essentialism,  realists  claim  to  capture  the  basic  forces  governing  our 
lives  and  to  provide  the  best  account  of  ‘common  sense’  behaviour  among  states 
(Grieco,  1993:  3;  Guzzini,  1998;  Walt,  2002).  They  follow  Machiavelli  in  propagating 
the  necessity  “to  accept  reality  unvarnished”  (Stein,  1990:  4)  and  “to  understand 
international  politics  as 
realist 
Erkenntnisinteresse  is  to  identify  the  ‘true’  national  interest  and  with  it  the  ‘laws  of 
politics’  determining interstate conflict and cooperation.

(Morgenthau,  1960:  15).  The 

it  actually 

is” 

Since  the  foundational  writings  of  E.H.  Carr  (2001)  and  Hans  Morgenthau  (1960)  a 
number  of  realist  ‘theories’  developed  and  generated  “different  worlds  of  realism” 
(Guzzini  1998),75 which raises the question whether there still is a realist hard core.  In an 
influential  critique,  Jeffrey  Legro  and  Andrew  Moravcsik  (1999)  argue  from  a 
Lakatosian  perspective  that  ‘realism’  has  become  internally  incoherent.  They  suggest 
that  the  theories  formulated  by  a  new  generation  of  realists  -   sometimes  labelled 
‘neoclassical’  realists  (Rose  1998)  -   share  “little  more  than  a  generic  commitment to 
rational  state  behavior  in  anarchy”  (Legro  and  Moravcsik,  2000:  184).  Legro  and 
Moravcsik basically argue that the realist hard core has become too weak/elastic to serve 
as  a  meaningful  reference  point,  with  the  consequence  that  the  paradigm  has  become 
indistinguishable from  institutionalism and constructivism.76

This  chapter  echoes  some  of that  critique,  although  from  a  different  angle  and  with  a 
different  intention.  Whereas  Legro  and  Moravcsik  read  the  ‘hard  core’  as  made  up  of 
assumptions and pursue the (unstated) objective to put realism back in  ‘its’  box, here the 
aim is to unravel the realist account of the human condition with the objective to explore 
the  paradigms’  argumentative  weakness  for  the  case  at  hand  and  retrieve  its  creative 
potential.

(1994); Lebow (1994); Vasquez (1997); Legro and Moravcsik (1999).
75 After Waltz’  version (Waltz  1979; 2000) lost its appeal with the end of the Cold War,  realism 
bounced  back  to  life  in  fragments  with  scholars  modifying  neorealism  (Buzan  et  al.,  1993; 
Schweller,  1998;  Mearsheimer,  2001),  providing domestic  explanations  for  realist  assumptions 
(Snyder,  1991;  Johnston,  1995;  Wolforth,  1993;  Zakaria,  1998)  even  giving  it  a  constructivist 
touch  (Williams,  2005;  Goddard  and  Nexon,  2005).  Waltz’s  ‘neo’  prefix  was  rebranded  as 
‘structural’  (Buzan  et al.  1993),  ‘offensive’  and  ‘defensive’  (Snyder  1991),  ‘contingent’  (Glaser, 
1994),  ‘neoclassical’  (Rose,  1998),  or  ‘wilful’  (Williams  2005).  For  overviews  see  Frankel

The Balancing Bias
As  noted  in  chapter  one,  the  logical  thrust  of  realism’s  balance  of  power  argument 
cannot  account for the dynamic of German-American  cooperation  as  defined  here.  It  is 
at odds with parts of Germany cooperating with the US in NATO at a time where the US 
was the strongest power in the system (period one), it cannot explain German investment 
in  CSCE  at  a  time  of  (perceived)  decline  in  US  power  (period  two),  or  German 
investment  in  CFSP,  which  occurred  at  a  time  of  growing  US  power  yet  lacks 
characteristics  of an  instrument for deterrence  and,  hence,  the  key qualities  of a  realist 
balancing move (period three).77

The task of tracing the conceptual weakness of the balancing argument to the realist hard 
core  it  makes  sense  to  start  with  the  four  basic  assumptions  generally  attributed  to 
realism:78  (1)  states  are the principal  actors  in  international  politics,  (2)  states  behave as 
rational  and  self-interested actors who (3) compete for power in  an  international  system 
without  central  authority  (anarchy),  with  (4)  the  anarchic  character  of the  international 
system  being  the  principal  force  shaping  (the  actions  of)  states.  As  the  first  two 
assumptions  are  also  shared  by  other  paradigms  and  generic  for  a  theory  of interstate 
security  cooperation,  the  uniquely  realist conception  of what makes a  ‘self interest’  lies 
with the last two assumptions.

Implicit  in the assumption that states compete for power is that states want power.  This 
assumption  has  been  central  to  realist  attempts  to  make  sense  of international  politics 
from  the  start.  Carr  (2001:  92)  famously  noted  that  “politics  cannot  be  divorced  from 
power”  and  Morgenthau  declared  that  “statesmen  think  and  act  in  terms  of  interests 
defined  as  power”  and  that  power  is  “the  immediate  aim”  of all  states  (Morgenthau 
1960:  5, 27).  Indeed, one  is hard  pressed to find an  IR scholar who would disagree with 
Brian  Schmidt’s observation that “realists throughout the ages have argued that power is 
the decisive determinant” in the relations among states, and that “all  realists characterise 
international  politics  in terms of a continuous  struggle for power” (Schmidt 2007:  44f). 
Although  some  attribute  the  will  for  power  to  human  nature  and,  thus,  suggest  that 
power  is  sought  as  an  end  in  itself,  the  prevalent  understanding  among  realists  is  that 
states  seek  power  as  a  means  to  the  end  of ‘survival’.  How  this  link  is  established  is 
discussed  later;  for now  it suffices  to  say that the  basic  realist  assumption  is  that  states

77 On the empirical weaknesses of the neorealist balance-of-power argument more generally, see 
Vasquez  (1995,  1997),  who  uses  a  Lakatosian  framework  and  relies  significantly  on  Paul 
Schroeder’s (1994) work. For a response, see Waltz (1997); Elman and Fendius Elman (1997).

seek power as a means for protection against the existential threat, which also is defined 
in  terms  of power.  Indeed,  the  latter  leads  to  the  former,  that  is,  because  for  realists 
“power...is  the  valid  and  complete  measure  of threat”  (Doyle  1997:  168)  states  are 
assumed to want ‘power’ to ensure their security.

In  seeming  contradiction  to  the  popular  view  (often  attributed  to  realism)  that  state 
interests  are  inherently  ‘conflicting’  and  that  cooperation  is  difficult  to  achieve,79 
common  interests  and  cooperation  lies  at  the  heart  of the  oldest  segments  of realist 
thought,  namely  the  balance-of-power  proposition.  This  proposition  comes  in  various 
forms united in the view that some sort of ‘equilibrium’  is an integral part of the order of 
things.80 The most popular version, focused on here, emphasises the tendency of states to 
cooperate  in an effort to counter the most powerful  state,  or coalition  of states.  In  other 
words, the  common  interest bringing states together is the determination to prevent any 
(group  of)  state(s)  to  achieve  or maintain  a  dominant position  through  ‘internal’  and/or 
‘external’  balancing (Waltz  1979).  The  latter  leads to cooperation as “first and  foremost 
a  means  for  adding  interchangeable,  culmulative  power”  (Liska,  1968:  24)  for  the 
purpose  of  deterrence.  Alliances  are  thus  a  “necessary  function”  (Morgenthau  1960: 
181)  and  an  “integral  part” (Levy,  2002)  of the  balance  of power dynamic and  security 
cooperation  a  permanent  feature  of the  realist  understanding  of international  politics.81 
States  may  institutionalise  their  alliance  for  coordination  purposes,  yet  because  they 
don’t  like to  be  constrained  and  aim  at reducing  interdependence  (see  below)  they will 
keep investments in common institutions at a minimum.82

According to the balancing logic, states will end the cooperative relationship when there 
is  a  shift  in  the  distribution  of power,  that  is,  either  when  a  state  within  the  alliance 
increases  its  relative  power or when  the  hegemon  experiences  a decrease  in  its  relative 
power.  More precisely,  states will  cease to cooperate  if they expect a shift in  how gains

79  Realists  may  bridge  the  tension  between  saying  that  cooperation  is  difficult  to  achieve  and 
implying that it occurs all the time by suggesting that it is a practical dilemma (Snyder 1997:  18). 
However,  the  tension  is  also  due  to  the  fact,  rarely  acknowledged,  that  there  are  two  different 
kinds  of cooperation,  namely  between  ‘rivals’  and  between  ‘allies’  (Mearsheimer  1994:  338  in 
Brown).
80  For  discussions,  see  Bull,  (2002  [1977]);  Levy  (2002);  Little  (2007);  Kaufman  et  al.  (2007). 
For  offensive  realists  (e.g.,  Mearsheimer  2001)  and  hegemonic  stability  theorists  (e.g.,  Gilpin 
1981) balancing is neither something that occurs automatically nor is it the preferable/most stable 
configuration.
81  Glenn  Snyder (1997)  provides  a  comprehensive  conceptual  discussion  of alliance  dynamics, 
including the stage of bargaining omitted here. Yet while much of it rests on a (neo)realist frame, 
his discussion does not add up to a coherent theoretical argument (Snyder,  1997: 22ff).
82  Indeed,  because  realists  focus  on  the  distribution  of ‘hard  power’  capabilities  they  don’t pay 
much analytical attention to institutions (Mearsheimer,  1994; Jervis,  1999).

are  or will  be  distributed  between  allies,  that  is,  if the  partner  is  expected  to  grow  too 
strong  in  comparison  to  others.  Just  as  power  shifts  rather  than  disappears,  it  is  more 
correct  to  speak  of shifting alliances than  simply  disintegration,  which  moves  attention 
to  the  existence  of  an  alternative,  prominent  in  the  debate  among  realists  whether 
bipolarity or multipolarity makes the more stable  system  (that is,  produces  more fragile 
alliances).83

As the main problem of the balancing argument for explaining the case at hand  is that it 
cannot  explain  (German)  bandwagoning  (with  the  US),  it  is  useful  to  briefly  review 
attempts  to  conceptually  integrate  this  phenomenon  into  the  realist  narrative.  The 
simplest way  out  is  to  find  refuge  in  the  ‘historical  record’  and  maintain  that  ‘overall’ 
states  were  more  likely  to  choose  balancing  over  bandwagoning.  Instances  in  which  a 
weaker  state  aligns  with the  stronger  state  are  seen  as  misguided  outliers,  the  result  of 
irrational  decisions.84  However,  even  then  realists  have  difficulties  integrating  acts  of 
‘irrationality’  in  their  balancing  narrative.  In  part  this  is  because  realists  pay  little 
attention  to  the  calculations  of weak/small  states.85  Guided  by  the  famous  Thucydides 
quote that  ‘the  weak  suffer what they  must’,  the  paradigm  itself came to  suffer from  a 
great power bias captured by Waltz in noting that “the units of greatest capability set the 
scene  of action  for  others”  (Waltz  1979:  72).86  With  balancing  assumed  to  be  a  quasi 
natural process in which those who did not follow  ‘common sense’  would  learn to do so 
and  otherwise  ‘punished’,87  realists  were  mostly  content  with  arguing  that  balancing 
occurs without specifying how (Levy 2002:  140).

One  notable  attempt  to  come  to  terms  with  ‘bandwagoning’  is  presented  by  Stephen 
Walt,  who  tries  to  turn  it  into  a  rational  decision  within  a  balancing  framework  by 
arguing  that  states  do  not  balance  power  but  threats.88  More  precisely,  he  holds  that

83  Echoing  George  Liska  (1962:  193)  that  “increases  in  alternatives  available  contribute  to 
realignment and alliance dissolution”, Waltz argues that bipolarity is more stable because smaller 
states  have  no  viable  alternative,  whereas  in  a  multipolar  world  an  alliance  “unskillfully 
managed”  may  fall  apart more easily (Waltz  1979:  170).  What makes  ‘(un)skilful  management’ 
remains unclear.
84 Waltz (1979:  126f); Walt (1985);  Snyder (1997); Jervis (1999); Levy (2002).
85  Against  the  argument  that  small  states  are  manipulated  by  the  hegemon  to  go  against  their 
‘common  sense’,  Walt  (1985,  1987)  shows that  ‘bribery’  is  effective only when  a  shared  threat 
already exist.
86 For an exception, see Liska (1962,  1968).
87  As  Holsti  et  al  (1973:  6)  write,  the  balance  of power  proposition  “requires  that  statesmen 
adhere to  certain  rules,  one  of the  most  important  of which  is  that they  must  form  alliances  to 
prevent any nation...from achieving a position of hegemony.  Failure to do so when the situation 
demands it is not merely irrational, it is also a serious dereliction of duty”.
88  Walt also  suggests that regions have their own  dynamic (Walt  1985:  35ff;  see also  Buzan and 
Waever  2004).  Yet  decoupling  regional  power  estimates  from  the  international  system  or

57

states feel threatened not simply by relative military capabilities but by a combination of 
(i)  aggregate  power,  (ii)  geographic  proximity,  (iii)  offensive  military  capabilities,  and 
(iv)  aggressive  intentions.  The  problem  is  that  whereas  the  first  three  factors  can  be 
accommodated  by  the  realist  research  programme,  the  fourth,  which  emphasizes  the 
evaluation  of others  intentions,  cannot.  It  is  not  merely  that  Walt  remains  unclear  on 
what basis states’  evaluate the intentions of others;  his empirical discussion  leads him to 
emphasize  ideology  yet  this  factor  is  not  translated  into  a  coherent  causal  argument 
integrated  into the realist narrative.89 The reason he fails to do so is because an  argument 
emphasizing states weighing (future)  intentions  is  in  conflict with the realist account of 
the  human  condition  and  its  consequence,  discussed  below,  that  states  are  (should  be) 
inherently  pessimistic  about the  (future)  intentions  of others  and  (should)  mistrust each 
other (Waltz, 2000).

Randall  Schweller  (1998;  2006)  takes  up  Walt’s  (1985:  8,  18)  suggestion  that  states 
bandwagon  because they hope to benefit from the  ‘spoils of victory’  (also Snyder  1997: 
18)  and  suggests that states  surrender to  great  powers  because they  pursue  ‘revisionist’ 
aims and  prefer being on the  ‘winning side’  in the  belief that it represents the “wave of 
the  future”  (Schweller  1998:  79).  The  problem  with  this  avenue  is,  again,  that  states 
following  such  a  ‘wave  of the  future’  act  ignore  that  down  the  road  the  strong  state 
might turn  against them.90  In  response  Schweller (2006) presents what he calls  a theory 
of ‘underbalancing’,  or a “theory of mistakes”.  He  presents  a  systematic analysis of the 
domestic configurations of states who bandwagon to explain misperception of intentions 
of a rising power and/or the failure to adopt protective policies with a lack of social  and 
elite  ‘cohesion’  (Schweller 2006:  1 Of.;  128).  While this explanation may have empirical 
merits,  Schweller’s  suggestion  that  a  domestically  fractioned  state  fails  to  perceive  a 
‘great  power’  as  an  existential  threat  and,  by  implication,  is  less  pessimistic  about the 
future  intentions  of others  is  not  grounded  in  something  that  could  be  called  a  deep 
theory (see also Legro and Moravcsik  1999).91

suggesting that the  global  distribution  of power is  viewed through  a  ‘regional  lens’  is  a  serious 
compromise  of the  systemic  scope  of structural  realism.  Moreover,  transferring the  puzzle  to  a 
more confined geographical setting does not eliminate it.
89 Walt’s note that ideology only  affects the choice of allies when states feel  secure already, that 
is,  “face  no  significant  external  threat”  (1987:  217)  is  inconsistent  with  his  argument  that 
ideology may be part of the threat (Ibid).
90  This  is  the  problem  of hegemonic  stability  theory,  which  can  account  for  bandwagoning but 
contradicts the assumption that power is threatening. On how hegemonic stability does not fit the 
realist research programme, see DiCicco and Levy (2003).
91  When  Schweller  (2006:  6f.)  situates  his  argument  in  the  realist  paradigm  he  makes  no 
mentioning of core realist assumptions but only re-states the case  for opening up the  ‘black box’ 
of the state and analyze the configuration of domestic political structures.

58

An  issue not directly addressed by either Walt or Schweller, yet which  is at the heart of 
the  realist  conundrum  why  some  states  do  not  ‘answer’  great power threats  in  the  way 
balancing  logic  dictates,  is  the  question  of  how  to  actually  measure  power.  The 
ubiquitous nature of ‘power’  makes it difficult to trace patterns of alliance formation and 
disintegration  to  shifts  in the distribution  of power.  Morgenthau  (1960:  Ch.  10) already 
discussed  the  problem  of  recognising  shifts  in  the  balance  of  power,  quoting  Lord 
Bolingbroke that “the precise  point at which the  scales of power turn...is  imperceptible 
to  common  observation”  (in  Morgenthau  1960:  206).  Yet  the  issue  is  not  merely  the 
(mis)perception  among  practitioners  about  the  ‘real’  distribution  of power  (Wohlforth
1993)  but the conceptual vagueness of the meaning of ‘power’  as such.  The recognition 
among  sociologists  that  power  is  an  essentially  contested  concept  also  bedevils 
realism.92  As  a  number  of scholars  have  pointed  out,  there  is  no  unified  understanding 
among realists  as to  how  ‘power’  should  be defined,93  reflected  in  disagreements about 
the distribution of power in ‘the system’ at a given point (Schweller  1998; Grieco 2007). 
One  can  find  a  complex  and  multifaceted  understanding  of  power  (Carr  2001, 
Morgenthau  1960), a vague and general one lumping together all kinds of factors (Waltz 
1979) and a more specific and more narrow one (Mearsheimer 2001).

The  problem  this  poses  for  the  realist  narrative  is  obvious:  it  makes  it  difficult  to 
conceptualize  what counts  for a threat and,  hence,  what makes for a  ‘common  interest’ 
and the absence thereof.  The difficulty of realists providing a straightforward  reading of 
power  is  not  intrinsic  to  the  concept,  however.  Contested  as  it  might be,  realists  could 
well  choose  one  particular reading,  as  attempted  by  Mearsheimer (2001).  I  suggest the 
reason  can  be  found  elsewhere:  the  realist  argument  that  states  want  power  to  ensure 
their  survival  ties  the  reading  of power  to  its  conceptualization  of the  state.  Thus,  as 
suggested  by  a  deep  theory  perspective,  the  realist  assumption  that  states  seek  power 
needs to be traced to its account of the spatio-temporal situatedness of the state.

Tracing the H ard Core
As  outlined  in  the  previous  chapter,  tracing  a  causal  narrative  to  an  account  of  the 
human condition  is different from anchoring an assumption  in  ‘human nature’.  Hence,  it 
requires  going  beyond  the  view  that  humans  have  a  natural  desire  for  power  often 
attributed  to  realists  and  traced  to  Machiavelli  (Boucher  1998:  93f.;  Doyle  1997;

92 On multiple meanings of power in IR, see Barnett and Duvall (2005); Berenskoetter (2007).
93  See David Baldwin’s critique of Waltz (Baldwin  1993, 2002).  For different realist conceptions 
of power, see Guzzini (1993); Schmidt (2005).

59

Freyberg-Inan  2004).94  Morgenthau  is  generally  referred  to  as  someone  who  anchors 
aggressive  behaviour  in  human  nature  “in  which  the  laws  of politics  have  their  roots” 
(Morgenthau  1960:  4).  However,  even  Morgenthau’s  understanding of human  nature  is 
complex and he does not link the drive for power to a single human nature attribute.  He 
speaks of bio-psychological drives “to live, to propagate, and to dominate” (Morgenthau 
1960:  33) and mentions sociological  motivations like pride and prestige, as well as “the 
moral principle of national survival” (Morgenthau  1960:  10). In short, when Morgenthau 
claims  that  “whatever  the  ultimate  aims  of international  politics,  power  is  always  the 
immediate aim” (Morgenthau  1946:  13), he leaves open what this  ‘ultimate aim’  is.

interest”  of  states  (Grieco,  1993:  127).  Even  for  offensive  realists 

Since Waltz, structural realists reject the view that humans/states have a natural drive for 
power  and,  instead,  resort  to  Hobbes  in  emphasizing  the  will  for  self-preservation  or 
‘survival’.  Waltz  holds  that  “the  survival  motive  is  the  ground  for  action”  of all  states 
(Waltz  1979:  92),95  Gilpin  argues  that  it  constitutes  the  “objective  component”  in  the 
definition  of the  national  interest  (Gilpin  1996:  8),  and  Grieco  considers  it  to  be  the 
“core 
like 
Mearsheimer  survival  is  the  “number  one  goal”  (Mearsheimer  2001:  46;)  and  “the 
fundamental  assumption  dealing with  motives”  in  realist theory  (Mearsheimer,  1994  in 
Brown  et  al:  335).96  While  acknowledging  that  states  pursue  other,  “more  noble” 
(Gilpin)  goals as well, they are considered  subordinate simply because “only  if survival 
is  assured  can  states  safely  seek  other  goals”  (Waltz  1979:  126).  On  the  question  how 
states turn  from  a  ‘survival-seeker’  into  a  ‘power-seeker’,  realists  point to  international 
anarchy  (see  assumption  (4)  above)  which,  as  is  well  known,  realists  adopt  from  the 
‘state  of  nature’  image  provided  by  Hobbes  (Waltz  2001;  1979;  2000;  Mearsheimer 
2001).  This  image  basically  pictures  individuals coexisting without a third  party  arbiter 
that can solve disputes and enforce rule above them. In Hobbes words, the state of nature 
is a situation of “men living together without a common power to keep them in awe” (in 
Doyle  1997:  113).  Adapted  to  the  inter-state  level,  anarchy  is  “the  ordering  principle 
which  says  that  the  system  comprises  independent  political  units  (states)  that  have  no 
authority above them” (Mearsheimer,  1994: 334)97

94 Some have labeled this the ‘evil’  school of realism (Wolfers  1962:  83; Spirtas,  1996).
95 Waltz solves the tension  (if not contradiction) between his embrace of the survival motive and 
his  dismissal  of human  nature  (or  what  he  calls  ‘first  image’)  arguments  by  treating  the  latter 
fairly narrow as either ‘good’ (peaceful) or ‘bad’ (aggressive).
96 Also Powell (1994: 3200; Zakaria (1998); Schweller (1998).
97  For  Hobbes  the  ‘state  of  nature’  was  fictitious,  a  backdrop  imagination  against  which  an 
ordering  sovereign,  known  as  the  ‘Leviathan’,  could  be  conceptualized.  Realists  build  on 
Hobbes’  suggestion  that  by  overcoming  the  ‘state  of nature’  domestically  this  would  come  to 
characterize  relations  between  states.  For  a  discussion,  see  Doyle  (1997:  116f.);  Beitz  (1999:

60

While  for  most  IR  scholars  the  ‘condition’  of anarchy  is  expressed  in  the  distinction 
between a vertical (hierarchical) organization of the  legitimate use of force within  states 
and a horizontal (’anarchical’) organization among states, the reading here emphasizes a 
different  angle.  It suggests that  on  a  deeper  level  the  ‘condition  of anarchy’  rests  on  a 
certain  (realist)  reading  of the  spatial  and  temporal  situatedness  of states,  namely  the 
reading  that  they  are  autonomous  units  organised  on  the  principle  of  territorial 
exclusivity  (spatial  dimension)  emerging  out  of  a  history  of  conflict  and  facing  an 
uncertain future best engaged with a pessimistic outlook (temporal dimension).

The State in Space: Autonomy as Territorial Integrity
In  a prominent realist  image  states  situated  in the  ‘anarchical  environment’  are  pictured 
like billiard balls (Morgenthau  1960:  174ff). While this metaphor may appear simplistic, 
critics have repeatedly pointed out that beyond such a picture realists lack a theoiy of the 
state.98  For  Wendt (1987),  realism  is  ontologically  primitive.  As  realism  is  interrogated 
here as a ‘deep theory’,  it is worth pursuing John Hobson’s suggestion that realism does 
provide a substantial conceptualisation of the state (Hobson, 2000).

In  general terms,  realists  understand  the  state  to be  a  ‘sovereign’  entity.  Sovereignty of 
course  is  a contested  term  with  a history of different  meanings,99  and  realists  generally 
use  it  synonymously  with  “autonomy”  and  “independence”  (Waltz  1979:  90,  204; 
Grieco  1993:  127;  Mearsheimer 2001:  31).  Thus,  when they  note that  states  are  driven 
primarily 
as  maintaining 
autonomy/independence,100  underlying this  claim  about  what  states  want  is  an  ideal  of 
what  a  state  is,  namely a  non-social  or  ‘atomistic’  unit.  This  ontology  can  be  traced  to 
Hobbes’  conception  of the  individual  as  an  autonomous/independent  being  and  thus  to 
the notion  of individualism  central  to  modem  Western  philosophy  since  Hobbes (Lukes 
2006  [1973];  Doyle  1997:  114).  Realists  project  this  ontology  onto  the  ‘Westphalian’ 
state captured  in Max Weber’s famous definition of the state as “that human community 
which (successfully) claims the monopoly of the  legitimate use of physical  force within 
a  certain  space  [Gebiet]”  (Weber,  1999  (1919):  6,  my  translation;  see  also  Smith,  M. 
1986:  24).  Weber’s  conception  is  echoed  by  Morgenthau,  one  of  the  few  realists

32f.);  Boucher (1998).  The  application  of Hobbes’  ‘state  of nature’  image to  interstate  relations 
has been widely criticized by Ashley (1988); Wendt (1992); Beitz (1999); Hutchings  1999:  19f.).

law-enforcement  (Morgenthau,  1960:  312ff).101  Similarly, 

discussing  the  meaning  of  sovereignty,  who  defines  it  as  ‘supreme  authority’  in  the 
realm  of 
for  Waltz, 
sovereignty  is  about  “being  able  to  decide  for  itself  how  to  cope  with  internal  and 
external problems” (Waltz,  1979: 95).

The  main  challenge  this  ontology  faces  is  interdependence,  that  is,  the  fact  that  no 
decision-making  process  is  completely  autonomous  or  free  from  external  constrains. 
Long before the  phenomenon of interdependence  became prominent in the  literature  in 
the  1970s,  Morgenthau  (1960:  328)  grappled  with  the  fact  that  sovereignty  was  “not 
actual  independence”.  He  acknowledged  that  dependence  of some  states  on  others  in 
military,  economic,  or technological  matters  makes  it  difficult,  or  even  impossible,  for 
them  to  pursue  independent  domestic  and  foreign  policies.  More  recently,  Krasner 
(1999)  in  a  comprehensive  discussion  of the  concept  of sovereignty  shows  how  states 
are  regularly  coerced  into  making  decisions  or  even  invite  their  dependence  through 
voluntary agreements.  Waltz concedes that sovereignty does not mean that the  state can 
do whatever it wants.  While he claims that “to be sovereign and to be dependent are not 
contradictory  conditions”,  Waltz  still  notes  that  sovereignty  understood  as  decision­
making autonomy  is a “bothersome concept”  (Waltz  1979:  95).  After all,  if the concept 
is  a  defining feature  of the  state,  then  one  cannot move too  far away  from  the  fact that 
“sovereignty  is  indivisible”  (Morgenthau  1960:  320).  Differently  said,  if  sovereign 
statehood  is  characterized  by  degrees  of  interdependence,  it  becomes  difficult  to 
conceptualize at what point it becomes existentially threatening.

There are two further ontological implications, downplayed by realists. The first is that if 
sovereignty  cannot  be  fully  claimed  from  within  it  needs  to  be  recognised  by  others, 
which  introduces a  social  component. Notwithstanding repeated violations of the norm, 
in acknowledging that ‘sovereignty’  is a relational attribute realism must compromise its 
atomistic  ontology  of the  state  as  a  non-social  (or  asocial)  entity  (see  also  below).  The 
second  implication  is  that  decision-making  autonomy  understood  as  an  ideal  which 
states  strive  towards  compromises  the  reading  of  the  state  as  a  static  entity.  Said 
differently,  conceiving  of  the  state  as  ‘sovereign-in-the-making’ 
implies  a  tacit 
evolutionary ontology. While the realist literature does grapple with these  issues, visible

101  Morgenthau’s  note  that  the  sovereign  has  “the  responsibility  for  making  the  final  binding 
decision” (Morgenthau  1960:  326) overlaps with Carl Schmitt’s view that the state is the political 
entity which decides the “extreme case” (Schmitt,  1996 [1932]: 43).

62

in  Waltz’  account discussed  below,102 this has  not led realists to  rethink the ontology of 
the state.

Instead,  realists  emphasize  territoriality  and  make  control  over/possession  of  an 
exclusive  territory  the  central  feature  of the  spatial  configuration  of the  state  (Hobson 
2000:  56ff;  Ruggie,  1993).  Carr,  while  acknowledging  that  the  “most  comprehensive 
power  units”  in  international  politics  must  not  necessarily  be  territorially  organized, 
notes that the modem state clearly is based on “territorial sovereignty” (Carr 2001:  210). 
Morgenthau  also  defines  sovereignty  as  “supreme  power  over  a  certain  territory” 
(Morgenthau  1960:  312),  echoed  by  Krasner  who,  while  distinguishing  between  four 
different types of sovereignty,  focuses primarily on  ‘Westphalian  sovereignty’  based on 
“the  exclusion  of  external  actors  from  authority  structures  within  a  given  territory” 
(Krasner,  1999: 4, 20). John Herz perhaps most forcefully argued that territoriality forms 
the  “existential  basis”  for  the  sovereign  state  (Herz  1959:  50),  echoed  in  Gilpin’s 
assertion that “the essence of the state is its territoriality” (Gilpin  1981:  17).

to 

they  are  obviously  central 

Conceptualizing the  state  as  a  certain territorial  space and,  correspondingly,  of survival 
as  maintaining “territorial  integrity” (Mearsheimer 2001:  31) moves analytical  attention 
towards  the  importance  of borders.  Although  realists  don’t  spend  much  time  talking 
about  borders, 
the  notion  of  the  state  as  an 
autonomous/independent entity.  While it is unimportant to realists how communities are 
organised  within  a  certain  territory,  what  matters  is  that  their  authority  to  define  and 
enforce order ends at a physical  border.  Borders are both markers for separating realms 
of authority and protectors of the  same; they divide and compartmentalise the territorial 
surface  of the  planet  and  mark  the  existence  of  ‘states’  as  exclusive  territorial  units. 
While  few might use George Liska’s (1968:  47) words that the  state  is a territorial  unit 
with  natural  boundaries  -  although  Carr  at  one  point  speaks  of how  states  are  built  on 
“rigidly demarcated frontiers” (Carr 2001:  211) -  the very fact that borders are not part 
of realist theorizing is proof that they are assumed to be fixed.

While  this  focus  on  territoriality  makes  for  a  static  ontology  (Ruggie  1998),  it  allows 
realists to pin  down the existential threat.  The elasticity of the meaning of ‘sovereignty’

102  Waltz’  note that “states  seek  to  control  what they  depend  on  or to  lessen  the  extent of their 
dependency”  (Waltz,  1979:  106;  Waltz,  1986:  324)  echoes  the  classification  of states  as  either 
‘satisfied’  or ‘dissatisfied’  (Carr 2001; Morgenthau  1960;  Wolfers,  1962) and also permeates the 
debate  between  ‘defensive’  and  ‘offensive’  realism  and  its  emphasis  on  ‘status  quo’  and 
‘revisionist’  states,  respectively.  See  Snyder  (1991);  Jervis 
(1999);  Taliaferro  (2000); 
Mearsheimer (2001); Schweller (1994,  1998).

makes it difficult to conceptualise when exactly ‘the state’  is existentially threatened, yet 
the  conception  of the  state  as  a  territorial  entity  with  fixed  borders  provides  a  clear 
target.  It  suggests that  survival  is  at risk when  borders  are  permeated  and  the territorial 
integrity of the  state  is violated,  which  happens  in  war.103  To  be precise,  war as such  is 
not threatening but the possibility of losing  is,  and  so the notion of the existential threat 
will  need  to  be  qualified  in  what  defines  this  possibility.  This  crucial  point  is  engaged 
later.

Realist Attempts o f Fixing the State: Learning and Nationalism 
How  does  realism  account  for  the  compartmentalization  of territory  into  units  whose 
autonomy/integrity  governments  are  expected  to  safeguard?  Asked  differently,  how  is 
the spatial  fixation of states as exclusive territorial  entities embedded in an  account of a 
‘condition’  states  are  situated  in?  This  section  reviews  the two  arguments realists  have 
used to justify their ontology, learning and nationalism, and points out their weaknesses.

As expressed  in assumption (4) above, structural realists argue that the sovereign state is 
a  product  of the  dynamic  of interstate  relations  in  the  ‘anarchical  environment’.  They 
portray  the  state  as  what  Hobson  calls  a  “passive-adaptive”  actor  (Hobson  2000)  and, 
thus,  rely  on  a  tacit  learning  argument.  Waltz  most  famously  (and  murkily)  blends 
sociological  and  microeconomic 
logic  carried  forward  through  two  mechanisms, 
socialization and competitive selection, to argue that states have to adjust to  ‘the rules of 
the  game’  if they want to  survive.  He  invokes  Durkheim’s  insight that groups  establish 
norms of behaviour which members conform to (Waltz  1979:  75), remaining quiet about 
where  these  norms  come  from  other  than  vaguely  suggesting  that  “the  persistent 
characteristics  of  group  behaviour  result  in  part  from  the  qualities  of  its  members” 
(Waltz  1979:  76).  Supplementing 
this  rudimentary  socialization  dynamic  with 
microeconomic logic, Waltz translates the market analogy that “competitive systems are 
regulated...by the rationality of the more successful competitors” (Waltz  1979:  76) to IR 
and  suggests that states  will  conform  to  successful  practices  of the most powerful  state 
and that “those who not...will fail to prosper, will lay themselves to dangers, will suffer”

103 This point is made by Morgenthau.  In  a section  entitled  ‘How  Sovereignty  is  Lost’  he argues 
that such  loss occurs when a nation  is placed under the authority of another “so that is it the latter 
that  exercises  supreme  authority  to  give  and  enforce  the  laws  within  the  formers’  territory” 
(Morgenthau  1960: 318). This can take place in two possible ways, namely (i) by giving the other 
nation  veto-power  from  the  outside  or  (ii)  through  the  physical  violation  of territorial  integrity 
which “places the agents of B  above A in terms of lawgiving and -enforcing”,  in other words by 
taking  physical  control  of the  authority  structure  through  occupation  (Morgenthau  1960:  322). 
Ultimately,  ‘civilian’  means do not fundamentally damage territorial  integrity,  only war does,  as 
“it is the very essence of war to penetrate the territory of the enemy” (Morgenthau  1960: 314).

64

Waltz  1979:  118).104  His  notion that  international  structure  “molds agents”  and  thereby 
“causes”  states to  be  alike  by  encouraging  “similarities  of attributes  and  of behaviour” 
(Waltz  1979:  74,  76)  blends socialization and competition to some kind of casual force, 
but  it  also  involves  reflective  activity  on  the  side  of states.  Other  than  in  Darwinian 
evolutionary processes where  selection takes place randomly, Waltz suggests that states 
can come to understand the ‘rules of the game’  and learn to adapt.105

is/should  be.  For  scholars 

When  Waltz asserts that “those who  survive share certain  characteristics” (Waltz  1979: 
77) the question  is whether this refers only to behaviour or to the very understanding of 
what  a  state 
like  Barry  Buzan  structural  realisms’ 
“demonstration  effect”  of  reward  and  punishment  explains  how  life  in  anarchy  “will 
push the range of governmental functions towards sovereignty” (Buzan et al.,  1993:  39). 
This may be giving too much credit to the  ‘logic of anarchy’.  While one may argue that 
the  co-existence  of autonomous  units  creates  a situation  of anarchy (Buzan  et al.  1993 : 
Ch.  4),  and  while  the  condition  of anarchy  encourages  the  practice  of balancing  (see 
below), there  is no compelling  logic  in the realist narrative which  suggests that anarchy 
conditions  states to  be  autonomous,  or desire  autonomy/territorial  integrity.  Waltz does 
not distinguish  between  structure  encouraging balancing and  shaping  states themselves, 
which  masks that the  constitutive argument is  not there.  As  Wendt has  pointed  out,  the 
static  ontology  of  the  state  leaves  structural  realism  without  room  for  processes  of 
socialisation  or evolution  operating  on  the  level  of ontology (Wendt  1987;  1992;  1999; 
also Ruggie  1986).106

The  second  prominent  attempt  of  fixing  the  spatial  configuration  of  the  state  as  an 
autonomous entity  seeking territorial  integrity  is to  point towards  the  constitutive  force 
of nationalism (thus focusing on the community in Weber’s definition). Classical realists 
like  Carr  and  Morgenthau  favoured  ‘the  nation’  as  the  political  entity  whose  relations 
they  studied.  In  his  study  on  the  evolution  of nationalism,  Carr  notes  that  the  state 
merely was “a colourless legal word” (Carr,  1945:  1). Morgenthau identifies nationalism 
as  the  reason  why  the  mass  of  individuals  in  a  society  identify  themselves  with  the 
foreign  policy  wielded  by  small  number  of  people.  He  defines  the  nation  as  “an

Guzzini  (1998);  Inayatullah  and  Blaney  (2004:  Ch.  4).  One  observer notes that the  relationship 
between  ‘self-help’  and  competition  is  underdeveloped,  if not  “fundamentally  flawed”  (Glaser,
1994).

abstraction  from  a  number of individuals  who  have  certain  characteristics  in  common” 
(Morgenthau  1960:  101) and  suggests that there  is  an  inverse relationship  between  “the 
emotional  intensity  of  the  identification  of  the  individual  with  his  nation”  and  the 
stability  and  sense  of  security  within  a  society  (Ibid.,  106).  He  also  argues  that  the 
existence  of a  “national  character”  and  “national  morale”  are  core  elements  of every 
state  with  decisive  influence  on  its vitality (Ibid., 269f).  The  importance of nationalism 
as a cohesive force  is also noted  by structural  realists.  Waltz in Man,  the State and War 
takes up Rousseau’s  point that the unity of the  state  is achieved through  a “public spirit 
or patriotism”,  which  Waltz sees  mirrored  in  the  idea of nationality.  He  even  comes to 
suggest that  “the  centripetal  force  of nationalism  may  itself explain  why  states  can  be 
thought of as  units”  (Ibid.,  174ff;  also Grieco  1990.).  Gilpin  (1981:  14f)  notes the close 
link  between  realist  state-centrism  and  nationalism  and  Mearsheimer  (1990:  18ff  in 
Brown),  mentions  nationalism  as  beliefs  of uniqueness  and  pride  “which  hold  that  a 
nation  should  have  its  own  state”  and  calls  it  a  “second  order  force  in  international 
politics”  (Ibid.,  19;  see  also  Posen  1993).  Buzan’s  conceptualization  of  the  state 
primarily  as  a  “binding  idea”  or  “organizing  ideology”  provides  the  most  elaborate 
discussion among realists of the meaning of ‘national’ security (Buzan  1991: 64,  72-82).

There  is  an  empirical  and  a  conceptual  problem  with  this  argument.  First,  history  is 
replete  with  examples  of nationalism  as  a  force  undermining rather than  strengthening 
‘the state’. The fact that nationalistic sentiments may lead to the disintegration of a state 
does  not fit with a static ontology and  renders nationalism  unsuitable for supporting the 
conception  of  the  state  as  a  geographical  unit  with  fixed  borders.  As  Lapid  and 
Kratochwil  observe,  Buzan  (1991:  72)  is  aware  of this  conceptual  problem  and,  hence, 
does  not  incorporate  nationalism  in  his  subsequent  reformulation  of structural  realism 
(Buzan  et  al.  1993).  Similarly,  the  rudimentary attempts  by  Mearsheimer and  Posen  to 
integrate  nationalism  into  structural  realism  are  highly selective (Lapid  and  Kratochwil, 
1996).  Even if one ignores these inconsistencies, second, from a deep theory perspective 
the  ‘binding  idea’  would  need to  embedded  in  an  account of the  human  condition.  Yet 
realists do not elaborate why a state  is formed around a  ‘national  morale’  or a  ‘binding 
idea’,  why  this  idea  would  be  connected  a  certain  territory,  or when/how  such  an  idea 
may be threatened.

The State in Time: Uncertainty and Experience
While the realist account of anarchy provides no convincing  logic for why states should 
be conceptualized as autonomous/territorially exclusive and  fixed units,  it fares better in 
explaining their desire for a certain  kind of ‘power’  that protects this existence once this

66

ontology  is  accepted.  Notwithstanding the  weakness this  disconnect  brings to  realisms’ 
causal  narrative,  it  is  important  to  look  at  this  account  more  closely  because  it  shifts 
attention  to  the  temporal  dimension  by  emphasizing  (future)  uncertainty  and  (past) 
experience  and  highlights  distrust/pessimism  as  a  central  feature  of  the  realist 
narrative.107

Realists  stress that  because  under  ‘anarchy’  no third  party will  protect  individual  states 
from  arbitrary  violence,  states  live  in  uncertainty.  More  precisely,  they  invoke  the 
Hobbesian  state  of nature  where  individuals  (states)  can  never  be  sure  that  others  will 
not take  advantage  of them  and  therefore  live  in  “continual  fear  and  danger of violent 
death” (Hobbes in Doyle  1997:  114). The key point here is not the states’  situatedness in 
space  as  exclusive  territorial  units  co-existing  without  an  overarching  authority.  The 
absence of a third party arbiter as such does not explain why states fear each other. This, 
states  owe  to their  situatedness  as  reflexive  beings  in  time.  More  precisely,  the  deeper 
reason  is that there  is  no guarantee that agreements made today will  be  respected  in the 
future, that is, there  is no enforcement mechanism which constrains the future behaviour 
of others and makes the future (somewhat) predictable.  States cannot rule out war as the 
existential threat to territorial integrity.

Importantly,  the  threat does  not  stem  from  war per se  but  from  a  particular war which 
holds the possibility of military defeat, that is, of being “conquered” (Mearsheimer 2001: 
3 1).108 This possibility emerges from another state possessing more military capabilities, 
specifically from the possibility that these capabilities are used offensively to invade and 
occupy  the  territory  of  others.  The  notion  of  war  as  a  possibility  is  important  here 
because it clarifies that to say “among states, the state of nature is a state of war” (Waltz 
1979:  103)  does  not  mean that war  is  ongoing but,  rather,  that  it  may  break out  at  any 
point in time. In that sense, the condition foreign policy operates under is marked not by 
war  itself  but  by  the  possibility  of  war,  making  war  as  an  “ever  present”  threat 
(Morgenthau  1960:  9).  As  Carr phrases  it,  war forever “lurks  in  the  background” (Can- 
2001:  102).  Strictly  speaking,  the  language  of the  threat  as  ‘ever  present’  and  in  the 
‘background’  does  not  fully  capture the  logic  within  which  it emerges and that  it  relies 
on a particular understanding ofpast andfuture. This must be looked at more carefully.

107  From  a deep  theorizing perspective,  pessimism  is not grounded in  human  nature,  as  Annette 
Freyberg Inan (2004) suggests, but in an account of the human condition.
108  Morgenthau  points  out  the  difficulty  of  viewing  war  a  ‘common  threat’  when  noting 
“humanity  is  united  in  its  opposition  to  war  as  such,  war  in  the  abstract...[but]  splits  into  its 
national  components  when the  issue  is...a particular war”  (Morgenthau  1960:  267).  States  may 
worry  about the  violation  of the  territorial  integrity  of other  states  if this  leads  to  a  shift  in  the 
balance of power (Snyder  1997: 24)

67

When  realists  emphasise that “uncertainty is given by the  human condition” (Copeland, 
2000:  210) it is important to be clear that there are, strictly speaking, two ways in which 
uncertainty  comes  to  play  out:  the  impossibility  of  knowing  what  others  think  (the 
famous  ‘problem  of other minds’)  and  the  impossibility  of knowing (what  others  think 
in) the future. The two are often conflated in the literature. It is useful to keep them apart 
analytically because the  inability to know the future  is the more crucial  one.  Regardless 
of what the  interests of state Y are today, even  in a state of full transparency and perfect 
information  state  X  cannot  know  what  Y ’s  interests  will  be  like  tomorrow  and, 
consequently, what state Y might do with the military capabilities at its disposal (indeed, 
Y in all likelihood does not know for certain, either). Therefore even states with peaceful 
relations  today  evaluate  each  other  from  the  position  of the  future.  And  because  the 
future is unknown, indeed contingent, the other state’s intention must also be considered 
unknown/contingent.  More  precisely,  for  realists  states  (should)  respond 
the 
unknowability/contingency  of  the  future  with  pessimism,  that  is,  with  a  worst-case 
scenario  based  on  the  possibility  that  the  intentions  of others  might  be  hostile.  They 
argue that states are better off mistrusting each other and frame the relationship as one of 
potential adversaries.109 Pessimist states are states which fear others in the future.

to 

The  concern  that  today’s  friend  might  be  tomorrow’s  enemy  informs  Joseph  Grieco’s 
well-known  argument that  states  worry  about  ‘relative  gains’,  which  he  identifies  as  a 
central  feature of realist logic.  In Grieco’s words, because states are unable to predict or 
readily  to  control  the  future  interest  of  partners,  and  hence  are  “uncertain  about  on 
another’s future  intentions...they  pay  close  attention  to  how  cooperation  might  affect 
relative capabilities  in  the future  (Grieco,  1990:  45,  emphasis  in  original).  This  distrust 
about  future  intentions  makes  them  “acutely  sensitive”  to  any  (anticipated)  erosion  of 
their relative  capabilities  (Grieco  1993:  127).  The  tragic  consequence  of this  logic  was 
famously  laid  out  by  John  Herz,  the  first  IR theorist  systematically  thinking  about  the 
implications  of the  condition  of uncertainty  states  find themselves  in  and  who,  thereby, 
formulated  a  central  element  of the  hard  core  of the  realist  paradigm  (Herz  1951;  see 
also  Booth  and  Wheeler  2008).  Herz  noted  that  states  situated  in  an  anarchical 
environment  respond  to  “uncertainty  and  anxiety  as  to  [its]  neighbours’  intentions”  by 
mistrusting  each  other  and  acquiring  military  means  for  protection  (Herz,  1951:  3).  As 
Waltz summarised the logic “because any state may at any time use force, all states must

109 Herein lies the logical problem realists have with conceptualizing ‘common interests’: because 
assuming the  ‘worst  case’  minimizes  unpleasant  surprises,  for  realists  states  are  (or  should  be) 
pessimists and should always consider interests to be conflicting.

constantly  be  ready  either  to  counter  force  with  force”  (Waltz  2001:  160).  Herz 
famously  captured  the  tragic  consequence  of this  distrust  in  the  notion  of the  security 
dilemma  where  uncertainty  turns  relations  among  states  striving  for  self-preservation 
into  a  competition  for  military  power  (Herz  1951;  Jervis,  1978,  1988;  Booth  and 
Wheeler 2008).

It  is  worth  pointing  out that differences  exist among realists  with  regard to reading the 
future,  observable  in  the  split  between  ‘offensive’  and  ‘defensive’  realism.  The  former 
suggest  that  states  (must)  always  base  their  expectations  on  worst-case  scenarios  and 
follow the logic of “the best defense  is a good offense” by “relentlessly seeking power” 
(Mearsheimer,  2001:  21,  36).  By  contrast,  defensive  realists  argue that  states  are  aware 
of the  potential  danger  of the  spiral  triggered  by  the  security  dilemma  and  hesitant  to 
ever increase their capabilities (Jervis  1999:  4;  Waltz  1979:  126).  Indeed, they hold that 
the  security  dilemma  can  be  eased  by  arguing  that  states  can  make  the  future  more 
predictable  by  taking  into  account  what  Taliaferro  (2000)  has  called  “structural 
modifiers”,  such  as  geography,  signalled  intentions  and/or reciprocal  behaviour.  Hence, 
in  an  important  way  the  disagreement  is  about  the  value  of  present  knowledge  for 
predicting the future; more specifically about what kind of knowledge should  be used to 
deal with uncertainty.

The  important  question  remaining  is:  what  is  this  knowledge  and  where  does  it  come 
from? Hobbes wrote in the Leviathan that the  ‘state of nature’  is a ‘state of war’  because 
the  former  is  a  condition  “wherein  the  will  to  battle  is  sufficiently  known”  (in  Doyle 
1997:  114).  This  makes anarchy a state of war not simply because  of the  absence  of an 
overarching  sovereign  but  because  of a  presence  of ‘sufficient  knowledge’  which,  for 
realists, comes from history.  Worst case scenarios projected  into an uncertain  future  are 
not  invented  out  of thin  air  but,  rather,  view  the  future  through  the  past.  Paradigmatic 
statements  by  realists,  likely  invoking  Thucydides  or  Machiavelli,  cannot  go  without 
pointing  to  the  historical  ‘record’  of conflict  as  a  recurrent  phenomenon,  a  habit  that 
stretches  from  Morgenthau’s  note  that  the  struggle  for  power  is  the  law  of  politics 
“universal  in  time  and  space  and  space  and  an  undeniable  fact  o f  experience” 
(Morgenthau  1960:  33,  emphasis  added)  to  Mearsheimer’s  famous  ‘back  to  the  future’ 
argument  which  predicted  that,  with  the  end  of the  Cold  War,  European  states  were 
likely  to  return  to  competition  and  conflict  (Mearsheimer,  1990).  Colin  Gray  puts  it 
succinctly when noting that for realists “the future is the past” (Gray,  1999).

69

Because  realists  emphasize  a particular  history  as  a  guide  for  reading  of the  future, 
namely the history of violent conflict, or war, the future also is one of violent conflict, or 
war.110  With  emphasis  put  on  ‘recurrent  patterns’  the  temporal  plane  takes  on  the 
appearance  of a  cyclical  view  of history  where  past  and  future  merge  as  the  latter  is 
made  intelligible  by being filled  with  historical  reference  points to which  the  lessons  of 
history can be applied. As Mearsheimer notes, realism not only aims to explain histories 
of conflict but also has a prescriptive element in that “states should behave according to 
the  dictates  of...realism,  because  it  outlines  the  best  way  to  survive  in  a  dangerous 
world” (Mearsheimer 2001:  11, emphasis in original). The result is the image of a world 
-   ‘reality’  -   marked  by  the  possibility  of  violent  conflict,  or  war.  It  follows  that, 
paradoxically,  from  a  realist  perspective  not-knowing the  past  and  applying  its  lessons 
generates the greatest threat to state survival:  ignorance about the  recurrence of conflict 
and/or the belief that the troubled past (read:  conflict) could be  ‘overcome’  is dangerous 
because  it  tempts  governments  to  pursue  policies  blind  to  “the  rational  elements  of 
political  reality”  which  the  past  teaches  (Morgenthau  1960:  8;  Carr,  2001  (1946); 
Morgenthau,  1946; Herz,  1951).

In  sum,  in  the  realist  narrative  the  national  security  interest  forming  in  ‘anarchy’  is 
constituted to a significant degree  in time,  relying of a particular knowledge of the  past 
(as one where conflict arose out of an  imbalance of ‘power’) projected  into an uncertain 
future  (entertaining  corresponding  worst-case  scenarios  which  depict  great  powers  as 
threatening).  Consequently,  the  common  interest  leading  to  cooperation  converges 
around  such  shared  knowledge  of  the  past,  ideally  from  shared  experience,  and 
corresponding  agreement  that  the  correct  use  of  this  knowledge  is  pessimism  about 
others’  intentions.

(II)  Institutionalism: Adjusting Realism
The institutionalist argument was originally developed to explain phenomena in political 
economy and attempts to explain cooperation in the security realm are relatively new.111 
The  label  of  ‘Institutionalism’  also  encompasses  a  variety  of approaches  which  often 
have not much more in common than  emphasizing that  ‘institutions matter’  in the study

110 Carr (2001: 4f) was quite explicit about the emancipatory purposes of theorizing. Morgenthau 
(I960:  8) pointed out that rational  foreign policy as defined by realism  would be “good” foreign 
policy.

of  international  politics.112  Here  it  is  sufficient  to  distinguish  between  two  strands, 
historical  institutionalism  and  neoliberal  institutionalism.  As  the  former  overlaps  with 
social  constructivism,  discussed  in  the  final  section  of this  chapter,  the  main  focus  will 
be on neoliberal  institutionalism.

One  might expect  ‘institutionalism’  to  provide the  most  suitable  explanation.  However, 
as  noted  in  the  first  chapter this  is  not the  case,  for two  reasons.  First,  the  force  of the 
institutionalist argument enters only once common interests among states are assumed to 
exist and offers no argument why interests would drift apart. Related, second, the logical 
thrust  of  the  argument  is  characterized  by  a  path  dependency  bias  ill-suited  for 
explaining the decline  in cooperation (marked  by  investment in  alternative  institutions). 
Thus,  the  institutionalist  causal  narrative  does  not  offer  a  specific  ‘common  interest’ 
shared  by  Germany  and  the  US  cooperate  through  NATO  and  cannot  account  for why 
German  governments  subsequently  invested  in  CSCE  and  CFSP.  As  this  section  will 
show,  these  shortcomings  are  explained  by  the  fact  that  while  institutionalism  offers 
spatio-temporal modifications to the realist reading of the  ‘human condition’,  it remains 
rooted  in the  same and,  from  a deep theory perspective,  does not amount to an  original 
research programme.

The Path Dependency Bias of Historical Institutionalism
An  influential  precursor of and  inspiration  for historical  institutionalism,  still  prominent 
in  European  integration  studies,  is  (neo)functionalism.  Developed  originally  by  Ernst 
Haas  (1958,  1964),  it  suggests  that  shared  institutions  established  in  core  sectors  will 
gradually take on  a  life  on their own  and  push  forward  an  integrative  dynamic through 
unintended  ‘spill-over’  processes.113  Historical  institutionalism  adopts  this  emphasis  on 
the  evolutionary,  indeed  progressive  character  of institutions,114  and  some  even  stress 
socialising  effects  of  institutions  on  their  members  (‘sociological  institutionalism’).115 
The  shared  baseline  of historical  institutionalism  is  a causal  narrative  which  contains  a 
strong  bias  towards  path  dependency  by  emphasizing  that  institutions  or,  rather,  the 
trajectory of their development, are  ‘locked in’  at a certain point in time and then unfold 
from thereon  in a certain direction.  Such  an emphasis may be useful  for explaining how 
institutions  contribute  to  the  persistence  in  cooperation  yet  is  ill  suited  for  explaining

why states choose to create new institutions, even more so if this is framed in terms of a 
degenerating  cooperative  dynamic.  This  weakness  is  reflected  in  the  observation  made 
by  two  prominent  scholars  who  identified  the  emphasis  on  structural  constraints  and 
continuity  as  “a  general  problem  in  contemporary  institutional  analysis”  (Streeck  and 
Thelen 2005:  6).

(1984)  calls  a 

To  be  sure,  state  agency  does  have  a  place  in  the  institutionalist  narrative.  Historical 
institutionalism  emphasises  what  Stephen  Krasner 
‘punctuated 
equilibrium’,  namely an  interruption  of the  institutional  trajectory  as the  moment when 
significant  change  occurs.  These  turning  points,  also  called  ‘historical  junctures’  or 
‘critical  moments’,  open  up  space  for  agency,  indeed  are  defined  by  the  very  fact  that 
agents  are  able  to  influence  the  direction  of institutional  development (e.g.,  Katznelson 
2003).  The  basic  idea  is that there  is  a moment  in time when  institutional  structures are 
weakened  or  break  down,  and  which  thereby  provides  a  window  of  opportunity  for 
agents  to  recreate  or  change  the  institutional  path.  This  perspective  is  buttressed  by 
claims  of policymakers  being  “present  at the  creation”  (Acheson  1969)  and  part  of an 
“architectural  moment”  (Holbrooke  1995:  38)  after  the  end  of  a  major  conflict 
(Ikenberry 2001). Apart from running the tautological risk of reading ‘critical moments’ 
back into events, the problem for the case at hand is how this approach portrays both the 
scale  of the  change  (radical)  and  when  it  happens  (instantaneous).  Picturing  change  as 
major and only during a specific point in time implies that between those rare moments, 
nothing really happens.  When the window  is closed the path  is  locked-in and there  is no 
place for agency and,  hence,  no politics capable of bringing about change. This does not 
fit with the process-perspective taken here which emphasizes gradual change over a long 
period of time.116

Neoliberal Institutionalism: Limits and Openings
As  the  name  suggests,  neoliberal  institutionalism  is  a  mix  of  regime  theory  and 
neoliberal  reasoning  developed  most  coherently  by  Robert  Keohane.117  In  contrast  to 
historical  institutionalism  it gives continuous prominence to state agency.  Emerging out 
of  the  work  he  did  with  Joseph  Nye  on  the  impact  of  economic  interdependence 
(Keohane  and  Nye  1989),  Keohane  challenges  the  realist  view  of the  irrelevance  of

116 For a discussion and critique of the analytical value o f ‘historical junctures’, see Capoccia and 
Kelemen (2007).  Some scholars have called for shifting the analytical focus towards processes of 
continuous/incremental change, see Thelen and Steinmo (1992); Streeck and Thelen (2005). This 
seems similar to Haas’  emphasis on  adaptation  and learning (Haas  1990).  Still, these approaches 
focus on change within institutions, not the creation of new ones and thus does not quite discard 
the path dependency bias.

institutions  and  that  cooperation  would  occur  only  on  a  shallow  and  ‘ad  hoc’  basis, 
arguing  instead that extensive and persistent cooperation  is possible under anarchy even 
without the  presence  of a hegemon  enforcing  commitments  (Keohane  1984:  85f)."8  In 
managing interdependence institutions are neither irrelevant nor simply constraining but 
are  enabling  by  allowing  states  to  cooperate  for  mutual  benefit.  His  basic  argument  is 
that states use institutions to ‘tame’  anarchy.

Like  realists,  institutionalists  like  Keohane  situate  their  theory  in  the  liberal  tradition 
“that  is  rationalistic  and  individualistic  without  being  optimistic  about  human  nature” 
and  accept  the  realist  reading  of the  state  as  an  ‘egoistic’  entity  situated  in  anarchy 
(Keohane and  Martin,  2003:  92f).  They emphasizes the neoclassical  view that states are 
utility  maximizers  with  “consistent,  ordered  preferences”  weighing  alternatives  on  a 
cost-benefit  basis  to  choose  the  one  that  is  more  efficient  in  meeting these  preferences 
(Keohane,  1984:  27).  The notion  of efficiency then  becomes the “driving force”  behind 
the  institutionalist  argument  (Moe,  1984:  743).  The  argument  is  that,  once  common 
interest are known to exist which can be ‘more efficiently’ pursued by working together, 
states strive towards reaching a pareto-optimal  level of cooperation, that is, a level when 
no  (known)  alternative  arrangement exists  that could  make  one  state  better off without 
making the  other worse  off (Keohane,  1984:  51).119  To  achieve  this  level, they  will  set 
up an institution whose primary function it is to reduce the transaction costs arising in an 
anarchy,  mainly  costs  of coordination,  by  providing  ‘reliable  information’  about  each 
other.  Thus,  institutions  are  said  to  be  able  to  alleviate  distrust  by  providing  an 
environment in which credible commitments become feasible.120 The attractiveness of an 
institution  depends  on  its  ability  to  fulfil  this  function,  that  is  on  its  efficiency  in 
“improving  the  informational  environment”  by  providing  mechanisms  which  reduce 
uncertainty (Keohane and Martin, 2003:  80).

The  institutionalist narrative  has two major weaknesses.  First,  its  ‘sunk cost’  logic also 
contains  a  path  dependency  bias  (Keohane,  1984:  Ch.  4;  1988).  This  logic  rests  on  the 
utilitarian  view  that  institutions  are  costly  to  set  up,  so  states  will  not  create  a  new

118  As  Jervis  points  out,  this  question  of how  much  cooperation  is  possible  and  to  what  extent 
institutions can enhance the same was at the centre of the neo-neo debate (Jervis  1999, 2003).
119  As  Milgrom  and  Robert  (1992:  22)  state  it,  pareto-optimality  is  achieved  “if there  is  no 
available  alternative  that  is  universally  preferred  in  terms  of the  goals  and  preferences  of the 
actors involved”.
120  Specifically,  institutions  address  the  risk  of  free-riding  and  cheating  (collective  action 
dilemma),  as  well  as  mistrust  and  information  asymmetries  (security  dilemma),  obstacles  to 
cooperation  identified  in  games  such  as  the  prisoners’  dilemma  (Jervis  1978).  See  also  Moe 
(1984); Keohane (1984).

institution  if an  existing  one  performs efficiently.  In  addition,  the  ‘sunk  cost’  argument 
holds that the choice  between  abandoning an  old  institution  and establishing a  new one 
is  biased.  Because  institutions  are providing increasing returns,  meaning that high  start­
up costs pay off over time, even in the case of temporary inefficiency states are likely to 
stick with the old  institution because the costs of reform are considered lower than those 
of establishing a new institution. As a consequence, states are likely to be biased towards 
keeping  and  reforming  existing  institutions  (Keohane,  1984:  ch.  4;  Keohane,  1988; 
Pierson,  2000).  The  ‘sunk  cost’  factor  holds  that  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  new 
institution would need to be preceded by a clear case of institutional  inefficiency (in this 
case of NATO  and  CSCE,  respectively) and the  ‘cheap’  availability of a more efficient 
alternative.

Here  the  second  and  major  weakness  of  the  argument  arises:  indeterminacy  of  the 
meaning of ‘(in)efficiency’.  Milgrom  and  Roberts  (1992)  point out that  in  applying the 
efficiency  concept  “it  is  necessary  to  be  clear  about  whose  interests  are  counted  and 
what  alternatives  are  considered  to  be  feasible”  (Milgrom  and  Roberts  1992:  22).  An 
evaluation of an  institutions’  efficiency comes down to the question whether it provides 
sufficient  ‘information’  and  satisfies  the  states’  security  interests.  The  theory  does  not 
specify the kind of ‘information’  the  institution must provide beyond the track record of 
past compliance and projecting expected gains and  losses and a pareto-optimal situation. 
Yet  institutionalist logic  says nothing about what the  interests are on the  basis  of which 
future  calculations  are  made.  Like  rational  choice  approaches  more  generally,  interests 
(or ‘preferences’) are plugged into the argument from the outside, they are exogenous to 
the  theory.  While  some  may  see  indeterminacy  in  defining  security  interests  as  an 
advantage  because  it  allows  institutionalism  to  be  more  flexible  in  defining  ‘security 
interests’  depending  on  the  case  at  hand  (Haftendoren  et  al.  1999),  from  a  theoretical 
perspective this  luxury  is  symptom  of the  larger problem  that the  causal  narrative  does 
not go deep enough.

The  reason  institutionalism does not provide a unique reading of (security)  ‘interests’  is 
because  it  does  not possess  a  distinctive  hard  core  but  relies  on  realist  ontology  of the 
state as an  actor striving for autonomy in an anarchical  environment. While at one point 
claiming that it represents a distinct research programme (Keohane and Martin 2003), by 
their own admission this claim  is difficult to uphold. From the earlier claim that the aim 
was “to broaden neorealism” (Keohane and Nye:  1989:  251) to the  later concession that 
“institutionalism  adopt[s]  almost all  of the  hard  core  of realism”  (Keohane  and  Martin 
2003:  73), Keohane’s institutionalism  is not merely a “half sibling of realism” but part of

74

the  realist  family  (Keohane  and  Martin  2003:  81;  Jervis  2003:  280).121  That  said,  the 
institutionalist  argument  offers  two  slight  modification  of  the  realist  account  of  the 
‘human  condition’  (its  reading  of  the  spatio-temporal  situatedness  of  states)  worth 
pointing out.

institutionalism  provides  an  opening 

First, 
in  the  spatial  dimension  by  treating 
interdependence  not  merely  as  an  ontological  inconvenience  but  as  something  that  is 
fundamental  to the  existence  of states.  Highlighting  issue-specific  linkages  across  state 
boundaries and, thus, spaces across borders reaching into domestic structures, the theory 
presents  a  picture  in  which  states  do  not  appear  like  a  billiard  balls  anymore  but  are 
closely  connected.  These transnational  linkages present the  international  as a space that 
is  not  confined  to  the  ‘in-between’  state  borders  and,  thus,  changes  the  perspective  on 
how states relate to each other spatially. Picturing states not as closed  ‘units’  and borders 
not  as  rigidly  separating  but  as  permeable  shifts  the  focus  of  the  spatial  dimension 
towards the transnational  and towards how states manage this condition.  By moving the 
spotlight on  ‘complex  interdependence’  institutionalism  also reveals  new vulnerabilities 
and  avenues  of  influence,  consequently  painting  a  picture  of  more  complex  power 
relations than does realism.

Second,  the  theory  suggests  that  institutions  can  alter  how  states  conceive  of  their 
situatedness  in  time.  Loosely  defined  as  rules,  norms,  and  decision-making procedures, 
institutions  are  not  merely  regulating  interdependence  but  are  providing  information 
which reduces uncertainty and, consequently, tames anarchy (see also Krasner  1982).  In 
an  overlap  with  ‘defensive  realists’,  institutions  are  thus  said  to  function  as  ‘structural 
modifiers’  able to  increase  interstate trust by providing reliable  information  about each 
other’s commitments, thereby changing the  ‘informational environment’ and making the 
future  (somewhat)  more  predictable  (Jervis,  1999;  Keohane  and  Martin,  2003).  By 
stressing  that  function,  the  institutionalist  narrative  recognizes  the  importance  of the 
temporal dimension in the realist argument, yet it does not quite grasp the  latter’s depth. 
It  does 
in  substantiating  the  ‘informational  environment’  on  the  temporal 
dimension  and,  more  specifically,  does  not  address  the  root  of the  realist  (pessimist) 
state of mind, namely that the  reading of the  future  is  based  on  a certain  reading of the 
past as one of recurring conflict.

little 

121  Looking  back,  Keohane  justified  his  adoption  of Waltz’  world  as  a  step  “taken  more  for 
analytical  convenience  and  rhetorical  effect  than  out of deep  conviction”  (Keohane  and  Martin 
2003:81).

(Ill)  Constructivism: Responding to the Postm odern Zeitgeist 
As  noted  in  chapter  one  the  (social)  constructivist  approach  also  has  great  difficulties 
with  explaining  how  two  states  deeply  embedded  in  a  common  institution  could  drift 
apart.  While  this  perspective  likes  to  speak  of ‘states’  and  institutions  co-constituting 
each  other,  it  tends  to  emphasize  processes  of socialization  of the  former  by  the  latter, 
that is,  it emphasizes the influence of institutions in shaping identities and, subsequently, 
interests  of  its  members.  By  suggesting  that  if  only  states  interact  long  enough  and 
within  an  institutionalized cooperative setting they will  internalize collective norms and 
progress towards  an  ever closer union,  it contains  a path-dependency  bias  very  similar 
to  that  of historical  institutionalism.  As  this  section  will  show,  underlying  is  the  same 
neglect of providing an alternative account of the human condition, yet also a promising 
opening by directing attention to ‘identity’.

Like  realism,  constructivism  is  a  broad  church  housing  a  number  of  priests  and 
congregations.  Its  emergence  in  IR  is  often  portrayed  as  a  response  to  the  ‘failure’  of 
realist approaches to come to terms with  the end  of the  Cold  War.  While this  may help 
to explain why constructivism became popular among IR scholars when  it did,  it was not 
meant  to  be  merely  an  explanatory  corrective  to  realism,  filling  the  gaps  so  to  say. 
Rather,  as  part  of the  critical  turn  making  its  way  through  the  social  sciences  in  the 
1980s, constructivism, alongside feminist and postcolonial approaches, emerged out of a 
fundamental  dissatisfaction with  the ontology and  epistemology of the  realist-rationalist 
mainstream.122  This  critical  move  was  stimulated  by  the  philosophical  Zeitgeist  of 
postmodernism  and  the  contours  of the  constructivist  research  programme  developed 
through the intellectual openings this Zeitgeist provided. The meaning of postmodernism 
is difficult to grasp and disputed even among (alleged) proponents, not the least because 
it  depends  on  both  the  underlying  understanding  of  ‘modernity’  and  the  subsequent 
question  of  how  to  relate  to  it  (i.e.  what  the  ‘post’  stands  for).123  In  broad  terms, 
postmodernism designates “a reaction to the monotomy of universal modernism’s vision 
of the world” as “positivistic, technocentric, and rationalistic” and marked by “the belief 
in  linear  progress,  absolute  truths,  the  rational  planning  of ideal  social  orders,  and  the 
standardization  of  knowledge”  (Harvey  1989:  9).  The  postmodern  reaction  combines 
deconstruction  of accepted  categories  and  rejection  of deterministic  thinking  with  the

aim  of  liberating  human  existence  through  the  embrace  of contingency  and  diversity. 
Simply  put,  it  advocates  an  agenda  of emancipation  by  bringing  about  the  “death  of 
meta-narratives” (ibid.).

IR  scholars  stimulated  by  the  postmodern  Zeitgeist  reject  positivist  methodology,  the 
ontology of the  atomistic conception of ‘the  state’  and  a world  where  ideas,  norms, and 
identities  did  not  matter.  Yet  “fracturing  and  destabilizing  the  rationalist/positivist 
hegemony” was  only  “a necessary first step  in  establishing a new  perspective on world 
politics”  (Price  and  Reus-Smit  1998:  263).  While  this  new  perspective,  broadly 
speaking,  is  marked  by  a  shared  commitment  to  ‘reflexivity’  (Adler  2002:  95),  the 
question remains what exactly  ‘reflexivity’ entails and how far it should go.  In the words 
of  Stefano  Guzzini,  following  the  postmodern  invitation  to  “think  the  unthinkable”, 
constructivists  face  the  difficult  task  of engaging  (and  thinking  in)  categories  mainly 
borrowed  from  the  Enlightenment while  having to  invent  new  ones  “to  show  us  a  way 
‘beyond’”  (Guzzini  2000:  152).124  Opinions  diverge  over what  this  way  looks  like  and 
whom to draw on for sign posts.  Following the ‘critical turn’  there have been  ‘linguistic’ 
and  ‘sociological’  ones,  with  inspiration  from  Foucault,  Derrida,  Durkheim,  Parsons, 
Mead,  Giddens,  Bourdieu,  Habermas,  Honneth,  Luhmann,  and  so  on.125  While  this 
makes the  ‘constructivist’  research  programme rather  incoherent,  three  issues  are at the 
heart of the constructivist narrative.

First,  as  the  name  suggests,  constructivists  agree  on  problematising  the  subject-object 
distinction,  that  is,  they  don’t take the  world  as  ‘given’  but  inquire  how  “we  construct 
worlds  we  know  in  a  world  we  do  not”  (Onuf,  1989:  38).  While  ideas,  norms  and 
discourses  are  generally  seen  as  playing  an  important  role  in  this  process,  there  is 
disagreement  among  scholars  on  how  far  the  construction  goes  and,  consequently, 
whether there  is  a  ‘world’  left  outside  mental/discursive  frames.  Some  say there  is  and 
use  a  scientific  realism  frame  to  argue  that  there  are  ‘natural’  and  ‘unobservable’ 
structures  which  affect  our  lives  independent  from  our  thoughts  (Wendt  1999;  Wight 
2006).  For others the crucial question  is not what is  ‘out there’  but how we relate to  ‘the 
world’  and  endow  it  with  meaning,  as  it  is  meaning  that  makes  human  behaviour 
intelligible (Kratochwil  1989). This division also reaches into the reading o f ‘the world’, 
specifically  concerning  the  degree  to  which  it  constructed,  symbolised  in  the  question

124  To  be  sure,  Kant’s  idea  of enlightenment  is  an  invitation  to  critical  thinking and  his  insight 
that knowledge  of reality occurs through  a priori mental  filters  makes him  “the great pioneer of 
constructivism” (Hacking,  1999: 41); Adler (2002: 97f).

the  social  construction  of reality  (Berger  and  Luckmann  1966).  Whereas  the  former 
perspective assumes that there  is a reality that can be understood by everyone and, thus,

Second, with the commitment to reflexivity a central feature of constructivist ontology is 
a focus on  ‘identity’.126  It emphasizes that “identities provide a frame of reference from 
which  political  leaders can  initiate,  maintain, and structure their relationships with other 
states”  (Cronin  1999:  18).  This  is  in  particular  the  case  for  scholars  engaging  with 
security  issues  where,  in  line  with the  notion that “the  issue  of identity...is  inseparable 
from  security”  (Booth,  1997:  88),  constructivists  have  come to  focus  on  state  ‘identity’ 
as  that  (referent  object/subject)  which  needs  to  be  secured.127  However,  as  discussed 
below  in  more detail,  it rarely  is clear what exactly  identity  is, what  it does and  how to 
study  it.  With  becoming  the  analytical  shooting  star  in  the  1990s  identity  was  often 
poorly  conceptualised  and  (over)used  to  explain  all  kinds  of things,  prompting a  much 
noted  critique  by  Rogers  Brubaker  and  Frederick  Cooper  that  ‘identity’  was  used  so 
loosely  that  it  had  become  an  analytically  empty  concept  (Brubaker  and  Cooper 
2000).128  In  IR this  weakness  is  particularly  visible  when  it  comes  to  the  link  between 
identity  and  interests.  In  the  1990s,  the  key  intervention  of  constructivists  against 
‘rationalists’  was  to  assert  that  the  definition  of  ‘interests’ 
is  dependent  on  the 
conception of identity, i.e. that identities ‘constitute’  interests (Wendt  1999; Chafetz et al 
1999).  The rationale behind this assertion is that in order to recognize its interests, a state 
needs to be aware of itself as a subject,  simply put “an  actor cannot know what it wants 
unless  it  knows  what  it  is”  (Wendt,  1999:  231).  Yet  perhaps  because  this  sounds 
intuitively convincing,  constructivists  rarely discuss  in  any  detail  why  and  how  exactly 
identity  ‘constitutes’  interests,  with  the  result  that  identities  and  interests  tend  to  be 
conflated (Reese-Schaefer,  1999).

argue that national  identity  is constituted by some sort o f ‘culture’ (strategic, political, military). I 
find the analytical  value of the culture concept questionable and it is omitted here and throughout 
the thesis,  for a  simple  reason:  any  application  of ‘culture’  in  a  meaningful  way -  other than  a 
vague  catch-all  concept -  requires  specification  of the  determinants  or parameters  making  up  a 
‘culture’, which constructivists suggest are norms and ideas. It makes more sense to jump directly 
to the latter and skip the  ‘culture’  concept as a step  in between that offers little value added..  For 
a critique o f ‘culture’, see Desch (1998) and Campbell (1998a: 217).

Related,  third,  constructivists  like  to  stress  the  ‘mutual  constitution’  of things.  Yet  in 
their  attempt  to  come  to  terms  with  what  Wendt  (1987)  called  the  ‘structure-agency 
dilemma’,  constructivist  reasoning  tends  to  emphasize  structure  over  agency.  While 
early sound bites  like  ‘world of our making’ (Onuf) and  ‘anarchy is what states make of 
it’  (Wendt)  point to  agency,  the  focus  on  norms  and  discourses tempted constructivists 
to  focus  on  the  constitutive  effect  of  structural  forces  at  the  cost  of  accounting  for 
agency and structural change (Sending, 2002).

In  dealing  with  these  issues,  two  constructivist  strands  can  be  identified.129  The  first  is 
that  of  ‘moderate’  (or  thin)  constructivism.  Its  proponents  attempt  to  conceive  of 
constructivism  as  a  ‘bridge’  (Adler,  Checkel)  or  ‘via  media’  (Wendt)  between 
‘reflexive’  and  ‘rationalist’  positions,  a  motivation  which  responds  to  an  influential 
article by Keohane (1988) and spurred what some have called the ‘Third Debate’.130 The 
second  cluster  is  that  of ‘radical’  (or  thick)  constructivism,  or  post-structuralism.  This 
approach remains committed to the critical agenda of piercing through the  ‘mainstream’ 
and  exposing the  ‘power/knowledge nexus’  (Foucault),  hence regards  attempts to  speak 
with  realists/rationalists  as  ‘selling  out’  (Behnke;  Zehfuss;  Campbell).  While  more 
‘genuine’  from  a  postmodern  perspective,  the  radical  agenda  to  reveal,  resist  and 
emancipate  makes  it  ill  suited  for  devising  a  theory  of  interstate  cooperation.  Any 
attempt to establish  a causal  narrative  in the deep theory sense  inevitably risks  stepping 
into  the  ‘enlightenment  trap’,  that  is,  it  risks  claiming  a  higher  access  to  truth  and 
thereby  becomes  part  of the  very  power/knowledge  nexus  the  radical  strand  seeks  to 
undermine.  Hence, the  following focuses on the  ‘moderate’  strand  and  primarily on the 
work of Wendt (1999; also  1992;  1994;  2003), which comes closest to presenting a deep 
theory, as well as Adler and Barnett (1998) and Cronin (1999).

The Weakness of Moderate Constructivism
In  line  with  the  postmodern  Zeitgeist,  starting  point  is  a  critique  of realism’s  static/re­
productive  conception  of interstate  relations  and  its  alleged  material  and  individualistic 
ontology.  Drawing  on  ideas  of Haas  (1958)  and  Deutsch  et  al.  (1957),  the  moderate 
constructivist  narrative  maintains  that  interstate  relations  are  social  and  structured  to  a

129 This  is close to the distinction made by Hopf (1998) and Wendt (1999).  For slightly different 
categorisations, see Price and Reus-Smit (1998); Adler (2002).

significant  degree  by  ideas  and  that  ideas  change  (through)  the  dynamic  of  social 
relations.131

Strictly  speaking,  Wendt’s  theory  is  not  about  cooperation  but  about  three  different 
kinds of interstate systems and about the (unidirectional) process of moving from  one to 
another.  Specifically,  Wendt  argues  that  different  ‘political  cultures’  or  ‘logics  of 
anarchy’  may  develop  between  states  which,  borrowing  English-school  typology,  he 
describes as (i) a Hobbesian culture ruled by fear of war, where states see each other as 
enemies, (ii) a Lockian culture regulated  by mutual respect for the  right of sovereignty, 
where states considered each other rivals, and (iii) a Kantian culture in which states have 
ruled  out  war  as  a  conflict-solving  tool  and  identify  each  other  as  friends.  Although 
cooperation can occur in all of these settings, the move from one system into another not 
only  describes  a  shift  towards  different  kinds  of  cooperation  but  also  a  process 
establishing  conditions  for  ever  closer  cooperation  (more  peaceful  relations).  Drawing 
on  theories  of symbolic  interact ion ism  and  Haas’  neofunctionalism,  Wendt  argues  that 
relations progress from Hobbesian to Kantian through a process of learning in the course 
of  which  mutual  trust  is  being  built  through  the  gradual  internalisation  of  shared 
knowledge (norms) (Wendt 1999: Ch. 6 and 7).132

This  argument resonates  with  the  one  by  Emanuel Adler and Michael  Barnett’s  (1998) 
that  interstate  relations  undergo  an  evolutionary dynamic bringing them  from  ‘nascent’ 
to  ‘mature’  security communities  (Adler and  Barnett  1998:  48ff).  Building on  the  work 
by  Karl  Deutsch,  Adler  and  Barnett  also  emphasise  the  creation  of shared  knowledge 
through  ‘social  learning’  brought  about  by  increased  transactions  and  communication, 
which  over  time  establishes  “’we  feeling’,  trust,  and  mutual  consideration”  through 
“partial  identification  in  terms  of self-images  and  interests”  (Deutsch  et  al.  1957:  36). 
Adapting  the 
institutionalist  perspective  outlined  earlier,  Adler  and  Barnett  see 
institutions  as  providing  trust-enhancing  mechanisms,  as  sites  of  interaction  where 
learning  occurs  and  as  creative  forces  through  which  states  develop  “dependable 
expectations of peaceful  change”.  They also suggest that  ‘power’  plays a crucial  role  in 
the  formation  of security  communities  with  a  ‘core  state’  serving  as  a  ‘magnet’,133  yet 
apart  from  noting  that  such  power  is  exercised  via  “positive  images”  and  expectations 
about  “benefits”  associated  with  the  community  they  don’t  elaborate  on  the  nature  of

131  See also Ruggie (1993); Reus-Smit (1998); Hall (1999).
132 For a different adaptation of the English School typology, see Buzan (2004).
133  This  stands  in  contrast to  Wendt’s narrative,  where  ‘power’  is  understood  in  realist terms  as 
military  capabilities  and  becomes  increasingly  mediated  by  ideas  and  thus  irrelevant  for 
structuring relations.

this magnet and  how it works (Adler and  Barnett  1998,  33-45).  Finally,  Bruce Cronin’s 
(1999)  narrative,  which  falls  between  the  above  two,  offers  a  slightly  more  complex 
typology  of six  different  security  arrangements ranging  from  one  where  cooperation  is 
based  on  a  balance  of  power  logic,  expressing  interstate  relations  characterised  by 
hostility,  to  a  highly  institutionalised  system  of  collective  security,  characterised  by 
symbiosis (Cronin  1999,  Ch.  1).  His  argument explaining their formation  relies  less  on 
social  learning  and  more  on  symbolic  interactionism  and  Social  Identity  Theory  (also 
Mercer  1995),  which  describes  collective  identity  formation  through  an  ‘ingroup’  vs. 
‘outgroup’  dynamic,  a  point  downplayed  by  Wendt  and  only  hinted  at  by  Adler  and 
Barnett (Cronin  1999: 2 Iff).

Taken  together,  the  moderate  constructivist  ‘signature  argument’134  emerging  out  of 
these narratives is that ongoing interaction within  a common  institution  leads  states (via 
some process o f ‘learning’) to share knowledge and a social/collective identity which,  in 
turn,  moves them  to  closer/improved  cooperation.  From  a deep theory  perspective,  this 
argument has  two  key  weaknesses  reminiscent of those  faced  by  institutionalism  noted 
earlier.

The  first  weakness  is  that  the  ‘common  interest’  setting  off  this  dynamic  is  neither 
specified  nor theoretically accounted  for.  Adler and  Barnett (1998:  38)  mention a range 
of  factors  leading  to  the  crucial  first  cooperative  agreement  from  which  security 
communities  evolve.  They  overlap  with  what  Wendt  (1999:  343ff.)  calls  ‘efficient 
causes’,  namely (economic)  interdependence,  a  shared  threat  (what  he  labels  ‘common 
fate’)  and  homogeneity  (in  language,  domestic  institutions,  etc.),135  and  with  Cronin’s 
(1999:  32f.)  suggestion  that  a  common 
identity  forms  on  the  basis  of  shared 
characteristics “salient to a society’s self-understanding”, exclusivity and a high  level of 
‘positive interdependence’. These factors either repeat realist/institutionalist reasoning or 
come close to  a tautology;  in  any case they don’t hang together and  remain outside the 
causal  narrative offered  by constructivists.  The  lack of a theoretically grounded account 
for  what  sets  off the  cooperative  dynamic  is  the  price  paid  for  holding  that  (shared) 
identity  constitutes  (shared)  interests,  which  consequently  means  that  the  ‘factors’ 
generating a shared  identity cannot be  ‘interests’  as this would spark the question where 
these come from  if not from  ‘identity’.  The  above  authors  do not address  this  question,

1341 take this term from Wohlforth (2008) who uses it for realism.
135 Wendt also mentions self restraint as a  ‘permissive cause’, which is said to enhance trust.  For 
a critique, see also Kratochwil (2000).

81

thereby exposing the murky conceptualization of the link between identities and interests 
in the constructivist narrative.

Cronin’s  reminder  that  the  above  ‘factors’  only  provide  favourable  conditions  as  a 
shared  identity  is  created  through  common  experience  “of  high  intensity  and  long 
duration”  (Cronin  1999:  33)  does  not  solve  the  problem.  While  an  interesting  avenue, 
this  argument  is  not  theoretically  grounded  in  anything  other  than  a  reference  to  the 
integrative  dynamic  of  ‘continued 
interaction’  also  emphasized  by  Wendt  and 
Adler/Barnett.  Moreover, if this interaction is occurring within common institutions, this 
puts  the  latter on the wrong end  of the  causal  narrative.  Rather than  using an  ‘identity’ 
lens  to  highlight  a  specific  interest  leading  to  investment  in  a  certain  institution,  the 
moderate  constructivist  narrative  points  the  causal  arrow  from  institutions  to  identities 
and, by extension, interests.

This  feeds  into the second weakness: the narrative  lacks an  account of what undermines 
a  shared  identity  and,  hence,  what  weakens  the  common  interest  keeping  cooperation 
alive. Tailored towards explaining phenomena of increasing (or improving) cooperation, 
the  causal  narrative  is  not  only  one  of process  but  also  of progress.  Although  strictly 
speaking ‘interaction’  is not necessarily cooperation (see chapter one), without making a 
clear distinction between the two the argument that ongoing interaction has a socializing 
effect  suggests,  crudely put,  that cooperation  leads to more cooperation  in  some sort of 
self-reinforcing  mechanism.  This  undisturbed  causal  link  between  cooperation  and 
socialization inserts a ‘socialization bias’  into the constructivist narrative and forestalls a 
substantial  argument for reversal/breakdown of cooperative relations. And it exposes the 
flipside  of constructivism’s departure from the realist definition  of the common  interest 
as  constituted  by  a  shared  threat,  namely  a  lacking  conceptualisation  of  a  threat  to 
‘identity’  altogether.136  As  a  result  of merging  Durkheim’s  emphasis  on  structure  with 
the  integrationist logic of Deutsch  and Haas, both Wendt (1999:  321) and Adler/Barnett 
(1998:  49) explicitly acknowledge the path dependency and unidirectional thrust of their 
argument (see also Wendt 2003).137 And while Cronin takes a slightly different approach 
by suggesting that cooperative arrangements are made/changed during “periods of social 
upheaval” (Cronin  1999:  37),  his  ‘punctuated  equilibrium’  contains the  same  weakness

136 This is discussed in more detail in chapter seven.
137  Adler  and  Barnett  only  pay  lip  service  to  the  possible  ‘reversal’  of the  dynamic,  not  going 
beyond the suggestion that “the same  forces that ‘build up’  security communities can  ‘tear them 
down’”  leaving  the  reader  in  the  dark  as  to  how  exactly  this  is  supposed  to  work  (Adler  and 
Barnett  1998: 58).

as institutionalism’s ‘historical juncture’ approach noted earlier and, in any case, he does 
not discuss what undermines transnational identities.

The ‘Identity’ Problem
From  a  deep  theory  perspective,  behind  the  two  above  weaknesses  lies  the  failure  of 
moderate constructivists to formulate an  original  account of the human condition which 
explains why  states  seek  an  ‘identity’  and  lays out the  parameters  making up the  latter. 
This  becomes  apparent  when  taking  a  closer  look  at  how  constructivists  like  Wendt 
conceptualize ‘identity’.

Constructivists  argue  that  ‘identity’  has  an  ‘internal’  (or  individual/personal/reflective) 
and  an  ‘external’  (collective/social)  dimension.138  This  insight  is  taken  from  social 
psychology  and  traceable  to  the  famous  distinction  between  ‘I’  and  ‘Me’  made  by 
George  Herbert  Mead  (1934).  Mead  argues  that  Self-fulfilment takes  place  through  an 
evolutionary  process  in  which  the  acting  Self,  the  ‘I’  driven  by  intuition  and  instinct, 
comes to  internalize the  “attitude  of the whole community”,  devising the  sense of ‘Me’ 
gained  by  adapting  to  a  social  group  (Mead  1934).  The  difficulty  is,  however,  to 
conceptualize  the  ‘internal’  and  the  ‘external’  dimension  and  their  relationship  beyond 
asserting that they are ‘co-constituted’. This is difficult because, as Heidegger points out, 
the very notion  o f ‘identity’  contains  an  insolvable tension  in  meaning both  ‘similarity’ 
and  ‘distinctiveness’ (Heidegger  1957/1969).

This tension bedevils all  ‘identity’  based arguments and  invites the  incoherent and often 
contradictory  use  of  ‘identity’  pointed  out  by  Brubaker  and  Coopers.  Constructivists 
struggle  with  how  to  balance  this  dual  nature.  It  is  one  thing  to  say  that  “the  self- 
identification  of  individuals...is  in  part  defined  in  terms  of  their  participation  in  a 
collective  identity”  and  that  “individual  identity  acquires  social  significance  only  with 
reference to the  identities of others” (Hall  1999:  34fi), but what exactly does this mean? 
Scholars  who,  implicitly  or  explicitly,  treat  the  state  like  a  person  read  the  ‘internal’ 
somehow into the state and attribute the  ‘external’  or social/collective source of identity 
to  some  notion  of international  ‘community’  or  ‘group’,  that  is,  they  remain  vague  on 
how  to  conceptualize  the  ‘internal’  source  of a  states’  identity  and  specifying  (how  it 
relates to) the ‘external’.

138  Bloom  (1990);  Wendt  (1994,  1999);  Mercer  (1995);  Risse-Kappen  (1995);  Weller  (1999); 
Hall (1999); Bially Mattem (2005).

83

Yet  the  question  if and  how  the  T   has  any  influence  on  the  kind  of  ‘community’  or 
‘group’  from  which  the  social/collective  identity  is  obtained  is  a  crucial  one  for  the 
constructivist  narrative,  as  choosing  to  cooperate  (or  not)  and,  thus,  to  conceptualise 
change within cooperative relationships requires some sort of standard against which the 
value  of  this  relationship  is  assessed.  For  a  causal  argument  explaining  change  in 
external  relations,  it  thus  makes  sense  to  move  analytical  attention  to  the  ‘internal’ 
source o f ‘identity’. Otherwise one  is  left with a purely social ontology in which  ‘states’ 
are  defined  exclusively  through  a  relation  setting  and  turn  into  cultural  dupes  who 
merely take on a designated  ‘role’ following a given script. While identities and interests 
must to some degree be internally generated to provide the state with agency, addressing 
this  ‘internal’  dimension/source is not easy.  Indeed, shunned by the anti-foundationalism 
of  the  postmodern  Zeitgeist  and  neglected  by  the  structural  reasoning  of  a  neo- 
Durkheimean ontology which assumes that all construction must be social,  it tends to be 
ignored.139

To  his  credit,  Wendt tries  to  balance  the  ‘internal’  (or  personal)  and  the  ‘external’  (or 
social)  dimension  of ‘identity’  and  keep  a  place  for agency.  When  defining  identity  as 
“an  actor’s  self understanding”  (Wendt  1999:  224)  he  does  not  assume that the  Self is 
necessarily  defined  in  relation  to,  and  consequently  involves  the  conception  of,  an 
‘Other’,  which  allows  him  to  maintain  an  ‘individualistic’  element  in  his  ontology. 
Unfortunately,  despite 
the 
conceptualisation  of the  state,  at  closer  look  Wendt’s  solution  to  the  structure-agency 
dilemma is complicated on the surface but unoriginal underneath.140

inserting  a  multifaceted 

reading  of  ‘identity’ 

into 

Wendt and the ‘Essential State’
Wendt defines identity vaguely as “a property of [states] that generates motivational and 
behavioural  dispositions”  (Wendt  1999:  224).  This suggests that  identity  is  something a 
state can possess, which logically gives the latter an ontological status independent from 
‘identity’,  a  move  which  will  become  clear  once  the  discussion  proceeds.  Yet  how  or 
why  this  ‘property’  generates  motivational  dispositions  remains  unclear.  This  gets 
brushed  over  by  the  suggestion  that  interests  are  constituted  by  ideas  (Wendt  1999: 
113ff),  which  in turn  are  seen  as  embedded  in  ‘culture’  defined  as  ‘shared  knowledge’ 
(Wendt  1999:  141,  157ff).  It  is  hence  not  ‘identity’  but this  ‘shared  knowledge’  which 
does the heavy lifting in Wendt’s causal narrative. It deceptively replaces the notion of a

139 As Cedermann  and Daase (2003,  fh.  5) note,  ‘Meadian  identity theory’  also tends to focus on 
the ‘Me’ while leaving the ‘I’  undertheorized.

‘common  interest’  and  leaves  ‘identity’  as  a  conceptual  funnel  through  which  ‘shared 
knowledge’  is channelled into behaviour.

This  emphasis  on  ‘knowledge’  also  guides  Wendt’s  conception  of the  essence  of ‘the 
state’.  In an attempt to offer an ontology which  integrates the  ‘internal’  (individualistic) 
and the  ‘external’  (holistic),  Wendt conceptualises the  state  as an  entity possessing four 
kinds of identities  (collective,  role,  type,  corporate).  These  can  be  seen  as  situated  on  a 
spectrum  ranging  from  as  exclusively  social 
to  entirely  pre-social 
(corporate).  For Wendt these  ‘identities’  are hierarchically organised, with the corporate 
one designating the  ‘essential  state’, a platform on which everything else is built (Wendt 
1999:  224-231).141  It  is  described  as  the  states’  ‘body’,  endowed  with  five  ‘essential 
properties’  which  taken  together  echo  the  realist  conception  of the  state  (Wendt  1999, 
Ch. 5,  197).142

(collective) 

Two  properties  stand  out,  namely territory  and  society (Wendt  1999:  225).  In  line  with 
his  critique  of Waltz’  ontology  as  static  Wendt tries  to  portray  these  properties  as  not- 
fixed.  Hence,  he  notes  that the  territorial  base  can  have  “fuzzy”  boundaries  and  whose 
meaning  can  vary  and  that  states  may  include  others  “cognitively”,  thereby  making 
territorial borders less  ‘rigid’  or exclusive (Ibid., 212, see also Cronin  1999:  21). Yet the 
core  of his ontology is society,  loosely defined  as “people with  shared  knowledge”, and 
with  the  crucial  qualification  that  this  knowledge  is  “self  organizing”  (Wendt  1999: 
209).  It is this notion of a self-organizing structure o f ‘private knowledge’  as something 
unique  holding  society  together  which  makes  the  state  essential.  He  distinguishes  this 
‘stock of knowledge’  from knowledge gradually shared beyond territorial borders, which 
he  calls  ‘common  knowledge’  making up the  ‘micro-structure’  of specific  relationships 
and  ‘collective  knowledge’  constituting  the  ‘macro  structure’  of the  system  (Wendt 
1999:  147ff,  159ff.).

Apart  from  the  crucial  question  why  and  how  knowledge  is  shared  amongst  states  and 
how it relates to the domestic ‘stock of knowledge’ -  according to Wendt the two are not 
necessarily  connected  (Wendt  1999:  249,  257)  -   Wendt  does  not  specify  what  this 
‘knowledge’,  in  particular  this  private  knowledge  making  up  that  self-organizing 
structure  of the  state,  is about and  where  it  comes from.  He  only vaguely  suggests that

141  In his earlier writings he relied on Giddens’  structuration theory which puts forward the notion 
of mutual constitution in a ‘moment of structuration’  (Giddens  1984).
142  Wendt (1999:  201-214) discusses the following properties:  (i)  an  institutional-legal  order (ii) 
an  organization  claiming  a  monopoly  on  the  legitimate  use  of  organized  violence,  (iii)  an 
organization with sovereignty, (iv) a society and (v) territory.

the shared knowledge is an effect of state policy or “wellfed]  up from the ‘bottom’ of the 
human  experience”  and  elsewhere  speaks  of the  importance  of an  ‘idea  of the  state’ 
rooted  in  collective  memory,  myths  and  traditions  which  allows  society  to  “acquire 
continuity  through  time”  (Wendt  1999:  209;  218,  163;  see  also  Wendt  2004).  These 
thoughts, which  hint at the temporal  situatedness of the  state,  are neither elaborated  nor 
substantially integrated into the theory (also Cronin  1999).

This  makes  Wendt’s  conceptualization  of  the  states’  ‘S elf  as  a  ‘self-organizing 
structure’  ontologically  incomplete.  Against  the  view  that  understanding  oneself  as 
unique and distinct requires a social  setting providing a standard of comparison (Cronin 
1999:  24),  Wendt  argues  that  the  ‘self  organizing  structure’ 
is  like  a  body  (of 
knowledge, presumably) and that “having a body means you are different than  someone 
else’s  body,  but  that  does  not  mean  that  his  body  constitutes  yours  in  any  interesting 
way” (Wendt  1999:  225). This defense  is weak not only because  its appeal  relies on the 
metaphor of a human  ‘body’  as  a self-organizing biological  organism, which  cannot  be 
applied  to the  state,  as Wendt himself recognizes.  He  concedes that what really matters 
is not the  body but “a consciousness and memory of Self’ (Ibid.). But,  again, this claim 
is  not followed  up.  Substantiating  it would  require  discussing what constitutes  a states’ 
self-consciousness,  how  it  is  organized  and  why  society -  which  always  slips  in  when 
Wendt talks about the state as having a consciousness -  develops a (collective) mind-set 
isolated from others/the world. Yet Went does not offer such an argument.143 There is no 
discussion  of  how  to  study  a  states’  consciousness,  that  is,  how  the  ‘structure  of 
knowledge’  is generated, what its parameters are and how its boundaries are drawn.

Thus,  despite  all  the  claims  to  the  contrary,  in  Wendt’s  picture  ‘the  essential  state’ 
appears  like  a  stable  and  isolated  something.144 
Instead  of  providing  a  theoretical 
narrative with a novel ontology and a corresponding conception of (security)  interest,  in 
the  end  Wendt’s  discussion  of the  state  as a  ‘person’  only  serves to justify defining the 
‘national  interest’  with  reference to familiar basic  needs:  survival,  autonomy, economic 
well-being,  and  self-esteem  (in that order).  With  the  possible  exception  of the  last one, 
there  is  no  sign  that  these  interests  are  generated  by  identity  or  ideas  or  in  any  way

143  Wendt (2006) recognised this as being the central problem of his theory and  is working on a 
new one that focuses on consciousness through Quantum theory.
144  His  insistence that his theory  is  not concerned with  “state  identity  formation”  (Wendt  1999: 
11)  nor  with  offering  a  “theory  of the  state”  (Wendt  2006:  208)  looks  odd  alongside  an  entire 
chapter  on  the  state,  including  an  extensive  conceptualisation  of state  identities  (Ch.  5),  and  a 
lengthy discussion of identity formation (317ff.).

them to ‘human nature’ (Wendt  1999:  13If., 233-38).

Openings and Limits
The constructivist narrative of interstate relations as a dynamic space under construction 
opens  up  a  view  on  interstate  relations  through  an  evolutionary  ontology  and  contains 
some useful conceptual openings in terms of both space and time.

Whether Wendt’s  ‘political culture’, Adler and  Barnett’s collective  identity, or Cronin’s 
shared  social  identity,  all  these terms capture  a transnational  conception  of space.  They 
go  beyond  the  institutionalist  insight  that  territorial  boundaries  are  more  porous  than 
realists  would  like  to  have  them  by  noting  that  the  meaning/significance  of territorial 
borders depends on the social  setting and that they can  be cognitively transcended.  This 
reading  of  borders  is  captured  in  Wendt’s  notion  of  ‘fuzzy’  boundaries  and  most 
explicitly  in  Adler’s  notion  of  ‘cognitive  regions’,  which  is  echoed  in  the  view  of 
“communities  developing]  around  networks,  interactions,  and  face-to-face  encounters 
that  are  not  dependent  on  inhabiting  the  same  geographic  space”  (Adler  and  Barnett 
1998:  33;  Adler  1997;  also  Cronin  1999).  The  formation  of  ‘collective  identities’ 
through  ‘common knowledge’ thus also can be seen as bringing states closer together, as 
thickening the shared space and replacing, or reducing, the  ‘inter’  as a separating realm. 
The  ‘inter’  may  not  cease  to  exist  but,  rather,  becomes  a  shared  space  that  means 
something  to  the  states  evolving  under  this  ‘collective  identity’.  The  interdependence 
which  challenged  realist  ontology  is  thus  fully  incorporated  into  the  narrative  as  a 
positive ontological force.

But  then,  as  we  have  seen  the  ontology  is  not  transnational  ‘all  the  way  down’.  In 
correspondence  with  his  notion  of the  ‘essential  state’  Wendt  does  not  challenge  the 
assumption  of the  state  as  autonomy-seeking.  Although  his  ‘Kantian  culture’  has  the 
potential  to  break with  this  conception,  this  potential  is  not  realized  as  Wendt ends the 
discussion  by  advocating a rethinking of the  state  and  interstate  relations (Wendt  1999: 
307f).  Adler  and  Barnett  assert  that  “domestic  characteristics  and  practices”  must  be 
“consistent with the community” (36), yet at the same time they shy away from adopting 
a  thorough  transnational  perspective  by  focusing  on  ‘pluralistic  security  communities’ 
where  states  maintain  their  ‘sovereignty’  (Adler  and  Barnett  1998:  5).  While  Cronin 
goes  furthest  in  empirically  substantiating the  formation  of ‘transnational  identities’  in 
an  analysis  of  the  formation  of  the  German  and  Italian  statehood  as  a  merging  of 
formerly separate  ‘entities’,  he does  not underpin this theoretically with  an  ontology of

87

‘the state’  which would allow for such a merger to occur.  Hence,  implicitly or explicitly, 
the  narratives  of transnationalism  are  carried  out  on  the  back  of the  conception  of the 
state as a sovereign entity (also Risse-Kappen  1995;  Bially Mattem 2005).

This  fall-back  on  realist  ontology  has  been  criticized  by  radical  constructivists,  who 
targeted  in particular Wendt’s essentialist reading of identity and,  hence, of the state. As 
David  Campbell  (1998) and  Maja Zehfuss  (2001) highlight, the assumption  of the  state 
as  possessing  a  fixed/corporate  identity  -  a  fixed  understanding  of Selfhood  based  on 
stable  ‘properties’  -   fails  to  pay  sufficient  attention  to  the  phenomenon  of  identity 
politics.  They  persuasively  show  that  identity  claims  are  contested  and  manipulated 
within  society  and  that,  therefore,  an  analysis  seeking  to  understand  how  ‘identity’ 
influences  state  interests/policy  must  take  into  account  the  domestic  political  struggle 
over  claims/representation  of  a  certain  ‘identity’,  specifically  the  construction  of the 
‘Other.  Hence,  for  both  Campbell  and  Zehfuss  the  state  is  not  a  unitary/stable  entity 
whose Selfhood is defined in isolation from the world, but something that exists only by 
constantly  (re)instating  ‘its’  borders,  always  “in  the  process  of  becoming”  through 
practices  of representation  of Otherness  and  the  construction  of boundaries  (Campbell 
1998:  12).145  Wendt’s response to this critique that IR scholars only need to know which 
understanding  ‘wins’  the  domestic  debate  is  unsatisfactory,  not  the  least  because  it 
blocks out the role of transnational  links in bringing this  ‘victory’  about.146

The dynamic perspective brings the temporal dimension into the moderate constructivist 
narrative. Although insufficiently spelled out, the notion that collective identities and the 
‘shared knowledge’ they are based on are ‘sticky’  suggests that they reach into the future 
and  reduce uncertainty.  More precisely, the  socialisation  process  marked by an  increase 
in  ‘shared  knowledge’  of what Cronin  calls “constitutive rules”  is assumed to affect the 
expectations  states  hold  towards  each  other.  According  to  the  progressive  narrative, 
these expectations are changed positively, creating relations marked by increased mutual 
trust, with trust defined  as “believing despite uncertainty” (Adler and Barnett  1998:  46). 
In  the  constructivist  narrative  the  content  of  this  belief  depends  on  the  ‘stage’  the 
relationship 
‘mature’  security 
community  and  Cronin’s  collective  security  systems  all  have  in  common  that  its 
members come to believe that the other will not attack them at any time and, hence, have

‘Kantian  culture’,  Adler/Barnett’s 

is 

in.  Wendt’s 

145 The role of the ‘Other’  in the formulation of the Self will be discussed in detail  in Chapter 6.
146 Here  Wendt’s thinking also appears  stifled by the attempt to  maintain  Waltz’  ‘foreign  policy 
versus IR theory’ distinction.

88

a  shared  reading  of the  future  as  something other than  war,  also  contained  in  Cronin’s 
suggestion that states rally around a notion of “common good” (Cronin,  1999:  131).

Yet  the  notion  that  shared  knowledge  plays  a  key  role  in  managing  the  temporal 
situatedness  of the  state  already  reads  more  into  the  constructivist  narrative  than  most 
authors  care  to  do.  Indeed,  when  looked  at  closely,  the  constructivist  engagement  with 
the temporal dimension  is rather limited. Notably,  Wendt’s discussion  of the Hobbesian 
culture  does  not  even  address  the  problem  of uncertainty/contingency  and  the  cyclical 
view of history emphasised by realists (Wendt,  1999:  250ff). The relevance of symbolic 
interaction  for  creating  shared  expectations  reads  like  an  extension  of  game  theory, 
where future uncertainty is reduced through expected reciprocity based on “some degree 
of long-term  interest derive[d]  from  knowledge of those  with  whom  one  is  interacting” 
(Adler and Barnett  1998:  31).  Yet because the causal narrative does not go deep enough 
in  specifying  what  kind  of  knowledge  states  come  to  share  and  how  it  matters.  The 
‘shared  knowledge’  binding states together is not specified  beyond  ‘norms’,147 and even 
if one  accepts  that  the  internalisation  of the  same  norm(s)  increases  states  abilities  to 
‘know’  each other, the argument that this affects  how states conceive of (each other  in) 
the future is reduced to the assertion that norms are  ‘sticky’ without specifying what that 
means,  or  why  such  is  the  case.  More  precisely,  preoccupied  with  how  norms  are 
‘internalized’  through  processes  of  interaction,  the  moderate  constructivist  narrative 
does  not  sufficiently  engage  the  role  of the  past or  specify  why  and  how  norms  matter 
for the  future.  An  over-reliance on the  guiding function  of norms,  a function  they  seem 
to  possess  simply  by  being  ‘norms’,  brushes  over the  issue  of contingency  emphasized 
not  only  be  realists  but  also  by  the  postmodern  Zeitgeist  and  leaves  it  insufficiently 
integrated in the constructivist narrative.

At  bottom,  these  limits  are  symptoms  of the  fundamental  weakness  of the  moderate 
constructivist ‘research programme’  or, rather,  its attempt to represent one.  Despite their 
seemingly radical  shift towards focusing on  ‘identity’,  moderate constructivists (at  least 
those discussed  in  this chapter) don’t provide an  alternative to the  ontology of the  state 
employed  by  realism  and  the  corresponding  understanding  what  states  want.148  They 
don’t  succeed  in  substantiating the  concept  of (collective)  ‘identity’  with  an  alternative 
reading of how  states  are  situated  in  space  and  time.  This  weakness  is  meta-theoretical 
and  rooted  in  how  moderate  constructivists  approach  the  task  of  ‘showing  a  way 
beyond’  realism:  Because the causal  narrative in which the concept is integrated focuses

on how states (may) escape the condition manifested by realists, those ‘Kantian cultures’ 
and  ‘thick  communities’  are  only  endpoints  of  a  progressive  dynamic  whose  main 
achievement  is  to  overcome  Hobbesian  anarchy  without  replacing  the  ontology  it  is 
linked to. In short, moderate constructivism is not grounded in an original account of the

Conclusion
This  chapter 
institutionalism, 
constructivism -  by tracing their causal narratives to their respective hard core, that is, to 
an  ontology  of the  state  and  its  ‘security  interest’  deducted  from  an  account  of  the 
human  condition,  understood  as  a  reading  of the  spatio-temporal  situatedness  of  ‘the 
state’.  The  main  purpose  was  to  carve  out  the  main  elements  of  the  three  causal 
narratives  and  trace their weakness  in  explaining the  ‘novel  fact’  of German-American 
security  cooperation,  hoping  to  find  some  analytical  openings  which  can  be  carried 
forward for the task of creative theorizing.

The  discussion  showed  that  from  a  deep  theory  perspective  only  realism  presents  an 
original  research  programme  and,  as  such,  an  original  causal  narrative  of  interstate 
security  cooperation.  Its  definition  of  the  national  security  interest  as  a  desire  for 
survival (or self-preservation) understood as maintaining territorial  integrity is anchored 
in  a  (Hobbesian)  account  of the  human  condition  of states  as  autonomous  individuals 
distrusting  each  other  because  they  read  an  uncertain  future  through  a  certain  past, 
namely  a  past  of  conflict/violence.  While  institutionalism  and  constructivism  were 
shown  to  offer  useful  adjustments  to  this  spatio-temporal  situatedness  of the  state  by 
stressing  institutions  and  shared  identities,  the  causal  narrative  these  concepts  are 
integrated  in  are  caught in the attempt to  ‘tame’  and  ‘overcome’  anarchy (e.g.,  realism) 
and,  thus,  are  not anchored  in  an  original  account of the  human condition.  They  do  not 
offer  an  alternative  conception  of  the  state  and  its  national  security  interest  and, 
consequently,  lack  a  substantial  argument  for  what  is  means  for  states  to  have  such 
interests in common (or not).

That said, for the purpose of creative theorizing the analysis encourages taking seriously 
the three basic elements characterising these three causal narratives:  uncertainty as a key 
feature of the human condition (realism), institutions as a modifying structure which can 
alter the  ‘informational  environment’  (institutionalism), and  Self-Other interdependence 
as  an  integrative  force  leading  to  the  spatial  extension  of  ‘the  state’.  In  addition,  the 
analysis  identifies  the  following  conceptual  openings:  (1)  an  evolutionary  ontology  of

90

the  state  with  an  ability  to  learn,  (2)  the  relevance  of nationalism  or  a  ‘binding  idea’ 
more generally, (3) the  notion  of the  state  having a consciousness  and  an  ‘identity’,  (4) 
the social situatedness of the state marked by interdependence/transnational linkages, (5) 
the role  of certain  ‘knowledge’  to deal with  uncertainty and the possibility to share this 
knowledge  with  others.  These  leads  and  openings  are  taken  up  over  the  following 
chapters  and woven  into a new causal  narrative to build a deep theory which  presents a 
substantial  alternative  to  realism  and  is  suitable  to  explain  the  case  at  hand.  The  next 
chapter begins by using opening (3) to explore how a causal narrative stressing ‘identity’ 
can  be  anchored  philosophically  in  an  account  of the  human  condition  by  drawing  on 
Heidegger’s fundamental ontology.

The  previous  chapter  unravelled  three  IR  research  programmes  offering  a  causal 
narrative  on 
institutionalism,  and 
constructivism to reveal their logical  weaknesses  in  explaining dynamics as  in  the  case 
at  hand  and  search  for  conceptual  openings.  One  of the  key  findings  was  that  only 
realism offers an original reading of the human condition adopted from Hobbes’  state of 
nature 
institutionalism  and 
constructivism.  In  an  attempt  to  build  a  ‘better’  -   more  suitable  -   deep  theory,  this 
chapter  leaves the plane of IR to provide the  philosophical  ground  from  which the  state 
and  its  motive  for  investing  in  international  security  institutions  can  be  rethought  (in 
subsequent chapters).  Its objective is to offer a reading of the human condition different 
from  the  Hobbesian  one  and  to  thereby  arrive  at  a  new  ontology  of the  state  and  its 
security interest, i.e. an understanding of what it means to be secure.

replaced  by 

For this purpose, the chapter engages Heidegger’s fundamental ontology to open up new 
ways  of  conceptualizing  the  Self  (‘identity’)  in  the  face  of  uncertainty.  It  explores 
Heidegger’s argument that ‘being’  or,  more precisely, coming into being-in-the-world is 
conditioned  by  awareness  of  finitude  yet  impossibility  to  know  death  and  that  this 
generates  ‘anxiety’  as  the  foundational  sentiment.  The  chapter  suggests  that  shifting 
attention  to  the  Selfs  attempt of coming to  terms  with  anxiety  requires  understanding 
how the  Self seeks orientation through meaningful knowledge of itself and  ‘the world’. 
It  is  shown  how  the  reflexive  ability  of the  Self generates  what  is  termed  an  ‘anxiety 
paradox’,  namely  the  attempt  to  regain  a  sense  of  continuity/stability  which  denies 
contingency  of being  and  carries  the  Self beyond  ‘death’.  Two  strategies  for  gaining 
such  ‘ontological  security’  are  discussed,  namely  mathematical  measuring  and  routine 
practices  (Giddens),  both  of which  are  criticized  by  drawing  on  Heidegger’s  notion  of 
Verfallen  for  failing  to  provide  the  Self with  ‘authenticity’.  This  dilemma  -   gaining 
ontological  security  at  the  cost  of authenticity  -   is  termed  the  ‘anxiety  dilemma’.  The 
chapter ends by arguing that the paradox does not need to end  in  a dilemma if past and 
future  are  conceptualized  as  meaningful  ‘places’  for  the  Self providing  substance  to  a 
narrative o f ‘authentic becoming’.

92

From  ‘Identity’ to ‘Self
The starting point here is given by the postmodern Zeitgeist,  specifically its intervention 
that our understanding of ourselves and the world cannot be taken for granted. That said, 
rather  than  following  the  radical  constructivist  call  and  embrace  contingency,  the  aim 
here  is  to  revisit  the  question  how  humans  react  to  contingency.  In  other  words,  this 
chapter does not aim  at conceptualizing a  ‘postmodern  S elf  but to take the postmodern 
intervention  as  an 
the 
desires/behaviour it gives rise to. As such, this chapter takes up Jef Huysmans’  point that 
“the  postmodern  project  is  a  return  to  Hobbes;  not  to  his  answers...but  to  his 
question... [of]  how to deal with the collapse of certainties”. Equally important,  it is “not 
a celebration  of the  undetermined... [but]  a (plea for the)  search  for new  life  strategies” 
(Huysmans  1998a: 247f.).

the  human  condition  and 

invitation 

to 

think  about 

I  approach  this  task  through  the  constructivist  opening  that  ‘identity’  matters  and  that 
endogenizing  state  identity  is  the  “next  step  in  Constructivist  IR  Theory”  (Cedermann 
and  Daase 2003).  Given the ambiguity of the term  and the apparent failure of moderate 
constructivists to build a new theory on  it, as discussed  in the previous chapter, this step 
requires  some  adjustment.  Indeed,  in  what  may  at  first  seem  counterintuitive  I  follow 
Brubaker  and  Cooper’s  (2000:  2)  suggestion  to  move  ‘beyond  identity’.  To  be  sure, 
eliminating a term from the analytical toolkit does not change the fact that it touches on 
something fundamental.  In  other words,  while  ‘identity’  has  been  overused  analytically 
in  IR,  it  cannot  be  ignored  that  scholars  have  provided  convincing  accounts  of  how 
concerns  about  ‘identity’  affect  foreign  and  security  policy.149  Indeed,  as  Hans  Joas 
(2000:  15If) points out, ever since ‘identity’ was introduced as a sociological concept in 
the early 20th century the view has prevailed that it is  good to have an  ‘identity’.  If one 
takes the  position that states cannot or don’t want to  ‘live’  without an  identity,150 rather 
than asserting that identities constitute  interests, as moderate constructivists do,  it seems 
more fruitful  to explore this very desire of establishing an  ‘identity’. Thus,  from  a deep 
theory  perspective  the  task  is  to  discern  the  condition  which  gives  rise  to  the  “will-to- 
manifest-identity” (Hall  1999).

For understanding this process,  I accept the point made by  Brubaker and  Cooper that  it 
is useful to discard the concept of ‘identity’  and  focus  on the much  older term which  it

150  According  to  Ted  Hopf a  world  without  identities  would  be  a  “world  of chaos,  a  world  of

entails,  namely the  ‘Self.  At  least  since  Freud  identity  is  understood  as  having a  Self- 
consciousness,  as  having  a  ‘sense  of Self.  And  while  the  concept of the  Self emerged 
towards  the  end  of the  19th  century  (Joas,  2000:  149)  the  notion  can  be  traced  back  to 
Plato  (Strong  1991).  Conceptualizing the  state  as  a  Self is  not  as  far-fetched  as  it  may 
seem.  It follows the  logic,  noted  in  chapter one,  that to  define a  states’  security  interest 
and,  hence, to know what the state seeks protection from (the existential threat) requires 
an  understanding  of what  it  means  for the  state  to  be  (to  exist).  Whereas  realists  took 
their clues from Hobbes, my reading relies on an account of the human condition offered 
by Martin Heidegger.

Reading the Human Condition with Heidegger151
Largely  ignored  by  IR  scholars,152  Heidegger  can  be  considered  one  of  the  most 
influential philosophers of the 20th century.153 His standing as a thinker and relevance for 
the purpose at hand  stems primarily from  his attempt of devising an ontology of ‘being’ 
in  his  1927  magnum  opus Sein  und Zeit (‘Being and  Time’).154  In this work,  Heidegger 
explored  the  basic  ontological  question  “what  we  actually  mean  with  the  expression 
‘being’” 
‘existential 
phenomenology’.  Phenomenology  is  a  philosophical  strand  founded  by  his  mentor 
Edmund  Husserl  which,  broadly  speaking,  is  concerned  with  the  study  of phenomena 
through  structures  of  experience.155  Criticizing  any  kind  of  scientific  ‘naturalism’, 
phenomenologists  start  from  the  premise  that  one  cannot  come  to  understand  ‘things’ 
other than through experience.  In Husserl’s words, “the world is an experience which we 
live  before  is  becomes  an  object  which  we  know”  (cited  in  Odysseos  2002a:  376).

(Heidegger  1953:  1 1)  and  developed  what 

is  known  as 

151 Again,  I am neither trying to turn Heidegger into an IR theorist nor to reconstruct his argument 
in  detail  (an  impossible  task  anyhow).  Instead,  the  aim  is  to  discern  some  of his  the  broader 
insights and use them  for creative theorizing, which  is also how Heidegger encouraged others to 
engage his wo’rk.
152  Exceptions  are  Coker  (1998);  Odysseos  (2002a,  2002b;  2007).  This  lack  of  interest  in 
Heidegger among IR scholars stems likely from a combined dislike of his biography (a supporter 
of National Socialism in the  1930s), of what he said (not much about international politics) and of 
the  way  he  wrote (complex arguments  expressed  in  often  opaque  language),  which  has  left him 
rarely  engaged  in  fields  outside  philosophy (see  also  Elden  2004).  The  neglect of Heidegger is 
echoed  by  the  observation  that,  despite  the  ‘interpretative  turn’,  theorists  have  been  slow  to 
engage the study of meaning (A. Williams 2003).
153  For  different  perspectives  on  Heidegger’s  thought,  see  Guignon  (1993,  2006);  Dreyfus  and 
Hall  (1992);  Holland  and  Huntington  (2001);  Kisiel  and  Sheehan  (2006);  and  more  generally 
Safranski (1998).

Importantly, such  ‘knowledge’  gained through experience  is not knowledge in the sense 
of accumulated  information  but  as  having  generated  structures  of meaning which  lend 
significance to the world (meaning understood as Bedeutung).  In  short,  phenomenology 
involves  the  study  of  how  ‘things’,  including  Selfhood,  obtain  meaning  through 
experience.156

Convinced that one cannot devise an abstract theory of consciousness, as Husserl tried to 
do,  Heidegger’s  existential  phenomenology  puts  forward  a  method  for  ‘fundamental 
ontology’  allowing  for  an  “examination  into  what  life  might  reveal  itself  to  be” 
(Odysseos  2002:  381).157  It  is  important  not  to  confuse  this  ‘existentialist’  perspective 
with  a  commitment to  ‘essentialism’  in  the  sense  of locating the  intrinsic  substance  of 
something  (in  this  case  the  Self).  Although  existentialists,  apart  from  Heidegger  most 
famously  Sartre,  share  the  ambition  of  searching  for  the  ‘authentic’  Self,  existential 
phenomenology  does  not  assume  objectification  or  categorization  to  be  possible  or 
feasible.158  As  Dorothea Frede  reminds,  Heidegger’s  engagement with  the  ‘meaning  of 
being’  and  his  embrace  of  phenomenology  arose  out  of  a  dissatisfaction  with 
Aristotelian  ontology,  specifically  the  latter’s  suggestion  that  things  have  a  substance 
independent from our perception of them, that there is “a primary category of substance, 
designating natural  ‘things’ that exist in their own right” (Frede 2006:  44, Aristotle NE). 
To  Heidegger,  such  a  view  is  mistaken  in  assuming  that  things  were  read  off ‘nature’ 
rather  than  into  it  and  misleading  in  that  it  did  not  address,  indeed  obscured,  the 
underlying question  of the meaning o f being in  a unified,  holistic  sense, thereby ending 
up  using  an  empty  concept.  In  Heidegger’s  view,  the  meaning  of being  can  only  be 
grasped  through  an  account  of  our  specific  understanding  of  being,  which  requires 
grasping our experience of and with  ‘the world’  and the meaning structure this gives rise 
to (Frede 2006; also Odysseos 2007:  3Iff). As discussed further below,  in offering such 
an  account  Heidegger  also  rejects  the  Cartesian  duality  of mind  and  matter  (body)  by 
arguing  that  ‘being’  is  both  more  than  a  state  of mind  and  not  reducible  to  a  physical 
body.

156  Heidegger’s  exploration  of meaning  comes  at  a time  in  Germany  after the  First  World  War 
where  there  was  an  atmosphere  of disenchantment,  of having  lost  the  belief in  enlightenment’s 
promise  for  progress.  This  feeling  of a  spiritual  void  is  visible  in  the  writings  of a  number  of 
thinkers at the time such as Weber, Freud, or Mannheim. See Williams, A. (2003:  16f).
157 Here Heidegger departed  from  Husserl’s view of phenomenology as  a scientific method, that 
is,  with  the  possibility  of finding  the  essence  of consciousness  (or  perception),  what  Husserl 
called  ‘transcendental subjectivity’, see Safranski (1998); Odysseos (2002); Dostal (1993).

As  Louiza  Odysseos  points  out,  Heidegger’s  fundamental  ontology  can  be  seen  as  a 
philosophical precursor for the postmodern agenda of deconstructing assumptions about 
subjectivity -  his writings significantly influenced the icons of postmodern thought such 
as Foucault, Levinas and Derrida -  yet it also opens up ways for reconstructing the same 
through  understanding  how  Selfhood  is  constituted  (Odysseos  2007).  For  some,  this 
makes  Heidegger’s  fundamental  ontology 
‘Copemican 
revolution’  in  philosophy brought  about  by  Kant (Blattner 2006).  While  Heidegger did 
not  present  (did  not  aim  at  presenting)  a  theory  of the  Self  ‘as  such’,  his  analysis  of 
“existential  understanding”  (Heidegger  1953:  12)  certainly  makes  him  a  foundational 
figure 
interpretative  approach  similar  to  Weber’s  notion  of 
Verstehen and further developed by Hans-Georg Gadamer (2004  [1975]; Hoy  1993).  For 
the  present  purpose,  his  hermeneutical  exploration  in  Sein  und  Zeit  engages  the 
fundamental  spatio-temporal  parameters  within  which  (the  consciousness  of)  human 
existence unfolds.

Being-in-the-Worldas  ‘Unfolding*
Heidegger develops his  understanding of being or,  in his terminology, Dasein'59  as one 
of ‘being-in-the-world’.  The  hyphens  are  used  deliberately  by  Heidegger to  symbolise 
that  an  account  of ‘being’  cannot  be  ontologically  separated  from  an  understanding  of 
‘the  world’  (Heidegger  1953:  §12).  One  does  not  exist  previously  of  or  independent 
from the other; their meanings are interwoven.  For Heidegger the  inherent  ‘worldliness’ 
of human  existence  -   a  term  which  he  uses  to  describe  “the  structure  of a  constitutive 
moment  of  ‘being-in-the-world’”  (Heidegger  1953:  64)  -   must  be  thought  of  as  the 
aspect  of  the  human  condition  (Mulhall  2005:  61).  Time  and  space  are  the  two 
dimensions in and through which the Self develops its ‘worldliness’.

As  the  title  of his  study  conveys,  Heidegger’s  attempt to  conceptualise  the  ‘structural 
whole’  of being-in-the-world focuses primarily on the temporal dimension. He opens the 
study with declaring as his aim “the interpretation of time as the possible horizon of any 
understanding of being” (Heidegger,  1953:  1). As we shall see further below, this makes 
his philosophy particularly suitable to rethink how uncertainty conditions the  Self.  That

159  Heidegger  (1953,  §11)  makes  a  terminological  distinction  between  Sein  and  Dasein,  the 
former  acknowledging  that  there  are  different  ‘beings’  or  ‘things  that  are’  (Seinendes)  and  the 
latter designating human being, which  he sees as distinct because of its ability to reflect about its 
existence (Dasein as an  expression  of understanding Sein).  Dasein  is what his  study  is primarily 
concerned  with  because,  not  disregarding  other  ‘beings’,  for  Heidegger Dasein  is  logically  the 
only kind humans can reason about (and the question he and most philosophy is grappling with is 
how).  For a extensive discussion  on the difficulty of translating Dasein into English,  see  Malpas 
(2006: 47-50).

said, more recently theorists have rediscovered Heidegger also as a philosopher of being 
in  space.  As  Peter  Sloterdijk  points  out,  Sein  und  Zeit  “contains  the  seed  of  a 
revolutionary  treatise  on  being  and  space”  (Sloterdijk  1998:  336,  my  translation)  and 
Jeff Malpas  even  suggests  that  Heidegger’s  overall  work  provides  “perhaps  the  most 
important  and  sustained  inquiry  into  place  found  in  the  history  of  Western  thought” 
(Malpas 2006: 3; also Elden, 2001).

spatial  dimension  becomes  central 

The 
to  his  ontology  when  Heidegger’s 
conceptualization of ‘being-towards-death’, discussed below,  becomes an exploration of 
how being  is constituted  via  its  ‘orientation’  and  ‘situatedness’  in the world  (Heidegger 
1953,  §23  and  §24).  In  conceptualizing this  ‘situatedness’  of the  Self,  contained  in  the 
term Da-Sein which  literally means ‘being-there’, Heidegger rejects the Cartesian notion 
of geometric space, a res extensa that can be measured objectively (see also below).  For 
Heidegger  a  sense  of being-there  is  generated  by  disclosing  ‘the  world’,  by  gaining  a 
sense  of  ‘being  in’.  His  conceptualisation  of  being-in-the-world  fits  neither  with 
environmental  determinism  nor  with  the  notion  of  a  Self  dreaming  up  a  world. 
Heidegger  notes  that  ‘being-in-the-world’  can  not  be  understood  analogue  to  our 
understanding of the  ‘water  in the  glass’  or the  ‘dress  in  the  closet’.  If this  was  so  ‘the 
world’  would  logically be  independent from and thus prior to  ‘being’, a possibility ruled 
out by the ontologically foundational nature o f ‘being’  (Heidegger  1953:  54).  So being is 
not established by ‘discovering’ or ‘recognizing’  its place in a pre-existing world.

Yet neither is it the case that Selves are creators of their worlds, as this would  imply that 
the  Self comes  into  ‘being’  independently  of and  prior  to  this  process  of creation.  For 
Heidegger,  a  phenomenological  perspective  holds  that  ‘being’  is  not  thinkable  prior to 
‘the  world’,  that  is,  we  cannot  assume  the  Self to  be  some  independent  spirit  which 
subsequently is placed, or finds its place,  in space.  ‘Being-in-the-world’  implies that this 
being  has  already  discovered  ‘the  world’  or,  more  precisely,  a  world  without  which  it 
could not exist (Heidegger  1953:  110).  In contemporaiy terminology, one might say the 
‘Self and ‘the world’ are mutually constituted. In Heidegger’s words,

“space  is  ‘in’  the  world  to  the  extent  that  ‘being-in-the-world’...has 
disclosed space. The space is not situated in the subject, neither does it [the 
subject]  regard  the  world  ‘as  i f   it  was  in  a  space,  but  the  ontologically 
properly understood  ‘subject’, the Dasein,  is  in  an original  sense  [in einem 
urspruenglichen Sinn]  spatial” (Heidegger 1953:  111).

97

Leaving the conceptualization of the spatial parameters of being-in-the-world to the next 
chapter, the point to be made here is that spatial situatedness is not fixed but inscribed  in 
time and, as a consequence, evolving.

The  evolving character of being-in-the-world  is  given by the  overriding  significance  of 
the temporal  dimension  in  Heidegger’s ontology, which  starts  with  the  recognition  that 
being  ‘takes  place’  in  a  time-span  between  birth  and  death.  As  Heidegger  puts  it,  the 
basic  feature  of the  human  condition  is  that  the  Self is  ‘thrown’  into  ‘the  world’  and 
towards death. And because until  it is dead there is always something the Self is not-yet, 
‘being’  is  always  incomplete,  making  “permanent  incompleteness”  a  central  feature  in 
the configuration of being (Heidegger  1953:  233, 236, 242f.). This  incompleteness gives 
‘being’  a dynamic or evolutionary character in which neither the Self nor ‘its’  world can 
ever be solidified.  Being-in-the-world  is constituted in a continuous process in which the 
Self  discloses  [erschliessen]  ‘the  world’  and  by  doing  so  discloses  and  comes  to 
understand 
ist  seine 
Erschlossenheit” (Heidegger  1953 :  133). The process of disclosure (or understanding) of 
the  Self  and  the  world  can  be  conceptualised  as  a  mutually  constitutive  process  of 
‘coming  into  being’  together.  Said  differently,  the  Self and  its  world  are  understood  to 
be  in  a permanent process of becoming or  unfolding, what Heidegger at one  point calls 
Aufgehen (Heidegger 1953:  54,  110).,6°

it,  “das  Dasein

Heidegger  is  clear  that  ‘unfolding’  is  not  reducible  to  a  mental  process.  It  is  not  mere 
spiritual 
through 
involvement/engagement and,  thus,  activity (or practice, to use the term  popular among 
pragmatists).  He  notes  repeatedly  that  things  only  obtain  meaning  through  their  usage 
and  are  organised  or  ‘placed’  accordingly.  As  Henri  Bergson,  a  French  philosopher 
whose  ideas  found  their  way  into  Heidegger’s  Sein  und  Zeit  (although  not  always 
favourably)  notes,  conscious  beings  “do  not  find  themselves  in  a  world  but  make 
themselves...and  make  the  world...through  their  activity,  their  engagement”  (Grosz, 
2005:  121).161  At  the  same  time,  for  Heidegger  engagement  with  the  world  is  not  ‘a- 
theoretical’,  that  is,  it  is  not  the  act  as  such  that  captures  the  ontological  structure  of 
being  but  the  perspective  from  which  it  is  done.  Consequently,  acts  need  to  be 
understood  in  context  of this  perspective.  Even  more  so,  as  ‘the  world’  is  made  in

mutual constitution with the Self, the process of disclosing is not simply about gathering 
information  from  a  pre-existing world  located  outside the  Self.  Unfolding encompasses 
all  kinds  of  seeing  ‘the  world’,  including  forgetting  (Heidegger  1953:  62)  and  is  a 
creative process.

This creative process of coming into  being-in-the-world  (‘unfolding’) will  be  discussed 
in  detail  in  the  next  chapter.  For  now,  it  suffices  to  say  that  the  unfolding  perspective 
offers  an  alternative  to  ‘Hobbesian’  ontology  adopted  by  realists  most  obviously  by 
rendering the assumption of the  Self striving for self-preservation unsuitable.  Instead of 
assuming  an  intrinsic  property  already  ‘there’  to  be  preserved,  ‘coming  into  being’  is 
more appropriately grasped as the Self pursuing an agenda of se\f-determination without 
necessarily assuming this to mean striving for autonomy. To understand what drives this 
process  from  a  deep-theory  perspective  and  how  it  differs  from  the  Hobbesian  view,  it 
necessary to take a closer look at Heidegger’s account of the human condition.

Anxiety as the Foundational Sentiment
Heidegger’s fundamental engagement with the temporal dimension o f ‘being’  leads him 
to  identify,  like  Hobbes,  uncertainty  as  a  central  factor  in  structuring  the  human 
condition.  Yet Heidegger’s discussion  about the  impact of uncertainty on  being and,  by 
extension on its relations with others, takes a different route than Hobbes.

Heidegger starts with the seemingly trivial fact that the one thing affecting the  Self in  a 
unique  way  is  its  own  death.  Death  is  unique  quite  simply  because  it  signifies  the 
moment after which  ‘being’  becomes  impossible (Heidegger  1953:  250).  Said  the other 
way  around,  death  is  the  utmost  and  unsurpassable  possibility  of being.  Because  it  is 
only  then  that  the  life-span  is  ‘complete’,  and  because  the  fmitude  of ones’  existence 
cannot be shared, that is, because death happens only to the dying individual,  Heidegger 
argues  that  it  is  here,  in  experiencing  death,  where  ‘being’  is  constituted  in  its 
wholeness.  However,  as  noted  earlier,  being  is  always  incomplete  because  until  it 
happens,  the  Self is  merely  (inevitably)  moving  towards  death.  Heidegger  solves  the 
conceptual  dilemma  by  arguing  that  it  is  not  death  as  such  but fear  of  death  which 
constitutes  true  being  (Ibid,  184ff).162  This  appears  to  be  on  par  with  Hobbes’ 
assumption  that  the  fear  of a  future  in  which  only  death  is  certain  is  a  shared  by  all 
individuals.  Yet  as  Odysseos  (2002b)  points  out,  in  contrast  to  Hobbes,  Heideggerian 
logic  does  not  conclude  that  this  fear  results  in  the  fear  of others,  that  is,  it  does  not

162  On  this  point  (and  others)  Heidegger  was  influenced  by  Kierkegaard,  one  of the  very  few 
names Heidegger respectfully mentions in Sein und Zeit.

99

translate  in  suspicion  about  other’s  intentions  and  in  considering  its  capabilities  a 
potential threat. The reason is, again, that it is logically impossible to have an experience 
of what  it  means  to  die.  As  Heidegger  discusses  at  length,  even  the  death  of a  close 
family  member  is  an  experience  that,  ultimately,  cannot  be  shared  (Heidegger  1953,  § 
47).

The  implications  of this  seemingly  trivial  point  are  profound:  without  being  able  to 
experience death  it is impossible to know what to fear.  While knowledge of inescapable 
finitude  fundamentally  affects  ‘being’  and  makes  ‘death’  an  integral  part  of our world, 
indeed  “a  phenomenon  of  life”,  we  are  unable  to  comprehend  ‘it’  in  the  sense  of 
grasping  it as  a meaningful thing (Heidegger  1953:  246).  And  so  we  also  cannot  really 
fear that which brings death about, that is, we cannot ‘know’ the existential threat.163 The 
inability to  locate the existential  threat makes  it  seem  to  be  potentially everywhere  and 
appear out of nowhere (Ibid,  186).  This  leads  Heidegger to the fundamental  insight that 
it  is  not  fear through  which  we  have  to  comprehend the  ontological  structure  of being 
but  anxiety  [Sorge]  (Heidegger  1953:  191 ff).164  It  is  this  anxiety,  coming  out  of the 
unknowability  of 
sentiment  or  mood 
[Befindlichkeit]  of the  human  condition.  In  Heidegger’s  words,  the  sentiment/mood  of 
anxiety  is prior to any wills, desires, needs, or drives and  provides the ontology of being 
with  an  “original  structural  whole”  [ursprungliche  Strukturganze]  Although  he  is 
reluctant  to  reduce  fear  or  anxiety  to  a  strictly  emotional  experience,  he  thus  places  a 
feeling  at  the  centre  of the  human  condition  (from  which  wills  or  desires  can  spring) 
(Heidegger  1953:  §41,  192f.).

An  ontology which takes anxiety as the basic sentiment/mood provides an alternative to 
the  Hobbesian  ‘condition’  -   indeed,  one  could  argue  surpasses  Hobbes -  by taking the 
same  starting  point,  fear  of  death,  but  embarking  on  a  logically  more  compelling 
direction  by  problematizing  the  nature  of this  fear.  The  combination  of knowing  that 
death  may  occur  at  any  moment  and  the  inability  of  comprehending  it  brings  the 
Heideggerian  account  close  to  the  postmodern  emphasis  on  the  radical  contingency  of 
the  human  condition.  However,  other

and can be used for both ‘care’ and ‘anxiety’. Heidegger uses it in the latter sense.

influences  behaviour requires exploring how the Self reacts to (deals with) anxiety, how 
it structures its sense of being-in-the-world.

As  the  following  discussion  shows,  there  is  ample  evidence  that  the  Self  does  not 
embrace  anxiety  but  seeks  ways  to  tame  the  same  by  reducing  or  ‘controlling’ 
contingency.  In simple terms, it is suggested that the Self seeks stability through gaining 
a sense of continuity of being-in-the-world.  To use the terminology offered  by Anthony 
Giddens,  the  question  then  becomes  what  “anxiety  controlling  mechanisms”  are 
employed  by  the  unfolding  Self to  obtain  this  sense  of stability,  or what  Giddens  calls 
‘ontological  security’  (Giddens  1984:  50;  also  Giddens  1991).  The  below  discussion 
reviews two prominent strategies of how humans attempt to  ‘tame’  anxiety and  create a 
sense  of continuity -  through  mathematical  symbols and  routine  practices -  and  draws 
on Heidegger to suggest that these  ‘mechanisms’ fall short because they do not allow for 
authentic being.

The Anxiety Paradox:  Contingency and Continuity
Awareness  of contingency  is  not  a  ‘postmodern’  phenomenon  but  emerges  at  the  very 
moment  of  enlightenment.  Indeed,  it  is  the  very  motivation  for  assuming  universal 
reason.  This  insight  has  been  noted  by  numerous  analysts  of (post)modemity,  such  as 
Zygmunt  Baumann  or  David  Harvey,  and  is  expressed  perhaps  most  famously  in 
Horkheimer  and  Adorno’s  Dialectic  o f  Enlightenment,  which  points  out  that  the 
‘knowledge’  generated  by  the  enlightenment  was  not  so  different  from  the  myth  it 
sought to replace (Horkheimer and Adorno  1988).

The  example  used  by  Horkheimer and  Adorno  is  the  transition  in  ancient  Greece  to  a 
‘post-mythical’  condition,  that  is,  a  condition  when  the  conviction  that time  and  space 
were  cosmic  creations  ordered  by  the  Gods  was  replaced  by  more  ‘self conscious’  or 
reflexive thinking. Originally, ‘mythical’ or ‘cosmic’ time followed a natural rhythm and 
was not seen as passing, humans did not see themselves as masters of their own fate and 
hence  did  not  (need  to)  reflect  over  their  own  finitude  or  contemplate  about  the  past. 
Their world was one without uncertainty and anxiety (Horkheimer and Adorno  1988:  33, 
50ff;  also Gunnell,  1987:  25ff). For Horkheimer and Adorno the emergence of temporal 
self-consciousness, the transition from the myth to an understanding of human existence 
as  a  historical  one  and  corresponding  speculation  about the  human  place  in  the  world, 
had  an  “enlightenment  character”.  In  John  Gunnell’s  (1987)  reading,  the  transition 
occurred in two steps.

101

The  first  was  the  separation  of  the  past  from  the  present,  and  the  mortal  from  the 
immortal, as articulated  in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.  In these epic poems, connections 
between  the  gods  and  humans  still  exist,  but  the  gods  become  gradually  disassociated 
from  nature  and  are  not  portrayed  as  the  creators  of the  cosmos.  Individual  action  is 
given  a  sense  of  uniqueness  with  humans  being  influenced  by  their  experience,  by 
emotions, aware of their mortality and  partially claiming responsibility for their actions. 
The emergence of the human as a self-conscious individual  is visible  in particular in the 
journey  of  Ulysses  where  “historical  time  is  strenuously...detached  from  space” 
(Horkheimer and Adorno  1988:  55; Gunnell  1987:  79f). Yet the poetic challenge did not 
go all the way. The unity of Ulysses’  adventures remains external to the  individual,  it is 
a  sequence  of events  in  places  dominated  by  local  gods  in  which  “the  inner  form  of 
organizing  individuality,  time,  remains  weak”  (Horkheimer  and  Adorno  1988:  55). 
While  introducing awareness  of human  finitude,  the  possibility  of achieving a  status of 
immortality of the soul was maintained and  linked to the performance of god-like heroic 
deeds  (Gunnell  1987:  87).  Furthermore,  Homeric  epics,  as  well  as  the  histories  of 
Thucydides  and  Heredot,  described  a present whose  order remained oriented  towards  a 
past characterized by crisis,  suffering,  and tragedy, that is,  towards a disorderly  ‘origin’ 
from  which  there  is  no  escape,  captured  in  Thucydides’  famous  statement  that  his 
account of the Peloponnesian War was to be ‘a possession for all time’  (Ibid,  lOflf).

The mythic language of Homeric poetry and the notion of eternal tragedy claimed by the 
historians  was  challenged  by  Plato.  Convinced  that  knowledge  was  not  cosmic  but 
generated  by  humans,  Plato  criticized  the  Athenian  society  as  ordered  by  values 
“embedded  in  a  mesmeric  folk  memory”  (Gunnell  1987:  127).  By  emphasizing  the 
human ability for shaping the future, his view was that the creative mind should extricate 
itself from  the  Hellenic  myth,  that  is,  break with the  gods  and  engage  in  re-envisioning 
order.  Plato  expressed this  most famously  in  the Republic,  where  five types  of city  are 
discussed  as  housing  five  arrangements  of the  soul.165  Having  Socrates  propose  “let  us 
create  a  city  from  the  beginning,  in  our  theory”,  Plato  broke  with  the  repetitive 
conception  of (dis)order tied to the  memory of tragedy and  suggested that the  poet and 
the  philosopher (himself) were  “expressing different modes  of existence”  placing them 
in  “a competition  for the soul  of Athens” (cited  in Gunnell  1987:  152,  128f).  Yet while 
emphasizing  human  creativity  and,  with  it,  agency  and  an  open  future,  Plato  kept  the 
idea  of immortality  of the  soul.  Instead  of linking  the  soul’s  immortality  to  rituals  or 
god-like heroic deeds,  eternity now could  be reached through the (philosophers’) ability

165 See the Plato chapter in Strong (1991).

to  envision/create a just/good order in which the soul could be embedded. The  Self was 
to  remain eternally linked to the polis, which was to serve as  its permanent ‘home’,  “an 
imperishable space” which would transcend human time (Gunnell  1987:  115).

the  fundamental  paradox  characterizing 

The Anxiety Paradox
This  account  reveals 
the 
‘enlightened’  individual,  which  I  call  the  ‘anxiety-paradox’:  awareness  of its  ability  to 
organize  the  temporal  world  is  accompanied  by  reluctance  of  fully  accepting  the 
consequences  and  an  attempt  to  re-introduce  an  eternal  perspective.  More  precisely, 
awareness  of being  positioned  in  finite  time  and  recognizing  that  past  and  future  are 
dimensions  affected  by,  and  affecting,  human  activity,  ‘post-mythical’  conceptions  of 
time  did  not  embrace  contingency  but  convey  a  desire  to  hold  on  to  some  sort  of 
‘continuity’.  Tellingly,  Henri  Bergson,  whose  work  on  the temporal  constitution  of the 
evolutionary  Self has recently been  reclaimed as an avantgarde of postmodern thinking, 
notes  at  one  point  that  the  “natural  inclination”  of the  mind  is  to  proceed  “by  solid 
perceptions...and  stable  conceptions”  (cited  in  Grosz  2005:  135).  This  inclination  to 
‘solidify’  and/or ‘stabilise’ the world and the Self within  it, and the strategies pursued to 
satisfy this  desire  reveals  that  humans,  upon  recognizing  that  they  are  masters  of their 
own  future,  attempt to  extend themselves beyond  ‘their’  time by becoming re-inscribed 
into a permanent space outside human intervention.

Examples  how  the  freedom  to  intervene  and  imagine  is  used  to  re-order time  in  a way 
that  allows  for an  eternal  perspective  surpassing death  can  be  found  everywhere.  Since 
antiquity  humans  have  placed  a  lot  of effort  in  creating  what  Aleida  Assmann  calls 
‘spaces  of  remembrance’  which  allow  being  carried  over 
into  the  ‘afterworld’ 
(Nachwelt),  whether  through  poetry,  scriptures,  architecture,  or  images  (Assmann 
1999).166  Attempts  to  insert  a  structural  element  into  the  conceptualization  of time  are 
strongly  visible  in  the  teleology  of  Judeo-Christian  narratives,  not  only  in  religious 
doctrines where  eternity  is  sought most clearly through  inscribing the  Self into  a moral 
universe,  but  also  in  the  secular  philosophies  of Kant,  Hegel,  and  Marx.167  Although 
these  narratives  differ  regarding  the  relative  openness  of  the  future,  ‘the  world’  is

166 Consider the example of Alexander the Great shedding tears at the grave of Achilles not out of 
grievance but because he  realized that Achilles  was  given  immortality through  Homer’s  poetry, 
whereas he, Alexander, did not have a Homer (Assmann,  1999: 39-43).
167  On  immortality  ideologies  in  Western  philosophy,  see  Sheets-Johnstone  (2003);  also 
Hutchings (2008).  As Hutchings shows this reaches all the way  into  IR theory.  It is not difficult 
to see that,  for instance, realism’s emphasis of standing in a tradition beginning with Thucydides 
and stressing the same cyclical  view of history also fulfils a stabilising function.

become aware of this path and optimize its standing in it.

Modern Answers: Numbers and Routines
There  are  two  strategies  of  mastering  time  and  space  dominating  modem  societies, 
namely  mathematical  measures  (scientific  time/space)  and  routine  practices.  They  are 
important to  look at because they significantly influence how analysts conceive of states 
and their actions.

fluctuations 

The  first  is  the  quantification  of  time  and  space.  Mathematical  measurement  allows 
humans  to  increasingly  live  “within  a  world  of symbols  of their  own  making”  (Elias, 
1992:  42).  It  allows  imagining  time  and  space  as  part  of  an  eternal  order  of  things 
without contradicting human agency in timing and mapping by assuming that a sequence 
of events  and  the  discovery  of new  ‘lands’  can  be  mentally  ordered  (‘calculated’)  by 
everyone in the same way. Hence, along Kantian lines this ‘Cartesian’  approach assumes 
that the  scientific conception  of time and  space  is universally accessible through  reason 
(Elias  1992:  123).  In this imagination, the temporal dimension is reduced to a succession 
of numbers and  intervals with  a universal  logic,  providing a scale  into which  all  events 
embedded.  Designed 
and 
supported  with

mechanical/computerized  measures, 
time  becomes  cognitively  controllable  and 
universally accessible through mathematical logic, manifest in the Western calendar, the 
24-hour  clock,  and  ‘timetables’  which  map  out past  and  future  and  allow  synchronised 
planning.168  Time 
if  part  of  the  eternal  order  ‘running’ 
(flowing/passing)  external  to  human  thought.  The  same  applies  to  space.  Once  the 
medieval  image  of a  flat  earth  sandwiched  between  heaven  and  hell  was  discredited, 
science  became  the  new  authority  for  ‘accurately  representing’  or  mapping  space, 
carefully  recording  of  ‘the  world’,  including  the  existence  of  states.  Their  spatial 
imagination  became  neutral,  seemingly  detached  from  a  particular  place.  As  John 
Agnew  points  out,  mathematical  measures  enhance  the  sense  that  modem  mapping  is 
devoid  of bias  and  convince  the  reader  of “a  fairly  close  approximation  between  the 
maps  and  what  [lies]  ‘out  there’  in  the  world  beyond  immediate  experience”.  Its  maps 
thus  purport to  convey  an  image  of the  world  “without the  actively  mediating  hand  of

(Guerlac,  2006:  76),  and  Elias  as  a  reaction  to  the  fear  of  death,  that  is,  the  “longing  for 
something  permanent  behind 
impermanence  of  all  observable  data...for  something 
imperishable... as the solid fundament of transient lives” (Elias  1992:  128).

the  cartographer”  (Agnew  2003:  19),  providing  a  sense  of knowing  the  world  as  it  is 
today and will be tomorrow.

The  second  anxiety  controlling  mechanisms  are  eveiyday  practices,  or  routines,  which 
may be seen as complementary to scientific measures or as reducing contingency in their 
own  right.  Routines  play  a  central  role  in  Giddens’  structuration  theory,  a  popular 
reference  for  moderate  constructivists,  some  of whom  have  recently  also  emphasized 
their  function  of  providing  ontological  security  to  states  (Giddens  1984,  1991).169 
Echoing  the  human  condition  as  marked  by  awareness  of  being  positioned 
in 
‘irreversible  time’  (Giddens  1984:  35),  a  term  taken  from  Bergson,  Giddens  draws  on 
Heidegger to argue that the  Self seeks  ‘anxiety controlling mechanisms’. He argues that 
the  Self attempts to establish  a sense of temporal continuity through everyday practices, 
or routines which, for Giddens are carried over from the past and established  in a social 
setting.170 Yet contingency is reduced not simply because practices are being shared but 
by  because  it  being  a  routine,  that  is,  by  carrying  a  familiarity  that  comes  from  being 
‘established’  in  the  past and  carried  over through  formal  or  informal  institutional  rules. 
The  appeal  of routine  practices  is  thus  that they  hold  the  promise to  exist  indefinitely. 
Said  differently,  although  taking  place  in  a  moment,  a  routine  act  is  not  a  contingent 
experience but implies continuity by making the individual part of a structure capable of 
outliving  its  ‘irreversible time’.  By  plucking the  individual  into what Giddens  calls the 
Tongue  duree’  of  institutional  time,  routines  provide  a  structural  frame  which  the 
individual can hold onto to experience the illusion of immortality.

Mathematical  measures  and  routine  practices  seem  well  suited  to  control  anxiety  by 
providing  individuals  with  a  structural  promise  for  continuity.  Because  their  promise 
reaches above and  beyond  individuals, the accounts suggest that these mechanisms also 
satisfy a demand for ‘simultaneity’, highlighting the attraction of a socially shared order 
for  coping  with  anxiety.  That  said,  these  accounts  show  four  interrelated  weaknesses, 
most  visibly  in  the  case  of scientific  time  but  applying  to  routines  as  well.  First,  they 
contain  a thin conceptualisation  of past and  future;  second,  they are rather static  and  do 
not  accommodate  an  evolutionary  understanding  of  being  as  unfolding;  third,  their 
universal  character  of  does  not  account  for  particular  narratives  of  unfolding  and,

169 For an application of Giddens’  structuration theory to IR, see Wendt (1992),  for a critique see 
Jaeger (1996).  For an  adaptations of his notion of ontological security sustained through  routine 
practice to IR, see Huysmans (1998a); Mitzen (2006).
70  In  highlighting  the  importance  of  the  social  dimension  for  stabilising  meaning,  Giddens 
echoes what Benedikt Anderson  (2006) calls the  desire  for ‘simultaneity’.  The  social  dimension 
is addressed in chapter six.

105

finally,  these  accounts  disconnect the  Self from  a  world  of meaningful experiences.  In 
particular  the  last  to  points  show  that  these  ‘mechanisms’  stand  in  conflict  with  the 
search  for authenticity as a response to anxiety. As the temporal dimension  is the one  in 
which  the  anxiety  paradox  emerges,  the  below  will  focus  on  the  shortcomings  with 
reference to that dimension. The next chapter will engage the spatial dimension as well.

Back to Experience
Most  obviously,  establishing  a  universal  conception  of  time  as  successive  and 
unalterable units makes for a thin,  indeed empty conception of past and future. They are 
seamlessly  connected  on  a  numbered  scale,  distinguished  cognitively  merely  by  a 
number  (1958  versus  2058)  and  trapped  in  a  progressive  logic  where  all  ‘future’ 
numbers  eventually  become  ‘past’  ones.  While  in  a  sense  the  Self evolves  (‘ages’)  by 
moving along the numeric time scale, this  kind of ‘becoming’  is primarily conceived  of 
as  a steady and  gradual  movement where experiences are recorded through  marking the 
successive  occurrence  of events.  Yet  numbers  do  not  convey  the  meaning  associated 
with experiences and how they contributed to unique disclosures of being-in-the-world.

Criticizing  the  universal  conception  of,  in  particular,  scientific  time,  scholars  from 
different fields (philosophy,  sociology, anthropology) have shown  how unique temporal 
orders have evolved  in  spatially bounded  social  settings,  giving rise to the  phenomenon 
of ‘social  time’.  For  instance,  Norbert Elias  discusses  in  detail  how  timing  is  a  ‘socio- 
centric activity’  where  context-specific  experiences  are  organised  along  a  “social  time- 
grid”  (Elias  1992:  91,  95).  He  argues that the  sterile  sequencing  of events  in  scientific 
time  brushes  over  the  fact  that  “the  meaning  of  past,  present  and  future  constantly 
changes,  because the  human  beings...whose  experiences  they  represent  also  constantly 
change and the connection with them” (Elias  1992:  76).  The basic insight is that the way 
humans  order/conceive  of  time  differs  because  their  ‘tim e’  is  filled  with  different 
experiences, rendering scientific time empty and homogenous.

Before  Heidegger,  the  “strange  timelessness  of the  Newtonian  world”  as  one  which  is 
stripped of experiences and meaning has also been criticised perhaps most forcefully by 
Bergson  (cited  in  Guerlac,  2006:  28).  Whereas  in  Elias’  account the  role  of meaningful 
experiences 
in  ordering  time  is  gradually  blended  out  over  the  course  of  the 
civilising/modernisation  process,171  they  are  at  the  centre  of Bergson’s  critique  of the

171  Elias ends up arguing that different temporal orders are the result of being situated at different 
stages  in the  ‘civilizing process’, going hand in hand with an  increased need to synchronize and 
coordinate  activities  in  modem  societies  (Elias  1992:  122).  This  reading  is  similar  to  that  of

106

‘emptiness’  of scientific  time.  Against  the  view  of a  Self plugged  into  a  neutralizing 
‘outer  time’,  where  conceiving  of  time  through  a  succession  of  numbers  is  akin  to 
counting units in space, he argues that if we want to understand how conceptions of Self 
evolve  in  the  temporal  dimension  we  need  to  focus  on  how  meaningful  experiences 
constitute  what he  calls  ‘inner time’.  According to  Bergson the  individual’s thinking  in 
time primarily occurs not on a cognitive but on an emotional level, and its  ‘inner time’  is 
grounded  in  the  “quality”  of  lived  experience,  in  the  “intensity”  of  the  sensations 
triggered  internally  in  response  to  ‘external’  events  (Guerlac,  2006:  6 If).  Hence  these 
experiences cannot be conceptualized through  static  symbols but need to be  understood 
through  what  he  calls  ‘duration’  of  a  unique  experience.  When  drawing  on  these 
experiences, the  individual  is “closer to dreaming than to  knowing”, acting on the basis 
of what  is  often  called  intuition  (Guerlac  2006:  43).  In  line  with  his  notion  of creative 
evolution,  for  Bergson  sensations  derived  from  experiences  are  not  merely  ‘conserved’ 
but  evolve  by  mixing  with  other  meaningful  experiences,  the  synthesizing  dynamic  of 
which  makes  ‘inner  time’  a  creative  process  in  which  the  fusion  of experiences  is  a 
source of energy (Grosz, 2005).172

An  important implication of Bergson’s notion  o f ‘inner time’  ordered around  significant 
experiences  which  cannot  be  quantified  is  that they  cannot  be  fully  communicated  and 
are therefore difficult to share.  Experiences differ in  intensity/quality among individuals 
and  so do their conceptions of inner time. And just as a fusion of experiences cannot be 
comprehended through scientific mapping along a numbered time-scale,  Bergson  argues 
that attempts to translate  inner time  into  (communicate  it through)  a common  language 
will  succeed “only at the  level  of the  superficial  self’  inevitably  leading to a  loss of the 
“passionate  self’  (Guerlac,  2006:  77).  Because  language  neutralizes  the  emotions 
associated  with  ‘quality’  experience,  representations  of  inner  times  through  shared 
symbols  has  the  consequence  that  “little  by  little  one  looses  sight  of the  fundamental 
self’  (ibid.,  71).  While  some  elements  of  Bergson’s  approach,  most  significantly  his 
disassociation  of  time  from  space,  173  stand  in  tension  with  a  phenomenological 
perspective  pursued  here,  the  notion  of the  Self organising  its  being-in-time  through 
emotionally  significant experiences  and the creative potential  of the  same are  important 
and will be further explored in the next chapter.

Anderson (2006) and Tilly (1994) who describe the evolution of temporal orders as a function of 
modernisation  and  focus  on  how  the  desire  for  continuity/simultaneity  in  modem  societies  is 
exploited  by,  that  is,  how  the  anxiety  controlling  mechanisms  are  controlled  by,  some  larger 
structural  force, such as capitalism.
172 Heidegger discusses something similar to synthesis in his notion o f ‘ecstasy’.
173 Because for him space only exists in the Newtonian conception, which  he rejects.

107

The Anxiety Dilemma:  Verfallen and Authenticity
Much  of  the  critique  directed  against  scientific  time  can  be  extended  to  everyday 
practices through  Heidegger’s  discussion  of the  phenomenon  of Verfallen.  The  view of 
the  everyday as  manifesting  ‘being-in-the-world’  by  providing a  structure  which  tames 
temporal  anxiety  is  discussed  at  length  by  Heidegger.174  Indeed,  Heidegger  sees  the 
disclosure  of everydayness as the  dominant kind  of unfolding.  Others  play a prominent 
role in this process, yet not so much in the sense of differentiation against which the Self 
sets  itself apart  but  more  as  populating  a  world  of which  the  Self  is  a  part just  like 
‘anyone’  else,  rendering  ‘being  in’  a  neutralising  ‘being-with’  (Heidegger  1953:  118). 
This structure of the  ‘being with’  the world  is the Man, a term  similar to  ‘one’  or ‘they’ 
signifying  a  general  something,  structuring  everyday  life  through  averageness  and 
levelling.  According  to  Heidegger,  the  Man  dominates  the  state  of being  -   the  Man 
“schreibt die Seinsart der Alltaeglichkeit vor” (Ibid.,  127) -  because it allows the Self to 
diffuse the issue of its own death by giving in to idle talk [Rede], curiosity [Neugier] and 

ambiguity/ambivalence  [Zweideutigkeit].  ‘Curiosity’  makes  the  Self  eager  to  disclose 
ever  more  of the  world,  which  is  made  accessible  through  ‘idle  talk’  and  ‘ambiguity’ 
enabling  loose  communication  (Ibid.,  167-175).  These  activities,  which  can  be  read  as 
encompassing those  everyday  routines,  allow  the  Self to  order  its world  with  reference 
to  the  Man  and  seemingly  allow  obtaining  knowledge  of  ‘everything’  and  suggesting 
that  everything  is  ‘in  order’  (Ibid.,  177).  Hence,  because  it  provides  comforting 
knowledge, the everyday structure of the Man is a fundamental trait of human existence.

However,  for  Heidegger,  the  downside  of this  kind  of  unfolding  is  that,  rather  than 
manifesting the  authentic  Self,  it places  ‘being’  in  a mode  of “groundless  floatation”,  a 
state  of  being-in  “everywhere  and  nowhere”  (Heidegger,  1953:  §37,  177).  Hence 
Heidegger  calls  this  process  Verfallen  [‘falling  away’]  which  designates  a  process  of 
crumbling,  decomposing,  or  loosing  quality.  Heidegger describes  it  as  a process  of the 

Self “getting lost in the public  [Offentlichkeit]  of Man” (Ibid,  175). Although Heidegger 
notes that,  analytically  speaking,  Verfallen  should  not be  seen  as  a negative  process  of 
‘falling down’  from a higher or more ‘pure’  state of being (Ibid., 43,  175f), also because 
it  is  impossible  to  know  the  latter,  it  is  clear  that  he  does  not  consider  Verfallen  a 
desirable process.  While by giving in to those temptations the  Self responds to its desire 
of overcoming anxiety and thereby unconsciously confirms  its own  being,  Heidegger is

174 For the following, see Heidegger (1953, §37).

108

clear that being “swirled  into the un-authenticity  [ Uneigentlichkeit]  of the Man” means 
moving away from the experience of authentic being (Ibid.,  179).175

A  major  reason  why  being  in  the  Man  is  inauthentic  is  that  that  it  is  based  on  a  thin 
conception of past and future. As Heidegger argues, the temporal structure of Verfallen -  
the temporal experience of being in the Man -  is the presence (Heidegger,  1953:  346). A 
Self lost in the everyday is characterised mainly by forgetfulness of what was and a by a 
lack  of genuine  engagement  with  what  could  be.  Everyday  practices  are  momentarily 
acts  which  make  the  presence  stand  out  more  sharply  and  which  allow  temporal 
orientation without paying attention to past and future.  Even when routines are  linked to 
a  ‘tradition’  and  seen  as an extension of ‘quality’  experiences passed  on through formal 
or  informal  rules,  by  themselves  routines  do  not  provide  a  source  for  meaningful 
orientation.  Similarly,  even  when  routines  are  seen  as  having  a  potential  to  endure  by 
being  institutionalised and thus reaching  into the future,  they do  not consider the future 
as  a  significant  place  in  and  of itself.  Instead,  routines  are  fundamentally  conservative 
and rest on the hope that the future will be like the present. While the future is not absent 
in  the  ontological  structure  of being  in  the  Man  -   after  all  Verfallen  as  a  response  to 
uncertainty/contingency  -   as  Heidegger  argues  a  Self  giving  in  to  the  “constant 
temptation  to  Verfallen”  (Heidegger,  1953:  177)  is  alienated  from  its  future  and 
dispersed in the presence (Ibid.,  §68c).  Existing in the “modus of the presence”  in which 
being  is  everywhere  and  nowhere,  the  Self is  in  a  state  of Aufenthaltslosigkeit  (Ibid., 
347).

The Anxiety Dilemma
While these critiques of scientific time and the everyday echo the Zeitgeist of the  1920s 
lamenting  a  dehumanization  of the  individual  in  the  industrial  age,  from  an  analytical 
perspective  the  temptation  of getting  lost  in  these  ‘calming’  temporal  orders  turns  the

175  Similarly,  Elias  notes  the  calming effect  of organizing temporal  space  in  universal  terms  as 
“people’s  attempts  to  run  away  from  themselves”  (Elias  1992:  84).  Note  that  Vefallen  differs 
from Marx’  notion of ‘alienation’  in  important ways:  For Marxists,  alienation  is  seen as  a result 
of economic structures built on  capitalist logic (and,  in the  Gramscian  variant,  with  ideology on 
top) controlled by the state and, thus, expression of a power structure which, if recognized by the 
oppressed,  could be overcome.  By contrast,  for Heidegger  Verfallen  is a process not imposed by 
some  political-economic  superstructure  but  something  chosen  by  the  individual,  an  inevitable 
consequence  of the  human  condition  in  search  for  ontological  security.  Although  by  speaking 
about temptations Heidegger opens up to the possibility to resist, this is more an internal struggle 
not  one  against  an  external  structure  such  as  the  state.  The  two  perspectives  are  combined  in 
Foucault’s  notion  of  ‘governmentality’  popular  among  poststructuralists.  The  problem  is  that 
their portrayal of the  linear/universal  conception of time as  a disciplining power structure of ‘the 
state’ (e.g., Edkins, 2003) leads to a pre-occupation with the theme of resistance which blends out 
the anxiety paradox and the subsequent dilemma which  Heidegger’s critique of the Man raises.

109

anxiety  paradox  into  a dilemma:  scientific  time  and  everyday  routines  may  function  as 
anxiety  controlling  mechanisms,  but  they  prevent  the  Self  from  becoming  authentic. 
They  provide  ontological  security  by  embedding  the  Self  into  structures  promising 
‘continuity’  and ‘simultaneity’  at the cost of authenticity, more precisely by reducing the 
possibility of having an  authentic experience (what Bergson called the  ‘fundamental’  or 
‘passionate’  Self).  The  two  seem  mutually  exclusive.  Elias  alludes  to  this  anxiety 
dilemma as the  ‘jaws of a trap’  which  studies  of time  inevitably come up against (Elias 
1992:  85).176

There are two possible  strategies to deal  with  the anxiety dilemma (apart from  ignoring 
it).  One is to accept it and,  like Heidegger, examine this paradoxical  state of being from 
all  angles  in  the  most detailed  manner.  The  other  strategy,  pursued  here,  is to  come  up 
with a view of how the  Self unfolds  into the world without getting lost to the everyday, 
the Man, by rethinking the possibility of ‘authentic (coming into) being’.

Rethinking Authenticity
The  way  out  of  the  anxiety  dilemma  offered  here  is,  first,  to  suggest  that  humans 
develop  a  desire  for  ‘authenticity’  to  control  (perhaps  even  take  away)  anxiety  and, 
second, to rethink how a state of authentic being is obtained.

Despite  his  normative  undertones,  Heidegger’s  discussion  in  Sein  und  Zeit  does  not 
suggest  that  the  unfolding  Self  is  driven  by  a  desire  for  authenticity.  Indeed,  his 
suggestion  that  Verfallen  is  the  desired  path  of  unfolding  is  what  gives  the  anxiety 
dilemma in the first place. One explanation  might be that the  Self does not want to  face 
death  because  it does  not want to  be reminded of its finitude.  Another,  more significant 
explanation  lies in Heidegger’s ambition to pursue a ‘fundamental ontology’ which rules 
out any preconceived wills, needs,  or desires.  However, there  is  no need to attribute the 
desire  for  authenticity  to  ‘human  nature’.  It  can  also  be  seen  as  emerging  out  of the 
human  condition.  All  one  needs  to  do  is  take  the  insight  that  humans  respond  to 
awareness  of  contingency  with  a  desire  for  continuity  and  add  to  this  a  desire  for 
authenticity.

Although  generally  remaining  on 
identified 
authenticity as a key force guiding people’s  lives, coming from two directions.  The first

level,  scholars  have 

the  normative 

176  How  to  conceive  of ‘time’  constructed  on  the  basis  of experience  occupied  phenomenology 
from Husserl onwards, who struggled with the question whether time is a priori or a construct of 
human consciousness, that is, whether we are in time or whether time is in us, see Dostal (1993).

110

suggests  that  becoming authentic  is  (would  be)  an  improvement  in  people’s  life  and  is 
desirable.  Charles Taylor, whose writings on the  Selfhood  are  influenced by Heidegger, 
notes  that  crucial  for  grounding  a  sense  of  Self  is  a  feeling  of  ‘doing  it  my  way’. 
Authenticity,  according  to  Taylor,  is  an  ideal  which  holds  that  “being  true  to  myself 
means  being  true  to  my  own  originality,  which  is  something  only  I  can  articulate...In 
articulating  it,  I  am  also  defining myself.  I  am  realizing a potential  that  is  properly my 
own” (Taylor  1994:  31). In correspondence with an unfolding perspective authenticity is 
understood  as  something that  is  to  be  realized,  and  this  realisation  is  something  which 
provides the  Self with  a  sense  of originality  (see  also  Guignon  2006).  The  suggestion 
that  humans  have  a  desire  for  authenticity  not  only  shines  through  in  the  normative 
undertones in  Heidegger’s writings but also in his support of the Nazi regime in the early 
1930s.  The regime’s claims of what  it meant to  be authentically  ‘German’  were greeted 
by  Heidegger,  who  considered 
the  National  Socialist  movement  a  ‘moment  of 
awakening’ for the German people.177

Coming  from  another  direction,  Adorno  criticizes  authenticity  as  a  dangerous  ‘jargon’ 
(Adorno 2003  [1964]).  More specifically, he criticizes the language of authenticity as an 
ideology  with  “theological  resonance”  permeating  public  discourse  enveloped 
in 
“judicial  garb”,  whose  pretence  of “closeness,  noble  and  homey at once”  is  intertwined 
with  unquestioned  assertions  of  “primalness”  (Ibid.,  xix,  3-7).  The  importance  of 
Adorno’s  warning  of  the  negative  consequences  of  authenticity  claims,  namely  the 
temptation to exclude,  discriminate,  and even eradicate the  ‘inauthentic’,  is  indisputable 
and  is echoed  in the radical constructivist critique of reifying conceptions of culture and 
essentialist claims of identity (Campbell  1998a; Zehfuss 2001; see also chapter six). This 
critique  is  not  a  case  against  the  influence  of the  discourse  of ‘authenticity’,  quite  the 
contrary.  By  noting  its  psychological  effect  of  strengthening  self-esteem  and  its 
capability  to  generate  an  “overflow  of  deep  human  emotion”  readily  (ab)used  as  a 
“means of power”, Adorno implies that there is a demand to feel  ‘authentic’  and that the 
ability to satisfy this demand is a source of power (Adorno 2003  [1964]:  xix, 3-7).

Including  a  desire  for  authenticity  in  the  causal  narrative  is  only  the  first  step.  The 
second and more laborious task is to conceptualise how this desire is satisfied, that is, to 
understand the basic parameters  in which authenticity claims are successfully made. For 
doing so it is useful to look once more at Heidegger, who, despite recognising the logical

individualism posed a paradox for Heidegger, visible in his tacit critique of Nazi bureaucracy.

the  totalising  character  of ■ this  narrative  which  eradicated  any  notion  of 

I l l

dead end he meets in the anxiety dilemma,178 spends considerable time (indeed the entire 
second  part of the book) discussing what authenticity might entail, that  is,  how  it might 
be  possible.179  To  recall,  for  Heidegger  (the  fear  of)  death  is  the  only  authentic 
experience,  and  so  the  only  point  at  which  authentic  being  is  logically  possible  is  the 
moment  at  which  the  Self faces  its  own  death  (Heidegger  1953:  §53).  As  he  puts  it 
“death  is  the  ownmost  (eigenste)  possibility  of  being”  (Ibid.,  263).  That  moment  of 
facing death does not refer to the actual experience, but to the understanding/recognition 
of being  as  ‘being-towards-death’  and  of death  as  the  end-state  after  which  being  is 
impossible.  In this  moment of understanding, the basic  sentiment of anxiety  is  replaced 
by  fear,  and  it  is  this  fear  which  pulls  the  Self out  of  its  “complacent  absorption  in 
everydayness” (Guignon 2006:  282) and signifies authentic disclosure allowing being to 
“finds itself’ (Heidegger  1953: 25Of, 268, 308).

It can be said that in Heidegger’s discussion of authenticity four features stand out.  First, 
authentic  disclosure/being,  conditioned  by  fear  of  ones  own  death,  is  an  exception, 
occurring  in  rare  moments  of vision  \Augenblick]  (Heidegger  1953:  190f.,  338).  Such 
moments  emerge suddenly  and  unexpectedly.180  Second,  authentic  being  is  an  isolating 
or  individualising  experience.  It  does  not  place  the  Self  in  an  empty  world  but  it 
designates a process of Singularization  [Vereinzelung]  (Heidegger  1953:  187ff,  336ff.). 
Third,  authentic  being  is  characterised  by a  distinctive temporal  structure  in  which  past 
and  future  are  meaningful  places,  in  contrast  to  the  inauthentic  existence  in  a  state  of 
Verfallen where the Self is dispersed in the presence and, fourth, authentic being endows 
the  Self with  resoluteness/resolve  [Entschlossenheit].  Recognising  the  possibilities  of 
being provides a ‘clear view’  of what is ahead and enables moving into the future with a 
sense of direction (Heidegger  1953,  §31,  §68a). In particular the latter two points inform 
Charles Guignon’s suggestion that

“Authenticity  is  characterised  by  a  distinctive  temporal  structure  (...)  an 
authentic  life  is  lived  as  a  unified  flow  characterized  by  cumulativeness 
and  direction.  It  involves taking over the  possibilities  made accessible  by 
the  past and  acting  in  the  present to accomplish  something for the future.
Or  to  rephrase  this  in  the  narrativist  mode,  such  a  life  is  lived  as  a 
coherent story” (Guignon 2006: 282f.)

178  See  Heidegger’s notes how the attempt to grasp being  in  its entirety “seems” to scheitem  on 
the structure of anxiety (Heidegger 1953: 233, 317).
179 According to Flynn (2006: 65) Heidegger coined the term.
180 Heidegger’s discussion  of how authentic disclosure  ‘happens’, that is,  how the  Self comes to 
fear  death  and  escape the  neutralising  experience  of the  Man,  is  difficult to  follow  (it  revolves 
around a “call  of conscience”  and the  acceptance  of guilt,  see  Heidegger  1953,  §55-  §60).  As I 
will  offer a different reading of authentic being and, consequently,  how authenticity  is obtained, 
engaging Heidegger on this point is not necessary.

112

My reformulation  of authentic  being presented  in the following chapters  rejects the  first 
two  of Heidegger’s  features  and  adopts  features  three  and  four,  which  are  compatible 
with Guignon’s characterisation.  Rejecting the first -  the notion that authenticity occurs 
in a sudden and rare moment -  is a consequence of the assumption made earlier that that 
the Self actively seeks authenticity.  Here arises the question how to combine a notion of 
authenticity  with  an  unfolding  perspective.  In  conjuncture  with  Taylor’s  notions  of 
‘articulation’  and  ‘realization’  of authenticity,  the  task  is  to  think  about  a  process  of 
authentic becoming, that  is,  about the generation of authenticity in  a creative process of 
living  life  as  a  coherent  story,  to  use  Guignon’s  words.  In  suggesting  what  this  may 
entail,  my  narrative  departs  from  Heidegger’s  focus  on  fear  of  death  as  the  only 
significant experience through which the Self can ‘find  itself, as well as from his notion 
that  authentic  becoming  is  a  process  of singularization.  Instead,  the  next  chapter  will 
sketch out the spatial and temporal parameters making up the ‘authentic’  life story of the 
Self,  what  will  be  called  a  national  biography.  The  subsequent  chapter (six)  will  argue 
that the originality of this story  is not articulated  in  isolation  but with  significant others, 
or friends.

CHAPTER FIVE:  THE STATE AS A NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY

through 

Summary
The  previous  chapter drew  on  Heidegger to  lay  out an  account of the  human  condition 
and  its  consequences  for  conceiving  of  (what  drives)  the  Self.  It  highlighted  an 
evolutionary  ontology  of the  Self in  a  process  of unfolding  and  suggested  that  being 
confronted with an uncertain future generates anxiety rather than fear.  It was argued that 
the  Self responds to this condition with a desire for continuity, that is,  for a stable sense 
of  ‘being-in-the-world’ 
the  generation  of  meaningful  knowledge  from 
experience.  The  chapter  concluded  with  arguing  that  the  attempt  to  control  anxiety  is 
expressed in a desire for ‘authentic becoming’. The present chapter has the dual purpose 
of substantiating these points and making them applicable to IR by conceptualizing what 
it means for the state to ‘exist’  in space and time. Using the opening of statehood resting 
on  a  ‘binding  idea’,  the  below  discussion  develops  a  reading  of the  state  as  a  national 
biography  defined  as  a  coherent  life  story  through  which  societies  gain  orientation  in 
‘the  world’  by  inscribing  space  and  time  with  meaning.  Against  this  backdrop,  the 
national  security  interest can  be  understood  as generating and  safeguarding an  authentic 
national  biography.

After  introducing  the  idea  of  a  national  biography,  the  chapter  substantiates  its 
parameters  in  two  parts.  The  first  half of the  chapter  is  devoted  to  discuss  the  spatial 
dimension. More  precisely,  it discusses the  spatial  embeddedness of ‘being’  through the 
notion  of an  ‘experienced  space’,  specified  analytically with  a taxonomy of centre/soul, 
valued  order  and  horizon.  It then  explores  the  usefulness  of existing frameworks  in  IR, 
such  as  empire,  milieu,  and  region  for  conceptualizing  the  state  as  situated  in  an 
‘experienced  space’.  The  second  half  of  the  chapter  then  addresses  the  temporal 
dimension of a national biography. Using the openings of the constitutive effect of ideas, 
learning, and the past as a guide for the future, it discusses the importance of (i) memory 
spaces  generated  by  ‘significant  experiences’  whose  emotional  impact  provides  the 
(national)  ‘Self  with  a  significant  place  in  the  past  and  whose  ambiguity provides  (ii) 
space for creative  learning of moral  lessons projected into the future as visions of order, 
or utopias.  Emphasizing the particular importance of the  latter, the chapter concludes by 
arguing  that  in  merging  the  two  the  Self (the  state)  turns  its  world  into  a  meaningful 
project providing it with direction and a sense of authentic becoming.

114

The State as a National Biography
To  conceptualize the  state  as  a reflexive  Self it  is  instructive to take  as  a  starting point 
Weber’s definition of the state as a community holding the monopoly over the legitimate 
use  of  force  in  a  certain  space  and  to  ask  what  holds  this  community  together. 
Answering  this  question  touches  on  the  phenomenon  of  nationalism.  As  the  term 
inter national  relations  suggests,  (the  idea  of)  the  nation  is  or,  rather,  should  be 
constitutive of IR scholarship.  While this task  is taken up by IR scholars roughly once a 
decade,181  generally speaking it has become a habit in IR to collapse the  ‘nation’  into the 
‘state’  and  make  the  former  disappear,  resurfacing  only  when  nationalist  aspirations 
were identified as a source of conflict and disorder undermining rather than carrying ‘the 
system’.  Yet  some  understanding  of (the  idea  of)  the  nation’  certainly  matters  for  a 
theory  trying  to  come  to  terms  with  the  concept  of a  ‘national  interest’,  at  least  if one 
accepts Wolfers’  point that “the national  interest  indicates that the  policy  is designed to 
promote  demands  that  are  ascribed  to  the  nation”  (Wolfers  1962:  147).  In  light  of the 
discussion  in  the  previous  chapter,  this  demand  can  be  understood  as  ‘controlling 
anxiety’  by generating a stable sense o f ‘authentic becoming’.

Shifting the focus back to  ‘the nation’  is not a straightforward task.  Most importantly,  it 
is  useful  to  heed  the  advice  of  scholars  of  nationalism  and  distinguish  between  an 
analysis  trying  to  discern  the  features  of a  nation  and  a  study  of the  phenomenon  of 
nationalism. The former assumes the existence of a certain  group or community with  or 
without  a direct  link  to  a  state  understood  as  a territorially  exclusive  entity,  if anything 
considered  more  basic  and  preceding,  indeed,  claiming  ‘their  own’  state  (nation  -> 
state).  By  contrast,  an  analysis  of dynamics  of nationalism  focuses  on  how  the  state 
understood as a structure of governmental authority  is able to create and manipulate the 
‘idea  of the  nation’  which  otherwise would  not  exist (state 
nation).  Another way  of 
framing  the  debate  is  that  it  is  about  what  holds  communities  together,  with  views 
oscillating  between  (i)  the  realist/primordialist  position  emphasizing  intrinsic  or  fixed 
properties  such  as  ethnicity  and  (ii)  the  constructivist/modernist  position  emphasizing 
that nations are  ‘imagined’ and formed by things that can  be  learned. In both  frames the 
debate is about who comes first, the chicken (state) or the egg (nation).182

three,  both  Carr  (1945)  and  Morgenthau

nations/nationalism.  So  have  Deutsch  (1966),  Bloom  (1990);  Buzan  (1991);  Hall  (1999);  Laitin 
(2007).  The study of nationalism  is  intrinsically linked to the study o f ‘national  identity’  (Bloom 
1990;  Smith  1991),  yet  constructivist  discussions  of  the  latter  often  do  not  make  this  link 
(Katzenstein  1996).
182  A  classic  treatment  is  Gellner (1983).  For  an  overview  of classic  texts,  see  Hutchinson  and 
Smith  (1994);  also  Smith  (1998).  For  first  position  see  Smith  (1986),  for the  second  Brubaker 
(1996; also Anderson 2006).

115

The  perspective  taken  in  this  chapter  is  of  the  constructivist  kind,  emphasizing 
nationalism  as  a phenomenon  created,  substantiated  and  sustained  by  political  practice. 
It  focuses  on  the  state  as  a governmental  authority which  administers,  manipulates  and 
represents a certain  ‘binding  idea’  of a nation and  is  held  accountable for the  protection 
of the  same by  its  constituency.  Understood  as an  unfolding and  politically contestable 
idea,  the  conception  also  overlaps  with  Herder’s  view  of  the  nation  as  mobile 
community  whose  sense  of order  is  “continuously  renovated  in  terms  of the  needs  of 
each  generation”  (in  Hutchinson  1987:  13).  This  ‘accountability’  qualifier  is  important 
insofar  as  it  tames  the  constructivist  position  in  assuming  that  governments  can 
manipulate  the  idea  only within  certain  limits  acceptable to  society.  Hence,  it  does  not 
entirely discard of the idea of a nation as a living thing and accepts the existence of what 
John  Hutchinson  (1987)  calls  “cultural  nationalism”.  I  will  return  to  this  point  when 
speaking about political agency at the end of this chapter.

The  constructivist  account presented  in  this  chapter engages the  concept,  mentioned  by 
Benedikt  Anderson,  of a  ‘biography  of nations’  through  which  communities  imagine 
their continuity in time (Anderson 2006:  205).183 Kenneth Boulding (1959:  122) captures 
something  similar  when  he  speaks  of a  “national  image”  which  “extends  through  time 
backwards into a supposedly recorded or perhaps mythological past and forward  into an 
imagined  future”  (also  Coker,  1989).  By  reading  the  state  through  the  concept  of  a 
national  biography, this  chapter  also  makes  use  of Erik  Ringmar’s  suggestion,  drawing 
on  Paul  Ricoeur, who  in turn  was  influenced  by Heidegger, to conceptualize the state as 
a  narrative.184  Taking  up  the  view  that  “when  we  wonder who  we  are...we  tell  a  story 
which  locates  us  in  the  context  of a  past,  a  present  and  a  future”  Ringmar argues  that 
while  ‘the  state’  may not be  empirically  verifiable,  “the  spirit of the  nation  does  leaves 
its  trace  in  time” (Ringmar  1996:  451,  454).  This  chapter  substantiates these  claims  by 
exploring the  idea  of ‘Germany-in  the  world’  or  ‘America-in-the-world’  and,  by  doing 
so,  adds that a nations’  ‘trace  in time’  cannot  be  meaningfully  separated  from  its  ‘trace 
in space’.

Carving  out  the  parameters  of  a  national  biography  builds  on  the  insight  that  ideas 
impact  how  states,  or  rather,  those  who  represent  them  conceive  of their  (respective 
state’s)  place  in  ‘the  world’.  At  least  since  Robert Jervis’  (1976)  work  on  the  effect  of 
belief systems  on  foreign  policy  making,  scholars  have  shown  that  ideas  introduce  a

183 The concept is also mentioned in passing by Steele (2005).
184 On the ‘narrative’  approach see also White (1987), applied to IR by Campbell (1998b, Ch. 3).

116

‘cognitive  bias’  among  decision  makers  in  their  perception  of ‘the  world’.185  Yet  most 
studies in  IR are concerned with demonstrating that ideas matter, they rarely engage the 
question  which  ideas  matter,  why  they  matter  and  where  they  come from ,  let  alone 
embed the answers in an ontology of the state.186 This chapter addresses these questions 
by  presenting  ideas  as  an  integrative  element  of a  national  biography,  specifically  as 
providing  anxiety-controlling  mechanisms  through  authentic  meaning  structures  which 
enable the state to situate itself in space and time.

Parameters of Authenticity I: Unfolding in Space
This  section  discusses  the  spatial  dimension  of a  national  biography.  Although  some 
promising avenues are discussed further below, IR’s reliance on the Hobbesian ontology 
provided  little  incentive  for  scholars to  rethink the  spatial  features  of the  state.  Content 
with  it  as  a  clearly  delineated  and  exclusive  territory  easily to  locate  on  any  (political) 
map,  the  problematization  of this  space  and  spatial  theorizing  more  generally  has  been 
left to critical  geographers who,  in turn, draw on social theory and philosophy to rethink 
space  outside/beyond  the  state.187  Although,  despite  the  recognition  that  “spatial 
orientation  lies  very  deep  in  the  human  psyche”  (Taylor  1989:  28) among philosophers 
the role of space in the formation of Selfhood also has been somewhat neglected. As one 
scholar puts  it,  “the exclusive focus on the w/zo-question (“who am  I?”) has often  made 
philosophy  forget  the  correlate  where-question.  All  the  answers  given  to  the  first 
question  describe  a  [Self]  which  is  essentially  nowhere”  (Manoussakis,  2007:  674).  In 
seeking an answer to the whereabouts of the  Self,  it is useful to return to Heidegger and 
his notion of being as unfolding in space.

As  noted  in  the  previous  chapter,  for Heidegger “the ontologically properly  understood 
‘subject’,  the  Dasein,  is  in  an  original  sense  spatial”  (Heidegger  1953:  111).  And  the 
Selfs  unfolding  into  ‘the  world’  and  disclosing  it  by  rendering  it  meaningful  is  not 
merely a  spiritual  or  imagined  process  (Heidegger  1953:  106,  110).  That  is, just as  the 
Self  is  not  simply  formed  by  stuff  (events,  people,  etc)  populating 
its  spatial

(2005).
186 As  noted  in the  last  chapter,  even constructivists such  as  Wendt who strongly  emphasize the 
“constitutive effect” of ideas on the self-conception of states don’t see them working ‘all the way 
down’  (Wendt  1999:  Ch.  3).  Systematic  attempts  such  as  by  Judith  Goldstein  and  Robert 
Keohane (1993)  fail  to  anchor the  notion that  ideas  help to  order the  world by  providing “road 
maps”  or  “focal  points”  in  a  deep  theory  of international  politics  and  end  up  treating  them  as 
‘intervening variables’.
187  For  classic  treatments,  see  Simmel  (1922);  Bollnow  (1963);  Lefebvre  (1991).  For  recent 
engagements, see Agnew (2003); Sparke (2005).  On the (missing) conversation between political 
scientists  and  geographers,  see  the  contributions  in  Political  Geography  18(8),  1999  and,  more 
recently, Mamadouh and Dijkink (2006).

surroundings, the world  is not a vacuum  into which the  individual  projects  its  ideas,  i.e. 
something  ‘empty’  that  is  gradually  ‘filled’.  Instead,  the  space  is  a  dynamic  ‘living’ 
mass,  something  that  provides  stimulus  and  opportunities  for  the  creation  of meaning 
structures and, thus, for ‘self-realization’.188

this 

‘inner’  and 

‘outer’  worlds, 

This  has  tempted  Hubert  Dreyfus  to  analytically  split  Heidegger’s  ontology  into  an 
‘objective’  space  the  Self in  inhabiting  and  an  ‘existential’  space  in  which  the  Self is 
getting  involved  (Dreyfus,  1991).  Yet  as  Malpas  (2006:  77-83)  points  out,  this 
distinction risks loosing much of the value of Heidegger’s topology. While Heidegger at 
one  point  makes  a  distinction  between 
is  a 
methodological  step  in  his argument to  show that the two  meet in the experience  rather 
than a distinction carrying his fundamental ontology. Heidegger endorses the notion of a 
‘subjective’  world  where  a  concept  like  ‘nature’  must  be  seen  as  part  of  the  Selfs 
conceptualization  of  ‘the  world’.  Assuming  ‘nature’  as  something  ontologically 
independent  skips  the  basic  question  of how  the  phenomenon  of worldliness  in  which 
something  like  ‘nature’  matters,  emerges  in  the  first place  (Heidegger  1953:  64).  More 
broadly speaking, for  ‘things’  to be considered part of ‘the world’, they have to become 
part  of the  spatial  conception  of the  Self.  As  Malpas  puts  it,  the  ‘objective/existential’ 
distinction  only  leads  to  the  question  of  how  the  two  spaces  relate  to  each  other 
conceptually,  the  answer  to  which  would  need  to  be  that,  from  the  perspective  of the 
Self,  they  are the  same (Malpas,  2006:  81).  For  instance,  while  it  could  be  argued  that 
the  ‘objective’/ ‘existential’  distinction  is  analytically  useful  to  explain  how  the  ‘same’ 
event  is  experienced  differently  by  different  individuals,  this  actually  does  not  require 
the  notion  of  an  ‘objective’  world.  If  the  world  only  becomes  intelligible  through 
disclosure  by  the  Self,  then  the  difference  is  not  merely  a  matter  of  ‘perspective’  or 
‘angle’ on the  ‘same’  event.  Because the meaning of the event is only constituted  in the 
relation  between  the  event  and  the  experiencing  subject,  it  is  unique.  From  that 
perspective, there is nothing like the ‘same’  event, it is actually a different one.

a

‘withdraw from’  its world

the  Self.  Heidegger uses terms such as the  ‘surrounding’  space (Umraum),  ‘surrounding 
field’  (Umfeld) or the  ‘surrounding world’/environment ( Umwelt) (Heidegger,  1953:  63, 
66,  102f.)  to  capture  that  space  the  Self has  disclosed  and  filled  with  meaning.  This  is 
the  space the  Self has  come to  know and  which  is,  therefore,  ‘around’  or  ‘close to’  the 
Self. As this closeness is constituted by experience, one could also refer to that particular 
environment which the  Self has  come to  ‘know’  as the  ‘experienced  space’.  This  is the 
terminus used here.

The ‘Experienced Space’
The  notion  of the  experienced  space  is  taken  from  Otto  Friedrich  Bollnow  (1963)  and 
Reinhard  Koselleck (1985:  271f.),  both  of whom  were  students  of Heidegger.  Whereas 
Koselleck remains in the temporal dimension and uses the term akin to that of a memory 
space,  discussed  below,  Bollnow  focuses  on  the  spatiality  of the  concept.  He  shares 
Heidegger’s  view  that  the  human  conception  of  and  relation  to  ‘space’  must  be 
understood  differently  from  the  mathematical/geometrical  Cartesian  one,  and  that  such 
space  is  neither  external  to  the  human  nor  something  purely  ‘spiritual’  or  ‘imagined’. 
Instead,  it  is  a  space  in  which  ‘life  happens’.  With  the  terminus  ‘living  space’ 
[.Lebensraum]  contaminated  by the  politics  of Nazi  Germany,  Bollnow  replaces  it  with 
that  of  the  ‘lived  space’  [erlebter  Raum]  (Bollnow  1963:  18f.),  which  can  also  be 
translated as ‘experienced space’  [erfahrener Raum or Erfahrungsraum].m

To  be  sure,  the  term  is  not  ideal,  for  two  reasons.  First,  as  discussed  further  down  in 
more  detail,  it  does  not  quite  capture  that  Erlebnis -   a  term  which  as  Gadamer  (2004 
[1975]:  53f.) points out arises out of the biographical  literature -  designates not just any 
experience  [.Erfahrung]  but one which  leaves a deep and  lasting  ‘impression’.190 Yet the 
space  in which authentic being unfolds  is not based on an everyday experience but only 
on  those  experiences  which  are  in  some  sense  ‘significant’.  Second,  by  linking  the 
definition of the space to (significant) experiences,  it gives the impression that the space 
is  defined  primarily  through  the  past.  Yet  as  the  discussion  of the  temporal  dimension 
below will argue, the way the space is envisioned is just as if not more significant, hence

189 This reading of space  is different from Henri  Lefebvre’s Marxist-inspired attempt to combine 
physical,  mental,  and  social  dimensions  into  a  universal  theory  of “produced  space”  (Lefebvre 
1991;  Elden  2001).  Although  some  of Lefebvre’s  insights  are  useful,  in  particular  if read  with 
Elden  (2004),  as  a  critical  engagement  with  Heidegger  and  existentialism  more  generally,  his 
thrust towards revealing universal structures (economic or otherwise) does not suit the subjective 
perspective taken here.
190  Note  that  Erlebnis  can  be  read  as  the  significant  experience  of  an  event,  or  happening 
[Ereignis],  which  is  semantically  closely  linked to the  German  term  authentic  [eigentlich]  used 
by  Heidegger and which  links  authenticity,  understood  as  ‘being one’s own  [eigenY  to  an  event 
one owns (see also Malpas 2006:  58).

it  also  must  accommodate  the  notion  of an  envisioned  or  expected  space.  With  those 
limitations  in  mind,  the  discussion  will  employ the  notion  of the  ‘experienced  space’. 
Loosely  following  Bollnow,  the  features  of this  space  are  a  centre  (or  soul)  through 
which the Self evaluates and orders ‘its’ world along value horizons.

Centre: Feeling  ‘at Home*
To  begin with,  if the experiences space contains the  notion of a  ‘surrounding’  space this 
suggests  that  there  must  be  something  like  a  centre.  As  understood  here,  this  centre  is 
not simply a physical  but an emotional  location, a place which has something ‘familiar’ 
to  it  which  lends  it  “a  character  of trustworthiness”  (Bollnow,  1963:  55ff).  It  is  also 
captured  by  understanding  being  as  inhabiting something,  as  residing  or  dwelling  in  a 
specific place.191  Heidegger  is  known  for  having  emphasised  the  notion  of ‘dwelling’, 
which  is  generally  associated  with  living  in  the  specific  place  that  is  ‘home’  or  a 
‘house’.192 When Bollnow notes “only by dwelling in a house can the human be at home 
in  the  world,  can  he  also  dwell  in  the  world”  (Ibid.,  148)  he  echoes  Heidegger’s 
statement that “to be human means: to be on earth as a mortal, means: to dwell” (cited in 
Bollnow,  1963:  126).  A  German term  capturing the  significance  of a  place  is  Heimat, 
where familiarity is attributed  in a more abstract way than  ‘home’  and can be applied to 
the  local,  the  region,  and  the  nation  (Confino,  1997:  9).  A  place  considered  Heimat  is 
primarily associated with an emotional state, designating a place rising out of a feeling, a 
Heimatgefuehl, which  in the broadest sense could  be translated as feeling at  ‘home’  (see 
also Applegate  1990).  For Gaston  Bachelard,  on  whom  Bollnow  also  draws,  the  notion 
of the home contains “one of the greatest powers of integration” without which a human 
would  be  a  “dispersed  being”.  Bachelard  links  the  home  to  the  ‘soul’  as  the  place  of 
emotional  being,  which  he  explicitly  differentiates  from  the  cognitive  function  of the 
mind. While he sees mind and soul inseparable for the overall experience o f ‘being’, it is 
the soul where the world ‘reverberates’ (Bachelard,  1994:  7).

Whether the notion of the place is grasped  in terms of home, Heimat, or soul, the centre 
designates the  place through  which  the  Self organises  its  unfolding.  Consequently,  this 
centre is not permanent/static but a creative/evolving place. For Bachelard the soul  is the 
site  of an  “inner  light”  which  does  not  reflect  ‘the  world’  but,  rather,  where  ‘intimate 
meanings’  are  created  and  recognized,  where  worlds  are  inaugurated,  which  makes

191  For  comprehensive  discussions  of the  philosophy  of place  and  its  link  to  experience,  with 
particular focus on Heidegger, see Malpas (1999, 2006), also Casey (1997).
192  On  Heidegger’s  notion  of  dwelling,  see  Malpas  (2006:  74ff).  It  is  no  coincidence  that 
‘dwelling’ (or the German wohneri) is often used synonymous to (or translated as) ‘living’

120

‘home’  an  intimate  place  (Bachelard,  1994:  10).  It  is  a  place  where  the  Self  ‘knows’ 
itself best,  the  centre  of familiarity,  where  it  can  feel  comfortable  and  emotionally  ‘at 
peace’.193  Yet  it  is  not  merely  a  place  of shelter  and  withdrawal,  but  of creativity  and 
engagement, with the potential  for happiness and the good life (Bollnow,  1963:  132).194 
In  the  words  of  Iris  Marion  Young,  the  ‘home’  is  “the  site  of the  construction  and 
reconstruction  of the  Self’ (Young,  2001:  286).  This reading of ‘home’  as  a  place  from 
which  world  building occurs  ties  in  with  Heidegger’s conceptualisation  of building not 
only  as  constructing  but  also  as  cultivating  something,  which  means  that  the  idea  of 
‘preserving’  is  not entirely discarded;  although  clearly the  notion  of building  it  is  not  a 
conservative enterprise (Young, 2001: 225).

Finally,  reading the center as a  ‘soul’  links the reading of Selfhood  inscribed  into  space 
back  to  ancient  Greek  thought  where  having  a  soul  was  understood  to  be  the  very 
indicator of being alive (and where, correspondingly, the departure thereof was taken as 
the  evidence  of  death).  The  soul  was  not  only  considered  a  harbour  of  emotions, 
feelings,  and  perceptions;  a  ‘strong’  soul  was  also  an  indicator  for acts  of courage  and 
determination  and  for  morally  significant  behaviour  (Lorenz,  2003),  characteristics 
echoed  in  Heidegger’s notion of the  ‘resolve’  of authentic being.  And Plato’s claim that 
the  soul  can  be  made  immortal  by  inscribing  it  into  the  good  order  of  the  polis, 
mentioned  in  the  previous  chapter,  leads  over to the  second  feature  of the  experienced 
space,  namely  that  the  process  of gaining  orientation  in  space  is  a  process  of creating 
order (Bollnow,  1963:  36).

Order:  The Valued Space
The  argument  that  the  Self  is  formed  through  identification  with  an  ‘order’  is  well- 
established  in  social  theory,  indeed  has  been  central  to  Western  thought  since  Plato 
(Strong  1992:  8,  see  also  Baumann  1991).  Perhaps just  as  long-standing  is  the  debate

193  It  is  important  not  to  read  causal  narratives  attributing  importance  to  such  places  (home, 
Heimat,  soul) as a regression  into romanticism or even reactionary thinking.  Young’s defence of 
the  idea  of ‘home’  against  feminist  criticism  of the  same  nicely  shows  that  it  is  a  mistake  to 
automatically  associate  attempts  linking  understandings  of Selfhood  to  a  place  like  ‘home’  as 
supporting an exclusionary and essentializing understanding of Selfhood. Echoing the point made 
about  authenticity  in  the  previous  chapter,  Malpas  reminds  that  “the  real  question...is just  how 
place  should  be  understood”,  which  he  rightly  suggests  is  “a  pressing  question  because  of the 
way  in  which  place,  and  notions  associated  with  place  [such  as  authenticity]  are  indeed  given 
powerful  political  employment  across  the  political  spectrum”  (Malpas  2006:  26f.).  In  other 
words,  it  is  to  take  serious  the  political  implications  of  what  Gaston  Bachelard  has  called 
‘topophilia’, or love of place, as an anxiety controlling mechanism.
194  It  only  has  the  potential  because  the  centre’s  familiarity  is  generated  by  significant 
experiences which are not necessarily positive (see below).

whether  order  rests  (or  should  rest)  on  norms  or values.195  .  The  interplay  between  the 
‘good’  and  the  ‘right’  and  how  they  (should)  relate  is  subject  to  much  debate  among 
social  theorists  (Joas  2000:  161 f),  yet  frequently  brushed  over  by  IR  scholars.196  The 
distinction is important when it comes to understand what makes space meaningful.

life.  Norms  are  seen  as  necessary 

The  emphasis on  norms is heavily influenced  by social  contract thinking and the related 
advocacy  of  specific  but  potentially  universally  valid  rules  of  behaviour  to  organize 
social 
through 
understandings of what  is the  ‘right’  thing to do,  such  as  stopping at red  lights,  guiding 
the  S elfs  activities  along  a  ‘logic  of appropriateness’.  Leaving  aside  the  notion  of a 
coercive order (as  in Hobbes), the  importance of norms for constituting Selfhood  is said 
to  be  found  in  their cognitive-regulative function.  As  such,  respect for norms may well 
be  ‘neutral’  or  ‘soulless’  in  the  sense  that  little  emotional  significance  is  attached  to 
them.  By  themselves,  norms  understood  as  rules  are  not  sufficient  to  inscribe  a  space 
with  significant structures  of meaning.  This  is  done  by values.197  As  Kratochwil  (1989: 
64)  notes,  values  are  more  general  than  norms,  or  rules,  and  inform  attitudes  and 
generate emotional attachment. Having values allows for moral judgments guided by an 
understanding  of the  ‘good’  (Joas  2000:  21).  As  such,  values  rank  the  importance  or 
quality of something,  including a norm, and are attributed to things which satisfy desires 
and  create  a  ‘good’  feeling,  stirring  emotions.  Values  may  find  expression  in,  or  lend 
support to, certain norms. Yet while one can imagine an abundance of possible norms, or 
rules,  tied  to  and  varying  with  specific  contexts,  values  go  deeper  and  are  about 
evaluating  which  norms  serve  as  the  Selfs  primary  orientation  devices  and  create  the 
‘good’  feeling.  Hence,  it is not that norms don’t matter but,  rather, that they are tailored 
towards  (attached  to)  a certain  value.  The  Self unfolds  into the  experienced  space  with 
an idea of what is a ‘good’ order, thereby making the space meaningful.

For  Heidegger a  meaningful  space  is  one  in  which  ‘things  have their place’  and  where 
distance  to  the  Self is  not  measured  in  physical  proximity  but  according  to  the  value 
attributed  to  things  (wertbehaftet)  (Heidegger,  1953:  63,  66,  102f.).  Similarly,  Simmel 
suggests  that  space  obtains  significance  through  the  classification  of its  ‘parts’  carried 
out  by  the  soul  (Simmel,  1922:  461).  The  view  that  being-in-space  gains  significance 
through  attachment  to  a  conception  of  ‘the  good’  is  also  captured  by  Charles  Taylor

195 On how the interplay between  values and norms, between the  ‘good’  and the ‘right’, and how 
they (should) relate is subject to much debate among social theorists (Joas 2000:  161 f).
196 Most notably, Bull (2002) mixes norms and values as elements of order.
197 For a detailed discussion, see Joas (2000).

(1989).  For  Taylor,  having  a  sense  of Self means  knowing  an  answer  to  the  question 
‘what  kind  of  life  is  worth  living’  and  to  make  what  he  calls  ‘strong  evaluations’. 
Consequently,  human  beings  aspire  to  be  connected  to  what  they  consider  good  or  of 
fundamental value (Taylor,  1989:  42). Taylor suggests that we should see the process of 
‘value-orientation’  as one of Self-positioning in a “moral space”, which he defines as “a 
space in which questions arise about what is good or bad, what is worth doing and what 
not,  what  has  meaning  and  importance  for  you  and  what  is  trivial  and  secondary” 
(Taylor,  1989:  28).198  In  this  sense,  gaining  orientation  in  space,  “‘value-ceiving’ 
(Wertnehmen) always precedes ‘perceiving’  (Wahrnehmen)” (Scheler cited in Joas 2000: 
88) and is always also an emotional orientation (Bollnow  1963; Unger  1990).

Horizons: Delineating the Possible
The third feature engages the understanding that spatial orientation requires some sort of 
boundary,  or  border  (Simmel  1922:  465f).  As  discussed  in  the  previous  chapter,  for 
realism  and,  indeed,  for  any theorist trying to  conceptualize  ‘the  state’,  the  delineating 
function  of  a  border  is  central  to  conceive  of an  ‘entity’  at  all.  It  differentiates  one 
territorial  claim  from  another.  Similarly,  constructivists  consider the  concept  of border 
as  indispensable  because  it  captures  the  attempt  of the  Self to  differentiate  between 
appropriate  and  inappropriate  behavior,  making  the  concept  of the  ‘border’  form  an 
analytical  triad  together with  ‘identity’  and  ‘order’  (Lapid,  2001).  Whether this  process 
of  ‘bordering’  must  be  problematized  as  a  phenomenon  of  exclusion,  as  most 
constructivist literature suggests, depends very much on how the  Self-Other relationship 
is  conceptualized,  which will  be discussed  in the next chapter.  For now, the  question  is 
how to conceive of the boundary of an unfolding Self situated  in  an  ‘experienced’  space 
without dependency on an ‘Other’.

Bollnow  suggests that space always features  both  sharp  borders and  gradual transitions, 
that a world  is ordered through clearly delineated features and at the same time is infinite 
and  open  for  exploration  and  discovery.  The  sharp  borders  could  be  seen  as  those 
cognitive-regulative  railings  which  help  the  Self  to  stay  on  a  certain  path  in  the 
everyday,  yet the  path  is  coming  from  somewhere  and  is  leading  to  somewhere,  from 
and  to places not clearly defined.  It  is  here where,  from  an  unfolding perspective, those 
‘transitionary markers’ play a crucial role. Indeed, if understood as delineating the moral 
space,  they  are  of primary  importance  for  the  Selfs  orientation  in  space  and  are  best 
understood  as  horizons  (Bollnow,  1963:  74-80,  Koselleck  1985:  273;  Gadamer  2004

198 See also Campbell (1998a); Reus-Smit (1998). Note that for Taylor the moral space is devised 
in-relation to others. The relational dimension will be taken up in the next chapter.

123

[1975]).  The  horizon  has  the  peculiar  character  as  both  limiting  the  possibility  of 
perception/experience  and  something  that  can  never  be  reached,  or  surpassed.  In  this 
sense,  the  ‘horizon’  is  an  existential  border,  delineating  realm  of  ones  unfolding 
existence and, thus, delineating the world that is known to be possible.

Precisely because of its  indeterminacy in the human experience, because of its unfolding 
character,  the  horizon  is  not a boundary that  constrains  but one that  invites  or,  at  least, 
holds  the  possibility  to  explore  and  change/open  new  perspectives,  without  ever 
disappearing.  In  correspondence  with  the  discussion  so  far,  the  horizon  is  understood 
here  in  terms  of  value-creating  experience,  making  it  a  ‘value  horizon’,  which  may 
expand  and  contract,  characterizing  the  Self  through  a  ‘wide’  or  ‘narrow’  horizon 
(Bollnow,  1963:  75).  From this perspective, the horizon  is not delineating space against 
something  but  is  simply  marking  the  realm  of the  familiar,  the  possible,  as  creating  a 
‘comfort  zone’  in  which  the  Self can  tame  anxiety.199  It  both  fixes  and  fosters  spatial 
imagination and in that sense is an invitation for devising a project that has no ‘end’.

Thinking Space ‘beyond’ Westphalia
How to translate this conceptualisation  of the  Self unfolding  in  an  experienced  space to 
IR?  Are  there  any  frameworks  going  ‘beyond’  Westphalia  one  can  build  on?  At  first 
sight,  the  conceptual  landscape  appears  not  very  promising.  The  general  observation 
made  by  Harold  and  Margaret  Sprout  that  the  ‘environmental’  terminology  used  by 
scholars of international  politics  is vague still  holds true (Sprout and  Sprout  1965:  5ff). 
In  most  IR  scholarship  the  .‘environment’  is  generally  understood  as  the  ‘external’ 
dimension, that what  is  outside the  state,  and  reduced to the  presence  of other  ‘actors’, 
mainly other states. And, if anything, the understanding of Selfhood attached to a certain 
space/place  has  evaporated  in  the  wake  of postmodemity.  Selfhood  in  what  Baumann 
tellingly calls  ‘liquid  modernity’  is  seen  as fluid  and disconnected  from  a specific  sense 
of  place  and,  correspondingly,  the  state  is  conceptualised  by  emphasising  its  spatial 
diffusion.  While  scholars  have scrutinized the political  construction  of borders to reveal 
the  contingency  of the  spatial  categories  modem  IR  continues  to  operate  in,  they  have 
done  so  without  rethinking the  situatedness  of the  state  in  ‘the  world’.200  Indeed,  most 
contemporary  attempts  to  expand  IR’s  reading  of  political  spaces  are  trying  to 
understand the extension of what calls “systems of rule” (Ruggie  1993) beyond the state,

199  An  important  question  here  is  whether  ‘borders’  are  defining  desirable  behaviour  (making 
everything else inappropriate) or inappropriateness (making everything else ‘normal’).

thereby  often  loosing  sight  of the  state  altogether.201  That  said,  there  are  three  areas 
where  scholars  of international  politics  have  devised  perspectives  which  provide useful 
entry points for conceptualising the state as an  experienced  space,  namely those dealing 
with phenomena or ‘empire’,  ‘milieu’  and ‘regionalism’.

From Empire to Milieu
The  notion of ‘empire’  most obviously  invites a rethinking of spatial boundaries beyond 
the state, perhaps even denoting a special kind of ‘state’. That said, the conceptualisation 
of  ‘empire’  is  much  debated  and  preoccupied  with  the  nature  of  control  outside  the 
‘core’  state  rather  than  the  ontological  configuration  of  the  same.  The  distinction 
between  territorial  or  non-territorial  manifestation,  as  in  the  traditional  distinctions  of 
land (e.g.,  Russia) and maritime empires (e.g., Britain),  has grown more complex  in the 
question  over the  nature  of American  hegemony,  with  scholars  emphasizing US  global 
military 
spread  of 
consumer/popular  culture.  While  Gramscian  and  Foucauldian  frameworks  offer  new 
ways of ‘tracing’  empire, the  spatial  configuration  of empire, more precisely the spatial
situatedness  of  states  within  it  is  overshadowed  by  questions  of  (how  to  measure)
power.

Political  geographers  in  Britain  and  Germany  in  the  late  19th  century  spoke  to  the 
imperial  ambitions  of  their  governments  and  developed  concepts  used  for  mapping 
spatial  spheres  of  influence  and  areas  of  strategic  (‘vital’)  importance.  In  Britain, 
Halford  Mackinder’s  notion  of the  Heartland  stressed the  idea of space as  “the  stake  of 
the struggle between human collectivities” and thus of space as a contested terrain (Aron 
1966:  198).  In  Germany,  Friedrich  Ratzel  developed  conceptual  ideas  for the  study  of 
the  state  as  a  spatial  phenomenon  influenced  by  social  Darwinism  and  suggested  to 
conceive  of the  state  as  a  living organism  and  identified  ‘space’  and  ‘position’  as  “the 
two  principle  determinants  of  the  fortunes  of  states”  (Parker  1995:  170).  This  was 
married  to  notion  of Lebensraum,  or  living  space,  the  ‘adequate  acquisition’  of which 
was,  according  to  Ratzel,  of  fundamental  importance  to  provide  society  with  the

emerging  above  and  beyond  ‘states’  without  rethinking  the  spatial  configuration  of  ‘states’ 
themselves  (Ferguson  and  Jones,  2002).  An  exception  is  Michael  Mann,  whose  reading  of 
‘globalisation’  suggests that states are  intertwined with those  ‘new’  political  spaces (Mann  1997; 
Weiss  2005).  Mann’s  view  is  close  to  (in  his  case  not  coincidentally)  the  spatial  thinking  one 
finds in the literature on  ‘empire’.

resources necessary to develop  its  potential  (O Tuathail,  1998:  4,  20f).  Intertwined with 
the  racial  ideology  of  National  Socialism  and  providing  a  justification  for  Hitler’s 
expansionist-destructive  agenda,  Ratzel’s  notion  of  Lebensraum  and 
the  related 
Grossraum  concept  used  by  Karl  Haushofer  and  Carl  Schmitt  became  highly 
problematic concepts after  1945.203

Disconnected  concept  from  Nazi  ideology the  Grossraum  concept  is  notable,  however, 
as an attempt to think about spatial situatedness of the state beyond Westphalia. As Aron 
points  out,  when  Schmitt  spoke  about  Raumsinn  or  ‘sense  of  space’  he  captured 
something important, namely “the  image which  man  [sic]  have made for themselves of 
their habitat” (Aron,  1966:  207).  Whatever the character of this habitat,  it highlights that 
communities perceive/sense their existence as bound up with a broader environment that 
means something to them, whether the experiences generating this meaning are positive 
or  negative  (see  below).  Said  differently,  the  Grossraum  concept  captures  how  states 
identify with an environment beyond their designated territorial borders, whether it is the 
US  claiming the  Western  Hemisphere  as  its  ‘backyard’  under the  Monroe  doctrine  or, 
more  recently,  Russia  declaring  the  former  Soviet  states  as  forming  a  space  which  is 
neither foreign nor domestic but ‘Near Abroad’  (Trenin, 2002). A broader sense of space 
is  also  identifiable  amongst  former  subjects  of empire.  As  J.G.A.  Pocock  notes,  New 
Zealand’s  ‘national  existence’  was  long  situated  less  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  than  in 
imperial  area  devised  by  the  British  and  this  area  possessed  “a  consciously  preserved 
history” of British  culture of which New Zealanders “saw themselves as part” (Pocock, 
1997:  299).  This  notion  of being  situated  in  a  cultural  Grossraum  also  echoes  in  the 
suggestion that states may be part of a  ‘civilization’  (Huntington  1993).  However,  as  in 
Huntington’s  version,  the  ‘civilization’  concept  serves  primarily  to  cluster  ‘states’ 
according  to  vague  ‘cultural’  characteristics  and  offers  little  in  terms  of rethinking the 
spatial conception of the state (see, however, Jackson 2004, 2006).

A  more useful  concept which  re-imagines  the  spatial  situatedness  of the  state  untainted 
by  the  politics  of  imperial  domination  is  the  ‘milieu’,  put  forward  by  Harold  and 
Margaret  Sprout  (1965)  in  their  attempt to  bring  clarity  into  how  states  relate  to  their 
‘environment’.  The  ‘milieu’  is  broadly  defined  as  a  space  encompassing  human  and 
nonhuman,  intangible  and  tangible  factors  (Sprout  and  Sprout,  1965:  27).  On  whether 
one  can  (or  should)  think  of this  milieu  as  something  independent  from  the  state,  the 
Sprouts  make the  distinction  between  subjective  and  objective  worlds  and  suggest that

203 In Germany these terms remain banned from the conceptual vocabulary (Parker  1995:  172).

126

the  milieu  can  be  understood  either  as  a  “psychological  image”,  which  they  call  the 
‘psycho milieu’,  or as  something that exists  independently from  perception,  the  ‘milieu 
as is’ (Sprout and  Sprout,  1965:  28f).204 While from a phenomenological perspective this 
distinction  breaks  down,  the  subjective  character  of the  ‘psycho  milieu’  -   which  the 
Sprouts  acknowledge  is the one that matters  if one wants to explain  ‘decisions’  (Sprout 
and  Sprout,  1965:  30f)  -   comes  close  to  the  notion  of the  ‘experienced  space’,  except 
that  it  is a purely cognitive construct  lacking the emotional dimension  and the emphasis 
on values.

‘conditions’  human  existence,  via  what 

The  Sprouts  extensive  discussion  of the  “man-milieu  relationship”  (Sprout  and  Sprout, 
1965:  47ff) deals with  how the  environment affects the  state  and  vice versa and  ranges 
from  environmental  determinism,  a  watered  down  version  of  the  same  where  the 
environment 
they  call  “environmental 
possibilism”,  where  the  milieu  is  “simply  there”  and  like  clay  “sometimes  malleable, 
sometimes refractory...at the disposal of...the builder” (Ibid., 83), before settling with a 
complex model.  While  the  Sprouts’  complex  model  is  unsuitable  for  integrating  it  into 
the  concept of a  national  biography,  it draws  attention  to the  interplay  of how the  state 
forms  and  is  formed  by  the  space  it  is  situated  in  (see  also  Aron,  1966:  187ff).  It  is 
echoed  in  Arnold  Wolfers’  suggestion that  states  hold  “milieu  goals”  aimed  at  shaping 
conditions “beyond national  boundaries”.  With the notion of milieu goals Wolfers seeks 
to  capture  that  states  “have  reason  to  concern  themselves  with  things  other  than  their 
own  possessions”,  namely  creating  “peace  and  order”  and  making  a  difference  in 
“happiness,  in  future  opportunities,  and  perhaps  in  moral  satisfaction”  (Wolfers,  1962: 
73ff).  Said  differently,  shaping the  ‘milieu’  is  about  influencing the  development of a 
space  beyond  its  Westphalian  borders,  a  space  which  ‘the  state’  neither  owns  nor 
controls but whose constellation  it nevertheless considers of vital  importance for its well 
being.205

Although none of these authors are concerned with rethinking the ontology of the state -  
indeed  they do not question  its  composition  as  a territorial  unit -  their attempt to think 
about a symbiotic relationship with the environment goes some way towards the  idea of 
an  ‘experienced space’.  From recognizing complex interactions between the state and  its 
‘milieu’  it  is  only  a  short  step  to  conceptualise  this  relationship  as  a  process  of mutual

204  After  a  lengthy  discussion  about  the  problems  involved  with  ‘personifying  the  state’  the 
Sprouts accept that one may redefine states “in a manner compatible with psychological modes of 
speaking” (Sprout and Sprout  1965: 37).

constitution.  What  still  needs  to  be  emphasized  is  that  ‘the  state’  is  not  ontologically 
separate  from  ‘its’  surrounding  space,  that  the  two  unfold  together  and  that  in  this 
process meaning is inscribed  into both.

Thinking o f Regions:  The European Space
The  third  concept  for  thinking  differently  about  the  state’s  situatedness  in  space  is 
regionalism. In IR a focus on  ‘regions’  and on processes o f ‘regionalisation’  is generally 
understood as analyzing interaction on the level somewhere between  ‘the state’  and  ‘the 
global’.206  For  Karl  Deutsch,  a  region  is  “a  set  of countries  that  are  more  markedly 
interdependent  over a  wide  range  of different  dimensions  -  and  usually  transactions  -  
than they are with other countries.  In many ways, therefore, regions are made by culture, 
history,  politics,  and economics  rather than  by geography alone”  (cited  in  Adler  1997a: 
253).  For many scholars the  analysis of regions primarily  is  about a shift  in the  level  of 
analysis  within  an  anarchic  world.  For  instance,  Barry  Buzan  and  Ole  Waever’s 
‘Regional  Security Complexes’  are  objectively identifiable  ‘subsystems’  in  a  neorealist 
world  of  anarchy,  rooted 
territoriality  and  defined  by  (perceived)  security 
interdependence  amongst  its  entities  (states)  (Buzan  and  Waever  2003:  11,  41-49,  80- 
87).  As Buzan and Waever note, this framework does not deal  with the political  practice 
of “labelling regions”, that is,  how regional  spaces  are constructed  from the  perspective 
of ‘the  state’  and  the meaning given to them,  let alone  how the  state  sees  itself situated 
within a ‘region’  (Buzan and Waever 2003: 48).207

in 

More  fruitful  for  the  present  purpose  is  David  Lake  and  Patrick  Morgan’s  (1997) 
conception  of regions,  which  picks up  Andrew Hurrell’s  point that notions  of ‘regional 
awareness’,  ‘regional  identity’  and  ‘regional consciousness’  are central to the analysis of 
regionalism.  Hurrell  even  makes  an  explicit  connection  between  nationalism  and 
regionalism  when  noting  that  “as  with  nationalism,  there  is  a  good  deal  of historical 
rediscovery, myth-making, and invented traditions” within regions (Hurrell  1995: 41). In 
the  same  vein,  and  with  a  focus  on  the  security  realm,  Emanuel  Adler  suggests  that 
understanding  of how  people  create  security  requires  examining the  link  between  their 
images  of  reality  and  “the  places  and  regions  that  people  feel  comfortable  calling 
‘home’” (Adler  1997a:  249).  For Adler such places which are “perceived as  ‘home’  and 
‘insideness’”  are  regions,  defined  not  primarily  on  the  basis  of territory  but  values.  In 
what echoes the Sprouts’  psycho-milieu, Adler describes processes of identification with

Morgan (1997, ch.  1); Buzan and Waever (2003: 77-82); Katzenstein (2005, ch.  1).

what he calls “regional  systems of meanings” or “cognitive regions” (Ibid., 252-254).208 
Although  Adler  downplays  the  significance  of emotional  attachment,  contradicting  his 
own  emphasis  on  ‘feeling  comfortable’,  his  discussion  makes  three  important  points. 
First, and most strongly, Adler sees these regions as an extension of what Ruggie called 
“social  epistemes”,  namely  webs  of  meaning  and  signification  emerging  out  of  “the 
process  by which  a  society  first comes to  imagine  itself’  (Ruggie  1993:  157).  As  such, 
second,  he  not  only  emphasises  the  importance  of institutions  and  interactions  within 
them  as  playing  a  major  role  in  constituting  such  regions,  but  the  region  is  also 
understood  to  be  part of ‘the  state’.  This  is  linked  to,  third,  Adler’s  notes  how  regions, 
understood  as  cognitive  spaces,  serve  to  provide  a  sense  of being  at  ‘home’.  Although 
the  last  two  points  are  made  more  tentatively,  they  provide  important  conceptual 
openings when now moving to the specific phenomenon of the ‘European’  region.

The  final  clues  are  taken  from  studies  of the  ‘European’  region.  This  is  not  merely 
because the  empirical  puzzle deals with  institutions addressing  ‘European  security’  but, 
in confirmation of Hurrell’s (1995:  45) claim that the study of European  integration  has 
done most to advance the theoretical analysis of ‘regionalism’, because the phenomenon 
of  ‘Europeanisation’  comes  closest  to  capturing  the  image  of a  state  unfolding  in  an 
experienced  space.  Most  obviously,  the  process  of  European 
invites 
conceiving  of  ‘Europe’  as  a  dynamic  space  under  construction.  Attempts  to  come  to 
terms with  Ruggie’s  (1993:  140)  assessment that the  spatial  complexes  associated  with 
the  EU  “may  constitute  nothing  less  than  the  emergence  of  the  truly  postmodern 
international political form” provide fertile ground for rethinking ‘the state’  in space.

integration 

If one  looks  beyond  the  debate  between  ‘supranationalist’  and  ‘intergovemmentalist’ 
designs,  and  if one  leaves  aside  complex  attempts to  conceptualise  EUrope  as  forming 
some  sort  of  neo-medieval  system,  valuable  ontological  insights  on  how  ‘Europe’ 
features in the spatial configuration of the state emerge in the debate around a ‘European 
identity’  (Smith  1997;  Strath  2002).  When  research  on  whether  ‘Europe’  had  replaced 
the  ‘nation’  as the  primary point of identification  among the  population  of EU  member 
states produced  inconclusive results, scholars came to realise that there is no trade-off in 
the  interplay  between  national  and  European  identities.  Instead  of replacing  the  state, 
inscribed  into  the  conception  of  ‘the  state’,  suggesting  that  “the 
‘Europe’  was 
states/nations themselves have been transformed and the European  level  integrated  into 
the meaning of the state/nation” (Weaver  1998:  94; also Wallace  1997). This process has

been captured  in the literature under the notion of ‘Europeanisation’, encompassing both 
‘bottom-up’  and  ‘top-down’  movements  of  how  either  ‘state’  representatives  have 
transformed  the  ‘European’  landscape  of  governance  (most  visible  in  terms  of  law) 
through EU  institutions or how the latter have shaped the Member States’  understanding 
of themselves  as  ‘European’  (captured  on  the  individual  level  in  the  notion  of ‘going 
native  in  Brussels’).  In  contrast  to  Adler’s  notion  of  cognitive  regions  as  purely 
intersubjective  constructs,  studies  of  ‘Europeanisation’  have  demonstrated  that  the 
European  space takes on  a genuine national  outlook and, thus, that states  have different 
(subjective)  conceptions  of  ‘Europe’ 
(Marcussen  et  al.  1999;  Herzfeld  2002; 
Featherstone  and  Radaelli  2003).209  This  ‘Europeanisation’  phenomenon  comes closest 
to  offering  a  conception  of the  state  unfolding  in  a  broader  experienced  space  whose 
meaning is incorporated in the national narrative (see also Delanty and Rumford 2005).

That  said,  the  ‘Europeanisation’  perspective  has  one  weakness which  it  shares  with  the 
moderate  constructivist  narrative  discussed  earlier:  by 
implying  a  progressive 
development,  the  Westphalian  state  remains  the  starting  point  and  the  ‘European’ 
dimension is conceived of as something new, a recent phenomenon which is product of a 
socialisation  process  through  participation  in  European  integration.  Yet  from  a  deep 
theory perspective this spatial conception  is nothing  ‘new’.  While  it arguably is the case 
that the  EC (now EU) process  has advanced a certain  idea of Europe,  as Pocock (1997: 
302)  reminds  ‘Europe’  has  always  meant  different  things  to  different  people.  States 
which  are  geographically  located  on  the  European  continent  have  always  contained  a 
some  conception  of ‘Europe’  in  their  national  narrative,  a  point  made  recently  by  Ute 
Frevert’s (2005) in her call for a ‘Europeanisation’  of German history.210

Parameters of Authenticity II: Unfolding in Time
This  section  substantiates the temporal  dimension of the national  biography and,  hence, 
to  conceptualize  how  “the  good  [is]  woven  into  my  understanding  of my  life  as  an 
unfolding  story”  (Taylor  1989:  47).  Simply  put,  it  is  about  exploring  how  meaning  is 
generated  and  manifested  in  time.  In discussing how an  unfolding  Self gains a sense  of 
stability/continuity by turning ‘past’  and  ‘future’  into meaningful places, the below also 
considers  how  the  spatial  features  discussed  earlier  -   centre/soul,  valued  order  and 
value-horizons  -   feature  in  time.  By  doing  so,  the  discussion  also  weaves  in  two  of

130

Bergson’s  points,  downplayed  by  Heidegger,  namely  how  meaningful  experience 
grounds the Self emotionally and how experiences have creative potential.211

Past: M emory Spaces
The ‘experienced’  space is one which, by definition, brings out the past as a category for 
orientation.  Said the other way around,  as  an  accumulation  of experiences, the past  is  a 
reservoir for inscribing space with  meaning.  This reservoir is accessed through memory 
or,  more  precisely,  by  “memory  space”  (Assmann,  1999).  Memories  have  long  been 
recognized  as  a  force  of  orientation  central  Self-consciousness.  Indeed,  scholars  of 
memory  hold  that  a  sense  of Self is  defined  primarily,  if not  exclusively,  by  engaging 
with the past:  “an understanding of the past...tells us who we  are”  (Lebow,  2006:  3).212 
While this  claim  is  a  bit too  strong as  it  misses taking  into account the  future,  for now 
the  important  point  is  that  through  memories  or  “frames  of  remembrance”  (Irwin- 
Zarecka  1994) the Self is linked to its past. Indeed one might even say the memoiy space 
is the past the Self lives in.213 The significance of memories for the national biography is 
that  they  are  rooted  in  and  thereby  give  access  to  experience  (Koselleck,  1985).  As 
Iwona Irwin-Zarecka emphasizes,

“we have by now become so familiar with accounts of how history can be 
rewritten,  manipulated  for  political  ends,  forgotten,  or  embellished,  that 
we  may  be  at  risk  of  losing  from  view  the  experiential  bases  on 
which...memory, rests.  In the most direct terms,  as people  first articulate 
and share the sense they make of their past, it is their experience,  in all  its 
emotional  complexity,  that  serves  as  the  key  reference  point”  (Irwin- 
Zarecka,  1994:  17).

Unfolding  through  a  memory  space  requires  a  reflective  Self  as  the  process  of 
remembering involves an  evaluation -  learning and  interpretation -  of experience.  This 
process  is  intertwined with  forgetting,  indeed as Heidegger and  others  have pointed out 
that  the  latter  is  a  necessary  element  of the  former  (Heidegger  1953:  339;  Assmann 
1999:  30; Bleiker,  1997). Thus the notion of memory space does not simply add another 
layer  to  the  experienced  space  but  substantiates  the  conceptualisation  of the  latter.  It

211  Bergson’s  account  is  otherwise  less  suitable  for  three  major  reasons.  First,  rather  than 
rethinking  the  spatiality  of being,  his  critique  of the  mathematical  conception  of space  leads 
Bergson  to  reject  the  link  between  experience  and  space  (Guerlac  2006:  63-65).  Second, 
Bergson’s reading of ‘inner time’  as  a unique mental/emotional  state places too much  emphasis 
on the inward-looking individual rather than one constituted via ‘worldliness’. Third, by focusing 
on the fusion  of experiences and the moment of creation, past and future cease to be  meaningful 
analytical categories. Heidegger was highly critical of Bergson’s ontology of Self and time which 
he considered “completely unbestimmt and insufficient” (Heidegger  1953:  333). On Heidegger’s 
engagement with Bergson, see Collins-Cavanaugh (2005)
212 See also Assmann (1999); Irwin-Zarecka (1994); Fentress and Wickham (1992).
213 Historians have long ignored memory as a credible source because of its subjective bias.

131

asks  how  meaning  is  extracted  from  (or,  rather,  attributed  to)  experience  and  how  it 
becomes part of the ontological  structure of being.  More precisely,  it asks how memory 
and experience relate.

Irwin-Zarecka  (1994)  speaks  of  a  “household”  or  “infrastructure”  of memory,  where 
memory is ‘held alive’ through various media and practices. Yet to say that ‘memory’  is 
held  alive,  scholars  are  divided  over  whether  memories  should  be  regarded  as 
‘knowledge  containers’  which  store  and  recall  ‘facts’  on  demand,  or  whether  they 
should  be  seen  as  an  unsystematic  source  of sensations  (Fentress  and  Wickham  1992; 
Assmann  1999). One way out is to adopt the suggestion made by Fentress and Wickham 
(1992)  that the  question  is  not  about two  ‘kinds’  of memory  but  about  representation. 
Those memories which appear like replica of the past do  so because they are translated 
into and made accessible through language, whereas those experiences which cannot be 
articulated  remain  ‘personal’.  In  other  words,  the  matter  is  one  of  communicability: 
“what  emerges  at  the  point  of articulation  is  not the  objective  part  of memory  but  its 
social aspect” (Fentress and Wickham  1992:  7).

The  notion  of a  ‘personal’  memory echoes  Bergson’s  notion  of ‘inner time’  constituted 
by the idiosyncratic fusion of significant experiences mentioned in the previous chapter. 
While  its  exclusivity  makes  it  a  source  of authenticity,  when  applied  to  the  level  of a 
national  biography,  that  is,  when  assuming  that  memory  is  held  collectively  in  a 
‘society’ or ‘nation’, this exclusivity is compromised of course.  Distancing himself from 
Bergson,  Maurice  Halbwachs  famously  spoke  of the  existence  of  such  a  “collective 
memory”, or the “social frameworks of memory” (cadres sociaux de la memoire), as he 
originally  termed  it  (Halbwachs,  1992  [1952]).  A  national  biography  is  such  a  social 
frameworks  which  binds  a  society  through  shared  meaning  structures  generated  from 
experiences.  More  precisely,  political  agents  compete  for 
the  most  ‘adequate’ 
representation  and  seek  acceptance  for the  same  amongst those  sharing the  experience 
and  identifying  with  the  national  biography.214  To  understand  how  memory  space  can 
give rise to competing representations, it is necessary to take a closer look at the ‘nature’ 
of the experience.

214 The role of agency will  be taken up towards the end of this chapter.  The next chapter (seven) 
will  argue that this representation  occurs  in  a transnational  setting,  that  is,  involves not only the 
domestic constituency but also external partners.

The Ambiguity of Significant Experience
A memory space is created by a significant experience, vaguely defined as an experience 
which  disturbs  and  reconfigures  the  world  the  Self had  disclosed.  It  is  foundational  by 
way  of unsettling the  Selfs  understanding  of the  world  and,  hence,  its  position  in  it.  It 
leaves  a  deep  emotional  impression.  An  extreme  version  of a  significant  experience  is 
the  ‘shock’,  which  could  be  seen  as  similar to  that  Heideggerian  moment  in  which  the 
Self is pulled  back from the everyday and able to grasp the authenticity of its  existence. 
The  difference  is  that  while  Heidegger  fixes  that  moment  as  one  in  which  the  Self 
‘faces’  its  own  death,  the  shock  as  a  significant  experience  constitutes  a  source  for 
authentic becoming by turning the past into a source for meaning through which the Self 
understands its being-in-the-world.

While a significant experience is not necessarily negative, they often are. Amongst them, 
war  can  be  seen  as  forming  a  crucial  if  not  the  most  important  memory  space  in  a 
national  biography.  The  experience  of violence,  suffering  and  loss  it  entails  leaves  a 
deep  impression  amongst all  involved.  As  one  scholar  notes,  “no  single  act  of politics 
interferes  so  radically  and  so  profoundly  in  the  lives  of people...as  war”  (Krippendorf 
quoted  in  Rast  2006:  16).  Although  the  degree  of interference  varies  in  a  society,  war 
affects and  leaves deep traces  in  society and  shapes those cadres sociaux de la memoire 
(Rast 2006).  Psychoanalysts  have discussed  the  impact of war  in  shaping the  biography 
of those  experiencing  it and  historians  have  discussed  its  effect  on  nationalism  and  the 
‘making’  of states.  Indeed, the central place of war in the memory of ‘states’  as reflexive 
beings  is  central  to  IR  since  its  inception.  As  discussed  in  chapter  three,  realist 
theorizing  fundamentally  builds  on  the  argument that the  experience  of war  conditions 
how states (should) orientate themselves in space and time.

A  significant  experience  such  as  war  cannot  be  reproduced  but  only  represented,  and 
even  this  is  difficult  as  pointed  out  by  scholars  investigating  the  phenomenon  of 
‘trauma’.215  Introduced by  Freud  used  to  replace  the  term  ‘shock’,  the  ‘trauma’  was  to 
describe  the  psychological  effects  witnessed  among  soldiers  in  the  First  World  War 
unable  to  explain  what  happened  ‘out  there’,  witnessed  also  among  survivors  of other 
‘unimaginable’  experiences  such  as  concentration  camps 
in  Nazi  Germany,  the 
detonation of atomic bombs in Japan, or the American defeat in Vietnam (Edkins 2003). 
Phenomenologically, what makes (war understood as) trauma significant is that it cannot 
be  ‘unmade’  or  forgotten.  The  Self  has  to  live  with  it,  quite  literally,  in  what  Saul

Friedlander  has  termed  “deep  memory”  (see  Young  2003),  inscribed  in  the  very 
definition  of a  trauma  as  an  “event  that  leaves  indelible  marks  upon...consciousness,

in  fundamental  and 
irrevocable ways” (Alexander 2004:  I).216

taxonomy  used  here, 

In  contrast  to  the  notion  of  a  ‘critical  juncture’  employed  by  institutionalists,  a 
significant  experience  (shock/trauma)  does  not  lay  out  a  clear  path  on  which  the  Self 
moves  forward.  Hence,  against the  view  put forward  by  realists,  the  experience  of war 
does  not  necessarily  generate  distrust  and  pessimism.  By  intervening  in  the  Selfs 
understanding/knowledge of the  world,  it not  only  magnifies  the  feeling  of anxiety  but 
also  opens  up  the view  for possibilities  of being which  the  Self had  not  been  aware  of 
previously  (see  below).  In  the 
the  significant  experience 
necessarily alters the configuration of the centre/soul and the drawing of value-horizons. 
In  that  sense,  it  does  marks  a  ‘turning  point’  in  the  biography  of the  Self  by  both 
‘breaking’  ground  and  providing  necessary  opportunities  for  ‘(re)making’  ground.  Yet 
because  the  meaning  of  a  shock/trauma  cannot  be  exhausted,  it  is  not  historically 
deterministic  but  a  source  of  creativity,  as  noted  by  scholars  like  Bergson,  Walter 
Benjamin,  or  Hannah  Arendt.  As  noted  in  the  last  chapter,  Bergson  particularly 
emphasised  the  creative  process  coming  out  of  the  fusion  of  experiences,  which 
transforms  the  memory  space  and  poses  a  permanent  necessity  and  opportunity  to,  as 
Arendt put  it,  “think experience”  and  use  this thinking as  a guide  for activity (Althaus, 

2001).

Significant experiences thus become a source of energy through which moral  lessons are 
derived.  They  leave  places  in  the  past  marked  through  not  much  more  than  names  -  
Verdun, Auschwitz,  Hiroshima,  Vietnam -  which  ‘stand  for’  something. And  when this 
something  (linguists  would  say  the  ‘signifier’)  is  filled  with  meaning  they  become  a 
space  for  creativity.217  Thus,  ‘making  sense’  of significant  experiences  associated  with 
these places implies that the  lessons derived from them are made.  Because  lessons are a 
creation  of the  Self  and  not  intrinsic  to  the  experience,  it  comes  to  no  surprise  that 
scholars examining the use of ‘history’  among foreign policy makers find that analogies

216  A  war  experience  does  not  need  to  be  exclusively  traumatic  and  may  be  offset  by  the 
experience of victory. The emotional experience of ‘winning’ has a significant effect on how the 
Self  sees  its  place  in  the  world,  as  the  phenomenon  of  ‘triumphalism’  visible  in  post-1990 
American foreign policy testifies.

individuals.

prediction.218

Future: Envisioned Spaces
For  ‘thinking  experience’  the  past  is  not  enough.  Memory  spaces  cannot  sufficiently 
center the  Self, that  is,  control  its  anxiety  and  satisfy  the  desire  for  stability/continuity, 
for  two  reasons:  first,  as  noted  above,  significant  experiences  will  always  remain  a 
source  of ambiguity,  and  the  lessons  ‘learned’  from  them  are  never  definite.  Second, 
while the  ‘grounding’  in  memory provides a centre of gravity in the  past,  even a strong 
‘sense of history’  cannot tame anxiety simply because it does not address the uncertainty 
of  the  future.  Hence,  what  is  missing  from  the  biography  of  the  Self  is  how  the 
‘historicity’  of being is linked to the future. More precisely, it is necessary to connect the 
‘historical  being’  with  the  ‘future  being’  by  thinking  about  how  the  future  becomes  a 
meaningful place which can be, if not ever ‘known’, at least imagined.

The  importance  of the  category of the  future  is  apparent  in  the  fact that  unfolding  is  a 
forward-movement.  Indeed,  in  Heidegger’s  understanding  of the  ‘structural  whole’  of 
being-in-the-world,  being  as  becoming  is  fundamentally  future  oriented.  The  unknown 
future  is  the  source  of anxiety  and  is  responsible  for  the  fact  that  ‘being’  is  always 
incomplete,  something  not-yet.  And  because  the  mood  of anxiety  is  directed  into  or, 
rather,  comes  out  of the  future,  the  orientation  towards  and  its  desire  to  ‘understand’ 
(give meaning to) the future is the most significant element of ‘being’  (Heidegger  1953: 
§65, 327ff.).

As  noted  in  the  last  chapter,  for  Heidegger  authenticity  emerges  out  of understanding 
ones “ownmost [or:  innermost]  possibilities” (Heidegger  1953:  §31,  §68a).  As a future- 
oriented  being, the  Self is constituted through  its understanding of that it can-be.  Being, 
Heidegger  writes  is  not  a  present  thing  [ein  Vorhandenes]  but  is  “primarily  possible- 
being  [Moglichsein].  Being  is  always  that  which  it  can  be  and  how  it  is  its  possibility 
[wie  es seine Moglichkeit «/]”.  This  possibility is  not an  “empty,  logical  possibility”  as 
contained  in contingency, where one  is randomly expecting that this or that may happen 
(Ibid.,  143).  Rather than  being  a  free-floating  possibility,  the  possible-being  Heidegger 
speaks  about  is  that  being  which  has  understood  that  it  could  become  one  way  or 
another.  The  understanding of this  possibility  of being takes  the  form  of what  he  calls 
Entwurf which might be translated as design, which delineates “the room of manoeuvre

218 May (1973); May and Neustadt (1986); Jervis (1976); Khong (1992); Levy (1994).

135

[Spielraum]”  of what  the  Self actually  can  become.  Yet  as  Heidegger  points  out  the 
Entwurf is  not a carefully thought-through plan which the  Self follows  but,  rather,  is an 
understanding  the  possibilities  of being,  of what  it  can  become,  as  possibilities  (Ibid., 
145).  The  designing  [entwerfende]  Self is  envisioning the  places  it can  unfold  towards, 
projects them  into the future and draws its horizon of expectations around them. And by 
understanding  its  possibilities,  by  seeing  these  places,  the  Self always  already  is  these 
possibilities  and,  to that extent,  already  is  in  these  places.  As  Heidegger writes,  “Only 
because  [the Self]  is constituted through understanding and  its design-character, because 
it  is  what  it  becomes  [bzw]  does  not  become,  can  it...say  to  itself:  ‘become  what you 
are!’” (Ibid.,  145).  In Malpas’ words, being is “always ‘on the way’...but that which  it is 
on the way toward is the place in which it already begins” (Malpas 2006:  17).

is  a  key  feature  of  authentic 
Understanding  ones  ‘ownmost’  possibilities,  then, 
becoming. Heidegger calls this vorlaufen, which literally means  ‘running forward/ahead’ 
but  may  be  better  translated  as  advancing  into  or  anticipating,  basically  capturing  the 
formulation of an authentic future (Heidegger  1953: 336). He juxtaposes the vorlaufende 
Self  with  the  Self  on  the  path  of  Verfallen,  where  the  S elfs  understanding  of  its 
possibilities  is  blurred  because  by  getting  lost  in  the  everyday  the  Self looses  sight  of 
what it could be.  It does not recognise that only death  limits the possibilities available to 
being  and  thus  also  does  not  recognise  the  future  as  its  place.  Such  a  future  is 
inauthentic.  Hence,  in  the  process  of  Verfallen  the  Self  does  not  really  grasp  the 
potential  of  ‘being  towards’,  of projecting  meaning  into  the  world  of the  ‘not  yet’,  it 
lacks full awareness of the ‘not yet’  as a source of hope, promise, and possibilities. Even 
if the theoretical  narrative developed here does not adopt Heidegger’s point that only  in 
facing  ones  own  death  the  ‘moment  of  vision’  emerges  in  which  grasping  authentic 
being  is  possible,  it  does  adopt  the  view  that  the  ability  to  delineate  a  distinctive 
meaningful  future,  which  one  is  able  to  ‘claim’  and  move  towards,  is  necessary  for 
authentic becoming.

Recognizing the possibilities of the future  implies  not only that the  future  is understood 
to be  ‘open’  (although not open-ended),  it also makes the future a space which provides 
its  own  source  of energy.  Whereas the memory space  and  the  significant experiences  it 
contains is an  inexhaustible source of meaning, as noted earlier, the energy of the future 
is found in  its  ‘pull factor’, that is, of providing the Self with an opportunity to  ‘rethink’ 
experience the past and move on, or ahead, on a certain  ‘course’.  It lends unfolding what 
Heidegger calls Entschlossenheit, namely the resolve to realize a vision which, by doing 
so,  it is becoming. Conceptualising authentic becoming -  the formulation of an authentic

136

biographical  narrative -  as the ability of understanding ones future possibilities is not to 
argue that visions of future places are designed out of thin air, or that they are sterile and 
fixed.  Rather,  in correspondence with the above discussion, they are created through the 
memory  space  formed  by  significant  experiences  in  a  process  of creative  projection. 
This conceptualisation of the connection between past and future will  be arrived at via a 
discussion of utopias/visions.219

Utopia as the Place to Be220
Enabling the  Self to  unfold  into a meaningful future,  utopias are a  central  element of a 
coherent  biographical  narrative.  In  a  way,  utopias  or  visions  of  the  ‘good’  order 
projected  into  the  future  provide  the  complementary anxiety  controlling  mechanism  to 
the  memory  space  created  by  significant  experiences.  A  utopia  transforms  the 
‘surrounding’  space the Self has disclosed into one in which the Self situates itself in the 
future and turns the same into a meaningful  place.  It delineates an  envisioned space and 
corresponding  “horizons  of expectations”  (Koselleck  1985)  which  the  Self sees  itself 
unfolding into/moving towards and in the possibility of which  it believes. By delineating 
this  place to  be,  utopias provide the  direction  for unfolding  and,  as  such,  are  confirmed 
through  practices.  As such, the vision toward which  political  leaders direct the narrative 
of ‘the state’  also directs their policies and, in that sense, means and ends merge.

Unfortunately,  while  IR  scholars  accept  that  decision  makers  may  be  guided  by 
‘worldviews’,  utopias  carry  an  analytical  stigma  in  the  discipline  and  do  not  receive 
much  analytical  attention.  Paradoxically, 
this  stigmatisation  was  advocated  and 
continues  to  be  upheld  by  those  scholars  who  first  recognised  its  importance,  namely 
realists.  The  insight  that  utopias  matter  has  been  central  to  IR  scholarship  since  Carr 
noted  that  “utopianism  penetrates  the  citadel  of  realism”  (Carr  2001:  85).  Realism 
emerged  as  a  normative-analytical  corrective  intended  to  warn  policymakers  ‘blinded’ 
by  the  wrong  ideas  of how  the  world  works,  and  so  giving  analytical  importance  to 
utopias  other  than  those  advocated  by  realist  worst-case  scenarios  was  discouraged.221 
Although  scholars  have  rehabilitated  ideas  and  acknowledge  that  they  may  serve  as 
“road  maps”  and  “focal  points”  defining  “the  universe  of  possibilities”  in  the  future 
(Goldstein  and  Keohane  1993:  8),  with  Wendt  at  one  point  suggesting  that  state

219  I  am  using  ’visions’  when  referring  to  ideas  of  order  projected  into  the  future  because 
‘utopias’  and ‘ideologies’ are too laden with meaning in the general understanding.
220 In that sense, the place attributed to utopias here contradicts the original meaning of the term, 
a fusion of the Greek words ‘ou’  (not) and ‘topos’ (place), hence literally ‘no-place’.
221  The  stigma also  has  lead some politicians to deny that they are guided by visions,  as  former 
German  chancellor  Helmut  Schmidt  once  remarked  “the  one  who  has  visions  should  go  see  a 
doctor” (cited in Der Spiegel, 44/2002, p. 26).

behaviour  is  guided  by  “self-fulfilling  prophecies”  (Wendt  1999:  184ff.),  the  realist 
critique has left its mark and makes a closer look at them necessary.

Utopias  have  always  played  a central  role  in  social  life.  While  the  term  is  said  to  have 
entered the world with the publication of Thomas More’s book of the same title  in  1516, 
this  publication  can  be  placed  in  the  line  with  political  writings  envisioning  order 
initiated by Plato (Logan and Adams,  1989).  Formulations of utopias can be found  in all 
philosophies  promising  progress  in  human  affairs,  whether  Kant’s  idea  of a  perpetual 
peace,  Hobbes’  formulation  of the  Leviathan,  or  Marx’  promise  of a  classless  society 
(Ruesen et al.  2005;  Hutchings 2008). Karl Mannheim describes utopias as “methods of 
thought by means of which we  arrive at  our most crucial  decisions,  and through which 
we  seek  to  diagnose  and  guide  our  political  and  social  destiny”  (Mannheim  1936:  If) 
and Tower Sargent claims that “utopian thinking it essential for our social, political, and 
psychological  health”,  quoting  Oscar  Wilde  saying that  “a  map  of the  world  that  does 
not include utopia is not worth even glancing at” (Tower Sargent 2005: 4).

While  for  some  utopia  is  “the  best  of all  possible  worlds”  (Nozick,  1974:  298),  the 
present  conception  is  more  modest,  It  does  not  understand  utopia  as  a  promise  of 
paradise but merely as a vision  of a better world.  This follows  Lyman Tower  Sargent’s 
(2005)  point  that  envisioning  the  ‘good  life’  does  not  necessarily  mean  envisioning  a 
perfect  world.  Indeed,  one  can  go  all  the  way  back  to  More’s  character,  who  sees  a 
society  which  he  considers  preferable  to  the  one  he  lives  but  not  one  without  flaws 
(Moore  1989  [1516]:  109-111).  At  the  same  time,  visions  of  the  future  may  also 
encompass  a  dystopia,  that  is,  they  may  include  pictures  not  only  of  ‘better  worlds’ 
(characterized  by  the  good/desirable  order)  but  also  of undesirable  ones  (characterized 
by  the  bad/undesirable  order).  Dystopian  visions  are  also  projected  into  the  familiar 
space  and  paint  the  picture  of an  unpleasant  future.  To  be  envisioned,  they  must  be 
considered just as  ‘possible’  as a utopia,  and their purpose  is to call  for certain activities 
for  averting  the  dystopia.  As  such,  dystopias  are  used  to  envision  and  order  the  Self 
could  become  if it  does  not  sufficiently  invest  into  the  path  given  by  the  utopia.  In 
manifesting  an  image  of a  ‘worse  world’,  dystopias  further  strengthen  the  future  as  a 
meaningful  place  by  reinforcing the contours  of the  ‘better world’  through  an  image  of 
the  alternative  unfolding.  However,  while  a  utopia  is  likely to  be  strengthened  through 
the parallel formulation of a credible dystopia -  a prominent pairing being that of heaven 
and hell -  it is not assumed here that a utopia is necessarily accompanied by a dystopia.

138

An  important question  is  when  visions  of the  future,  whether utopias  or dystopias,  are 
considered  possible  (credible/believable).  This  brings  in  the  realist  critique  of utopias. 
Perhaps  most famous  is  Marx’  critique of ideology  and  his complaint that religion  was 
creating  happiness  through  an  illusion.222  Yet  Marx’  critique  of ideologies  is  not  only 
evidence  that  he  was  well  aware  of their  influence  in  shaping  human  consciousness 
(which  for  him  was  ‘false’  until  it  recognized the  material  conditions  as  he  saw them), 
the  fact  that  he  still  devised  his  own  utopia  of a  class-less  society  is  testimony  to  the 
ambivalence the role of visions have in ‘materialist’  (or realist) writings.

One prominent example is Karl  Mannheim’s work.  For Mannheim, who was  influenced 
by  Marx,  ‘ideologies’  and  ‘utopias’  are  psychological  phenomena  transcending  the 
historically  formed order or,  in  his  words,  ‘reality’  (Mannheim  1936:  193).  The  central 
feature  distinguishing  ‘ideologies’  and  ‘utopias’  is the  static  (or conservative) character 
of the  former  and  the  progressive  (or  revolutionary)  character  of the  latter (Mannheim 
1936:  40).  More  precisely,  for  Mannheim  ‘ideology’  is  not  only  a  self-deceptive 
understanding  of the  world  but  a  state  of mind  whose  strong  value-orientation  makes 
people  unaware  of the  dynamic  of ‘reality’,  an  artificial  stabilizer  rendering  its  bearer 
prone  to  misperceptions  and,  therefore,  functions  as  a  source  of  error.  By  contrast, 
utopias  are  states  of mind  “oriented  towards  objects  which  do  not  exist  in  the  actual 
situation” (Ibid,  192) and aimed at transformation. They are ‘wish-images’  giving rise to 
practice  challenging  and  breaking  with  “the  order  of  things  prevailing  at  the  time”, 
which  makes  them  revolutionary  in  character  and  different  from  ‘ideologies’  which 
Mannheim  sees  as  more  conservative.223  Yet  while  Mannheim  gives  a  negative 
connotation  to  both,  he  tries  to  reconcile  the  tension  in  Marx’  by  mentioning  forward- 
looking  ideas  that  are  ‘appropriate’  in  the  sense  that they  neither  ignore  nor  challenge 
the existing order but remain “’organically’  and harmoniously integrated  into the world­
view  characteristic  of  the  period”  (Ibid,  193).  In  other  words,  here  the  vision  is 
‘transcending’  by  going  beyond  but  not  breaking  with  what  ‘is’  or,  rather,  if reality  is 
understood as a historically condition order, what ‘was’.

Carr,  the  most  prominent  IR  scholar  discussing  utopias,  was  influenced  by  both  Marx 
and  Mannheim  (Cox,  2001:  xix)  and  also  struggles  with  both  criticizing  utopias  and 
acknowledging their  importance.  He  approvingly  quotes  Reinhold  Niebuhr  saying that

222 In his Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right Marx called religion “the opium of the people”. 
Marx/Engels’ critique o f‘The German Ideology’ was influential in casting ideology as deceptive.
223  „Not  until  certain  social  groups  embodied these  wish-images  into  their  actual  conduct,  and 
tried to realize them, did these ideologies become utopian" (Mannheim,  1936:  193)

139

“the  truest  visions  of  religions  are  illusions,  which  may  be  partly  realized  by  being 
resolutely  believed”  (in  Carr,  2001  [1946]:  85).  He  balances  his  attack  on  the  specific 
belief of a  ‘harmony of interest’  with  noting  that  political  thinking  always  contains  an 
element of utopia because aspirations are an  inevitable, even necessary part of (political) 
life. Indeed, for Carr ‘utopia’  and  ‘reality’ -  the conditions given by history -  are related 
in  a dialectic  movement in which  ideals  (utopias) become embedded  in  institutions  and 
over  time  turn  into  ‘reality’.  In  this  process  of  ‘materialization’  the  ideal  looses  its 
utopian character and is eventually challenged by a new ideal (utopia). Carr’s critique of 
‘idealism’  thus  is  compromised  by  recognizing that  ‘pure  realism’  can  offer  nothing  in 
satisfying human aspirations; once a utopia is demolished, he concedes, “we still need to 
build  a new  utopia (...) The  human will  continue to  seek  an  escape...in  the vision  of an 
international  order”  (Carr  2001  (1946):  87).  It  is  not  difficult  to  see  why  Carr’s 
analytical  frame  has  been  labelled  “utopian  realism”  (Booth  1991)  and  “peculiar 
realism” (Wilson 2001).

Even  realist  scholars  accept  the  human  need  for  utopias  as  an  anxiety  controlling 
mechanism,  indeed  by  producing their worst-case  scenarios they  are  in  the  business  of 
producing  their  own.  More  generally,  realists  share  Marx’  basic  point  that  utopias  are 
dangerous  if  divorced  from  certain  historically  grown  structures.224  Thus,  Mannheim 
calls for an  ‘appropriate’  utopia and others stress  ‘relative’,  ‘limited’ or ‘robust’  utopias, 
that  is,  visions  which  build  their transformative  agenda  into/onto  the  existing  order  of 
things  rather  than  against  it  (Alexander  2001;  Tower  Sargent  2005).  In  addition  to  the 
from  an  ethical  standpoint  crucial  warning  against  totalizing  utopias,225  what  societies 
consider an  ‘appropriate’  utopia in the sense of it fitting in the national  biography points 
to the  fact that visions  of order are  not invented  in  a vacuum.  As  noted  earlier,  for  it to 
work  as  a meaningful  reference,  a vision  must be  considered  possible  and  must have  a 
reference somewhere, which  means that place  in the future cannot be radically  ‘new’.226 
In other words, the purpose of utopias is not to confirm the contingency of the future but

224  For  a  recent  argument  along  similar  lines,  see  Lawson  (2008).  Although  Mannheim  also 
acknowledges that judgment is relative by noting that the label  ‘utopia’ tends to be used by those 
who  believe  someone  else’s  plans  to  be  unrealizable,  whereas  for those  following  it  a  ‘utopia’ 
may well mean the reality of tomorrow (Mannheim  1936:  196, 203).
225  The  problem  being,  of course,  that what  may  appears  as  a  ‘better world’  containing a  ‘good 
order’  utopia  for  some  may  be  an  undesirable  order  for  others.  Utopias  which  are  clashing  or 
irreconcilable  with,  or  even  ignore  the  lives  of,  others  may  produce  trajectories  the  pursuit  of 
which  lead  to  oppression  and  violence.  Unfortunately,  there  are  many  examples  of  national 
biographies adopting such totalizing utopias, the one propagated by Nazi Germany being just the 
most tragic example.  For a critique of flawless and  ‘pure’  ideas of order, see Baumann (1991:  10; 
1997: Ch.  1).
226  The  emphasis  on  the  creative  ability  of the  human  to  imagine  the  future  disconnected  from 
what ‘exists’  is prominent among feminist scholars, see Grosz (2005).

to turn  it into a domain of envisioned possibilities which,  in one way or another, must be 
known  to  be  imagined  (Koselleck  1985).  Hence,  envisioning  the  future  must  go 
‘through’  the  past,  through  the  experienced  space  in  a  narrative.227  Just  as  in  More’s 
novel -  his character discovers an island similar to the size of England -  utopias are not 
completely  invented  but  inscribed  into a familiar space.  They build  upon  and transform 
the ‘experienced space’.

To  be  sure,  this  construction  of  expectations/visions/utopias  out  of  experience  does 
mean  envisioning  the  future  as  a  return  of past  as  the  realist  cyclical  view  of history 
would  have  it.  As  noted  earlier,  significant  experiences  do  not  issue  clear  guidelines, 
they  are  ambiguous  and  indeterminate.  The  meaning  given  to  an  experience  and  the 
inscription  of value  into  an  experience  occurs  through  the  formulation  of the  lesson 
taken  from  it.  And  because these  lessons  are  used  as  future  guidelines,  their generation 
occurs with an eye to the future.  In other words, exactly what is remembered and exactly 
which  lessons  are  extracted  from  the  memory  space  emerges  only  in  the  process  of 
sorting  future  possibilities  of being.  They  only  emerge  by  being  linked  to  a  design  for 
the future,  by being embedded in a vision of what being-in-the-world  can (should)  look 
like.  It is only through that vision that the experienced space becomes a project in which 
the Self is constituted as a temporal whole.228

Agency in the Biographical Narrative
This  project  is  the  formulation  of  an  authentic  national  biography.  Pursuing  a 
meaningful  vision  through  the  memory  space  connects  past  and  future  to  a  coherent 
narrative  and  controls  anxiety.  More  precisely,  where  horizons  of  experience  and 
expectation  are fused,  where the experiences  space  merges with  a meaningful  vision  of 
its future composition, where the  ‘lessons’  can be used to give life to a ‘project’ -  this  is 
where the  biographical  narrative  feels  authentic  and  the  Self feels  at  ‘home’.  In  such  a 
narrative,  the  design  of the  envisioned  space  resonates  with  the  soul,  as  captured  by 
Gaston  Bachelard  when  he speaks of space gaining significance through a poetic  image 
(Bachelard,  1969/1994).  Just  like  a  poem,  a  meaningful  utopia  makes  a  connection 
which Bachelard describes as “a veritable awakening”, the possibility of the onset of an 
image  which  takes  emotional  root  in  the  soul.  Just  like  a  poem,  the  project  and  the

227 As Koselleck points out, this connection between past and future used to be understood among 
historians when Geschichte was more a narrative which “did not primarily mean the past, as it did 
later;  rather it  indicated that covert connection  of the bygone with the future whose relationship 
can only be perceived when  one has learned to construct history from modalities of memory and 
hope”  (Koselleck  1985:  270).  On  narrative,  see  also  Carr  (1986);  Ringmar  (1996);  Campbell 
(1998).

design  of the  future  being-in-the-world  it  contains  is  simple,  “the  property  of a  nai've 
consciousness...in  its  expression  it  is  youthful  language”  (Bachelard,  1994:  xix).  It  is 
necessarily naive because otherwise it could  not be creative; and  it is necessarily simple 
because it needs to evolve. This project constructed in the interstices of past and future is 
both  intimate  and  sufficiently  vague  to  accommodate  changing  interpretations  and 
allowing the project’s endurance.

Generating  and  sustaining  a  biographical  narrative  thus  is  more  than  an  act  of 
transmitting  signals,  of putting  together  some  lose  ends.  It  is,  rather,  an  existential  of 
being  which  requires  not  administrative  but  creative  capacity,  that  is,  agency.  Agency 
here  appears  similar  to  what  Emirbayer  and  Mische  (1998:  970)  have  described  as  a 
temporally embedded  process where decisions are  informed (1)  by the  past,  stimulating 
an element of iteration based on past patterns of thought and action (here:  ‘learning’), (2) 
by  the  future,  stimulating  an  element  of projection  based  on  the  capacity  to  imagine 
alternative  possibilities,  and  (3)  by  the  present,  stimulating  an  element  of  practical 
evaluation.  In  its reflexive capacity to  synthesize  spatio-temporal  orientations this  way, 
the  Self becomes an  agent in the form  of what might be called  a “relational  pragmatic” 
(Emirbayer  and  Mische  1998).  As  this  interpretative  act  is  open  to  debate  and 
contestation,  it  is  political.  Scholars  have  captured  this  under  the  notion  of  ‘identity 
politics’,  which  mostly  focuses  on  the  ‘politics  of  history’,  with  the  ‘politics  of  the 
future’  receiving far less attention.229

The  formulation  of a national  biography  is  a contested  terrain  in  which  political  actors 
compete  for  voice  and  authority.  While  every  society  contains  a  variety  of  agents 
engaged to greater or lesser degree  in the formulation  and  maintenance  of a meaningful 
biographical  narrative  -   ranging  from  teachers,  via  artists  and  intellectuals  to  editors, 
curators  and  bureaucrats  -   in  this  thesis  authority  is  assumed  to  lie  primarily  with 
political  leaders.  More precisely,  it focuses on personalities which obtain the authority to 
formulate  and  represent  the  narrative  by  virtue  of their  position  as  formally  accepted 
(elected)  heads  of  state.  How  this  position  of  authority  is  reached  varies  with  each 
society.  Weber’s  (1976:  28)  famous discussion  on  authority,  derived  from  the  belief in 
the  legitimacy of a certain person, or body, to formulate and uphold order, distinguishes 
between  authority  based  on  cost-benefit  calculation,  custom,  or  personal  affection 
amongst  those  accepting  the  order.  Said  differently,  Weber  suggests  legitimacy  is 
granted through either a  legal arrangement, a belief in tradition, or the leader’s charisma

democratic  political  systems  put  in  place  mechanisms  which  ensure  that  the  leader 
(knows  he/she)  is  held  accountable  for  the  formulation  and  maintenance  of  the 
narrative.230

CHAPTER SIX:  INTERSTATE RELATIONS AS FRIENDSHIP

Sum m ary
The  previous  chapter  conceptualized  the  state  as  a  national  biography  and  outlined  its 
spatio-temporal  parameters.  It  was  argued  that  the  state,  maintained  by  a  community 
sharing  a  sense  of  ‘Self,  controls  anxiety  and  stabilizes  its  being-in-the-world  world 
through a coherent narrative where meaning is inscribed in an experienced space ordered 
and bound by value horizons and projected into an envisioned space. The formulation of 
an  authentic  national  biography  through  the  merger  of memories  and  visions,  thereby 
connecting horizons of experience and of expectations, was said to be a creative project 
pursued  by  political  leaders.  This  chapter  discusses  the  social  or  intersubjective 
dimension of this narrative and suggests that it is formulated with significant Others, that 
is, in the context of a particular or ‘intimate’ relationship defined as friendship.

The  insertion  of the  friend  into the  causal  narrative occurs  in  five  steps:  first,  it will  be 
shown  that  Heidegger’s  logic  is  unsuitable  for  reading  authenticity  into  a  social 
dimension  (and  criticises attempts doing so).  Second,  the  chapter argues that friendship 
has  been  underconceptualized  in  IR  and  that  existing  accounts  focusing  on  ‘group 
membership’  are  unsuitable  for  accommodating  desires  of  authenticity.  Third,  the 
ontology of unfolding through  friendship will  be  substantiated  by drawing on  Aristotle, 
discussing equality and a unique logic of reciprocity as key aspects of friendship. Fourth, 
the friendship ontology will be adapted  into a reading of ‘interstate’  relations bonded by 
overlapping national  biographies to  argue that creating such  bonds  in  a particular space 
enables  ‘states’  to  gain  social  stability  (satisfying  desires  for  belonging/recognition)  as 
well  as maintaining a sense of authenticity.  Finally,  discussing the empowerment effect 
of friendship through investment in a shared project, the chapter concludes with arguing 
that international institutions serve as platforms through which this project is negotiated.

The Limits of Heidegger’s Social Ontology

So far, the conception of ‘states’  as striving for an authentic national  biography might be 
seen  as  creating what Charles  Taylor  calls  a  “culture  of narcissism”  (Taylor  1994:  55), 
as  supporting  an  individualistic,  anti-social  and  potentially  conflictual  reading  of 
interstate  relations  due to clashing narratives of meanings and values.  Such  a reading  is 
premature,  however,  because  it  is  based  on  an  incomplete  ontology  and  an  incomplete 
causal  narrative.  While  the  previous  chapter  described  the  process  of  authentic 
becoming, of unfolding in space and time, as a creative process merging past and future,

144

little  was  said  about  the  place  of  ‘Others’  in  this  process.  Yet  if cooperation  is  to  be 
explained  on the basis of a common  interest emerging out of and  supporting  individual 
(national)  interests,  defined  as  the  creation  and  maintenance  of a  coherent  biographical 
narrative,  then  the  role  of  the  ‘Other’  in  this  process  needs  to  be  looked  at  more 
carefully.

A Hobbesian account of the human condition rests on the basic acknowledgment that the 
Self  is  not  alone  in  the  world.  And  as  hinted  at  already  in  the  previous  chapter, 
Heidegger  also  is  well  aware  that  disclosure  of being-in-the-world  inevitably  involves 
relating to other beings and these others play a central role in the individual’s attempt to 
tame  anxiety.  As  Charles  Guignon  reminds  us,  contrary  to  the  view  of existentialist 
philosophy  as  emphasising  being  as  self-centred  and  inward-looking,  Heidegger’s 
fundamental  ontology  is not one of ‘rugged  individualism’  (Guignon  1993,  2006).  This 
view  is  advanced,  in  particular,  by  feminist  interpreters  of Heidegger,  who  pick  up  his 
point  that  ‘being  in’  is  always  also  ‘being  with’.  They  have  come  to  devise  a  social 
ontology of the  Self by reading Heidegger’s statement that “being with”  [Mitsein]  is  an 
“existential  characteristic  of  Dasein”  (Heidegger,  1953:  120)  as  an 
invitation  to 
conceptualise  the  authentic  Self  as  one  which  recognises 
its  being  as  one  of 
‘coexistence’ (Chanter 2001:  88ff; Odysseos 2002b, 2007).

Most recently, this is the approach taken by Louiza Odysseos, one of the few IR scholars 
engaging  Heidegger.  She  focuses  on  Heidegger’s  discussion  of the  Self disclosing  the 
world  as  a  process  in  which  it  becomes  embedded  “in  a  world  always  already 
constructed by otherness, and one that is not of Dasein’s sole making” (Odysseos 2002b: 
397). This leads her to suggest that not only does Heidegger provide an account in which 
the  Self inevitably  coexists  with  the  Other,  even  more  so  for  Odysseos  it  reads  as  if 
“Dasein  seeks the  safety  of companionship with  the  other”  because  “the  other delivers 
(the  Self)  from  anxiety”  (2002b:  390).  While  Odysseos  recognises  Heidegger’s 
argument  that  being  lost  in  the  Man  is  a  state  of /'//authenticity,  she  argues  that  it  is 
primarily  so  because  being  ‘lost’  means 
‘radical 
embeddedness’.  Said  differently,  for  her  an  inauthentic  Self  is  one  which  does  not 
recognise that  it  is  ‘permeated through  and  through  by otherness’  (Odysseos 2007:  58). 
For her,  authentic  being  is thus the process of “traversing toward  a proper  intelligibility 
of  itself  as  a  heteronomously  constituted  and  fundamentally  coexistential  being...a 
recovery of its dispersed being as a ‘se lf” (Ibid., 96f.).

In my  view this postmodern  reading of Heidegger’s notion  of ‘being with’,  specifically 
Odysseos’  conceptualisation  of  the  “other-determined  constitution  of  the  Self’ 
(Osysseos  2002b:  397)  is  problematic.  To  begin  with,  at  the  centre  of  Heidegger’s 
ontology  is  not  ‘the  Other’  but  ‘the  world’  which,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  two 
chapters,  must  be  seen  first  and  foremost  as  a  spatial-temporal  experience.231  Most 
importantly, an  interpretation  building on Heideggerian  insights must offer an answer to 
what  has  been  called  the  anxiety  dilemma  (see  chapter  four),  namely  to  reconcile  the 
desire  for  ‘stability’  (continuity/simultaneity)  with  the  desire  for  authenticity,  while 
conceptualising the  latter as a distinctive conception of unfolding in space and time. The 
problem with Odysseos’  reading of authenticity as a ‘dispersed  being’  is not only that is 
stands  in  tension  with  Charles Taylor’s  notion  of authenticity  as  something original,  as 
being  ‘true to m yself  (see chapter four),  but that it stands in tension with both accounts 
o f ‘social’  relations found in Heidegger.

The  first  account,  which  for  Heidegger  captures  the  dominant  state  of  being-in-the- 
world,  is  being as  getting  lost  in the Man.  As  outlined  in  chapter four,  in this  state the 
Self is thoroughly enmeshed  in  the  ‘social’  world,  yet this  world  is  one  without deeper 
meaning;  in  this world  being with  and  through  ‘Others’  in the  role of the Man puts the 
Self in  a  groundless  floatation  and  renders  ‘becoming’  a  process  of  Verfallen.  It  is  an 
evasion/flight  of the  possibility  of authentic  being,  which  appears  only  when  the  Self 
‘pulls  back’  from  the  Man  and  faces  its  own  death.  In  short,  Heidegger’s  discussion  of 
the  social  dimension  in  terms of the Man  is  primarily to clarify what authentic  being  is 
not.

The second account is the possibility of ‘Being with’  [Mitsein]  arising in the (rare) event 
that  the  Self faces  (comes  to  fear)  its  own  death.  In  this  moment,  the  Self is  able  to 
recognize  Others  as  distinct  Others  (rather than  a Man)  which  it can  relate  to,  because 
consciously  facing  death  provides  a  basis  for  authentic  Self-understanding  and,  thus,  a 
basis for recognizing its being with or, rather, alongside Others. As Robert Dostal puts it 
“the  prospect  of  death  dissolves  the  anonymous  {Man)  into  myself  and  the  other” 
(Dostal  1992:  405).  However,  while  Heidegger  in  this  context  speaks  about  solicitous 
being with Others, being-with does not rest on a social ontology but on the precondition 
that  the  Self  recognizes  itself  as  a  unique  and  ultimately  lonely  individual.  Because 
relations  with  Others  can  only  arise  on  the  basis  of gaining  authenticity  as  an  isolating

231  In  ‘the world’ the experiences made by the Self arise from encounters with other things, which 
can  be  of various  kinds.  Heidegger’s  illustrations  of the  process  of disclosing  the  world  and 
lending meaning to it often involves engagement with tools rather than other humans.

146

experience,  that  is,  by  cutting  social  bonds  rather  than  building  them,  Heidegger’s 
conception  of  Mitsein  in  one  of  a  relation  without  bonds.  As  a  consequence,  his 
treatment of human  ‘togetherness’  in the  state of authentic  solicitude remains “sketchy” 
at best (Dostal  1992: 406).232

In  sum,  while  Heidegger  recognizes  that  disclosing  the  world  in  both  authentic  and 
inauthentic  states  of being  is  tied  up  with  encountering  Others,  the  logic  he  presents 
cannot  accommodate  a  truly  social  ontology  of authentic  being.  Consequently,  rather 
than  attempting  to  think  about  the  social  dimension  of  authentic  becoming  through 
Heidegger,  it  is  necessary  to  make  a  clear  departure  from  him,  specifically  from  his 
notion  of authenticity  as  logically  tied  to  the  lonely  experience  of facing  death.  Said 
differently,  it  is  necessary  to  seek  inspiration  elsewhere  for  conceptualising  authentic 
becoming in space and time as an intersubjective experience. This task is pursued  in this 
chapter  by  (a)  picking  up  Taylor’s  (1994)  suggestion  that  an  authentic  narrative  is 
created  not through  a  monologue but through dialogue with  a significant Other and  (b) 
combine this with Robert Dostal’s point that the weakness of Heidegger’s conception of 
authentic  solicitude  becomes  apparent  when  compared  with  Aristotle’s  discussion  of 
friendship  as  a  fulfilling  relationship.233  It  thus  follows  the  line  of  reasoning  that 
“cooperation  is  ultimately based  on  understandings actors  develop about themselves,  in 
particular,  recognition  of the  importance  of relationships  to  fulfilment  of their  deepest 
needs”  (Lebow  2003:  311).  Leaving  Heidegger  behind  and  moving  to  Aristotle  as  a 
source for inspiration, the argument put forward  in this chapter, and my suggestion as to 
how  Selves  respond  to  the  anxiety  dilemma,  is  that  friendship  defined  as  an  intimate 
relationship allows for authentic unfolding within a social setting.

Friendship Matters (but is Missing from IR)
Friendship  is  complex  and  difficult  to  define,  but  scholars  exploring  the  phenomenon 
agree  that  one  of its  core  characteristics  is  intimacy.  A  review  of scholarly  definitions 
and  survey responses  suggests that friendship  is commonly understood  as a relationship 
satisfying  cognitive  and  emotional  needs  and  characterized  by  reciprocity,  trust, 
openness, honesty, acceptance, and  loyalty. Trust and openness is seen as both engaging

232  Indeed,  on the  basis  of a review of all  of Heidegger’s  publications (available by the time he 
wrote  his  article)  Dostal  concludes that  in  Heidegger’s  philosophy there  is  “no  development  of 
the understanding o f ‘Being-with’ (Mitsein)” (Dostal  1992: 408).
233  For Dostal  the  lack  of attention paid  to the phenomenon  of friendship  is  one of Heidegger’s 
great  ‘failings’, not because he was not aware of it but because his ontology provides no logical 
space for it. Thus, Mulhall’s (2005:  143f) attempt to insert friendship into Heidegger seems rather 
fruitless.

147

irn  intimate  self-disclosure  and  keeping  confidential  information,  while  honesty  and 
loyalty  is  linked  to  authenticity  and  genuine  commitments  (Fehr  1996:  3-16).  These 
features  coalesce  in  the  view  that  friendship  is  a  special  relationship  and  that  ‘true’ 
friends  are  few  in  number  (Ibid;  Allan,  1989;  Pahl,  2000),  a  view  which  sociologists 
share  with  moral  philosophers  who  see  it  as  a  particular  and  morally  significant 
relationship  affecting  the  Self (Blum  1993;  Jollimore,  2001).  Hence,  they  agree  that  a 
meaningful  understanding of friendship does  not treat  it as bond of solidarity among all 
humankind  but  as  a  partial  or  intimate  relationship  and,  thereby,  necessarily  exclusive 
(Thomas,  1993;  Friedman,  1993).  Through  this  exclusivity,  friends  are  seen  as 
reinforcing  and  moulding  each  other’s  sense  of  Self by  creating  moral  certainty  and 
social  capital  for pursuing common  projects,  capable of both  carrying and  transforming 
order through a space marked by intimacy and reciprocal assistance.234

These  insights,  which  appear  in  writings  on  friendship  all  the  way  back  to  Aristotle, 
have  not  been  picked  up  by  scholars  of  international  politics.  To  be  sure,  claims  of 
‘friendship’  and  ‘special  relationships’  are  found  regularly  in  statements of government 
officials  and  political  commentators,  and  from  Morgenthau  onwards  the  ‘friend’  is  a 
word  commonly  used  in  the  IR  literature.  However,  little  in-depth  thinking  about  the 
meaning of friendship  between  states  has occurred  in  IR.  On the rare  occasions when  it 
is  discussed,  it  is  done  thinly.  Arnold  Wolfers  discusses  the  phenomenon  of amity yet 
does  not go  beyond  describing  it  as  “a relationship  of ‘going  it with  others’”  based  on 
“ inward-oriented”  incentives such as  promoting welfare  and  peace (Wolfers  1962:  27f). 
And  Wendt,  who  notably  suggests  that  IR  needs  a  theory  of friendship,  does  not  go 
beyond  portraying  it  as  a  ‘Kantian  culture’  where  relations  are  characterized  by  non­
violence and mutual aid,  mainly differing from alliances by being expected “to continue 
indefinitely”,  which  does  not  much  more  than  echoing  Adler’s  reformulation  of 
Deutsch’s  security  community  (Wendt  1999:  298fi).  More  promising  is  Lebow’s 
drawing  on  classical  Greek  writers  to  suggest  that  friendship  is  vital  for  sustaining 
communities  through  ‘honest’  dialogue,  or  Janice  Bially  Mattem  account  of  the 
sociolinguistic  construction  of ‘special  relationships’  and  their  importance  for  building 
order.  Yet  while  offering  valuable  pointers,  they  also  do  not  engage  with  theories  of 
friendship in philosophy and social theory (Lebow, 2005; Bially Mattem, 2005a).235

234  On  friendship’s  impact on  ‘identity’,  see  See  Allan  (1989:  59ff);  Pahl  (2000:  68f),  Giddens 
(1991:  87-98).  In  contrast  to  philosophers  (Hutter  1976)  and  early  sociologists  like  Simmel 
(1950:  126),  sociologists  long  assumed that the  intimate  character of friendship  had no broader 
consequence for society. However, they changed their mind, see Allan (1989,  1998).
235  For  a  discourse  analysis  tracing  the  meaning  ‘friendship’  or  ‘amity’  has  taken  on  in 
international politics, who uses it, why, and to what effect, see Roshchin (2006).

148

The  main  reason  for the  thin  conceptualization  of friendship  in  IR  is  the  dominance  of 
the Hobbesian  ontology of the state as an autonomy-seeking entity, discussed  in chapter 
three.236  It  is  not  only  the  realist  narrative  which  is  unable  to  imagine  friendship  as  a 
special  relationship  but  also  moderate  constructivists  who  have  to  rely  on  the  social 
contract,  entered  through  reason  and/or  socialization,  as  a  theoretical  solution.  Yet 
Kantian contracting partners, keeping open the promise of universal membership, do not 
qualify as friends.237

The Issue of ‘the Other’
Even those constructivist attempts to depart from Hobbes and  rethink interstate relations 
through  a  social  ontology  have  neglected  friendship  as  an  intimate  relationship.  While 
there  is  consensus  among  constructivists  that  stabilization  of the  Self occurs  through 
ordering  practices 
is  considerable 
disagreement (if not confusion) when  it comes to  specify the  ‘nature’  of the  Self-Other 
relationship, that is,  when  it comes to the question  how to conceptualize  ‘Otherness’.238 
As noted earlier, diverse and potentially contradictory readings are rooted in the fact that 
the very notion  o f ‘identity’  contains an  insolvable tension between meaning ‘similarity’ 
(relationality) and  ‘distinctiveness’ (individuality) between which all kinds of Self-Other 
conceptualizations can flourish.239 Broadly speaking, two approaches can be identified in 
the IR literature, those emphasizing the Other as the  ‘enemy’  and those emphasizing the 
comfort of ‘the community’.

The Conservative Limit of (the Enemy ’
On  one  side  are  those  who  scrutinize  and  thereby  emphasize  that  the  Self turns  the 
‘Other’  into a negative, an opposite, an enemy.240 Scholars like David Campbell (1998a) 
argue that foreign policy is mainly about the  identification of a threatening Other for the 
purpose  of manifesting  national  Selfhood.  This  argument  rests  on  the  assumption  that 
the  Self gains  knowledge  of what  it  is  through  an  understanding  what  it  is  not.  More 
precisely,  it takes a specific  reading of the consequence  of this  differentiation,  which  is

236 On the challenge modernity’s concern  with  individualism  poses  for conceiving of friendship, 
see King and Devere (2000).
237 Wendt’s  ‘Kantian’ reading of friendship as a (potentially global) non-war community must be 
differentiated  from  Kant’s  own  discussion  of  friendship,  which  Blum  describes  as  being 
“sensitive and sensible” (Blum,  1993:  203).  Kant recognized that “to be the friend of everybody 
is impossible, for friendship is a particular relationship” (cited in Jollimore, 2001: 43).

inspired  by  William  Connolly’s  argument  that  identity  “requires  difference”  which  is 
then  turned  into  (negative)  otherness  (Connolly  1991:  64).  To  put  it  briefly,  Connolly 
argues  that  the  dualism  of good  and  evil  is  not  only  central  to  religious  doctrines  but 
underlies  all  constructions  of  identity.  Only  through  distinctiveness  is  the  particular 
identity  of the  Self assured,  and  this  difference  is  turned  into (negative)  otherness,  that 
is,  degenerates  into  a hierarchical  relationship to  reassure the  identity,  or  sense  of Self, 
as  “intrinsically  good,  coherent,  complete”  (Ibid.  65).  Eager  to  guard  the  (illusion  of) 
‘true’  identity,  those  questioning  this  truth  are  declared  evil,  or  irrational/mad  in  the 
secular  version  (Ibid.  8).  While  according  to  Connolly  this  “problem  of evil”  resides 
within  “structures  of personal  identity  and  social  order”  (Ibid,  3),  he  notes that turning 
difference  into (negative) otherness  is  a “temptation”  rather than  a disposition.  Adopted 
to the terminology used here, one would say that negative Othering is used as an anxiety 
controlling mechanism.

The focus on the ‘negative Other’  is also dominant among scholars who see international 
politics through a Schmittian lens, that is, who accept Carl Schmitt’s (1932) definition of 
the  political  as  a  decision  identifying enemies  and  friends.  As  Schmitt’s  primary  point 
was to locate the meaning of politics in the act of making the distinction, not speculating 
about the specific meaning this distinction may take, the  ‘friends’  category only appears 
as  fundamental  to  politics  because  it  is the  opposite  of enemy,  not  because  it  possesses 
an  intrinsic  value.  Friendship  is  substantiated  neither  by  Schmitt  nor  by  any  of  his 
adaptations  in  IR,  if anything,  Schmitt  is  read  as  “the  thinker  of the  enemy”  (Derrida 
1997:  161).241

Scholars  emphasizing  that  Selves  focus  on  the  ‘negative  Other’,  or  the  enemy,  as  the 
stabilizing relationship  could  argue that this  allows  for the  generation  and  maintenance 
of an  authentic  sense  of  Self.  Indeed,  this  argument  would  even  allow  maintaining  a 
Heideggerian  notion  of authenticity  because the enemy  raises the  spectre  of ones  death 
by  holding with  Derrida that “the true  enemy  is  a  better friend  than  the  friend.  For the 
enemy  can  hate  and  wage  war  on  me  (...)  if he  desires  my  death,  at  least  he  desires 
it... singularly” (Derrida  1997:  72).  Yet even if one would find a way to ground  ‘hate’  in 
an  account of the human condition, there are  a number of problems with this argument. 
First,  a process  of ‘negative Othering’  says very little about the  Self except that there  is 
something  it  is  not.  Second,  if  a  positive  sense  of  Self  is  gained  by  being  hated,  a 
relationship of mutual  hatred  and,  hence,  confrontation  favours  a conservative ontology

of the  parties  involves.  Hate  necessarily  is  fixated  on  a  certain  image  of  Self  and, 
therefore,  is  ill  suited  for  conceptualizing the  relationship  as  a  source  for  the  creative 
unfolding,  more  suitable  for  a  realist  ontology  of states  as  fixed  entities.242  Third,  as 
visible  in Connolly and Campbell,  it risks  losing the social  dimension. The formation of 
national  Selfhood  is  a domestic  enterprise  where the  Other  is  merely  a  passive  enemy- 
image,  without  agency,  constructed 
the  purpose  of  demarcating  national 
boundaries.243 Finally, while an account emphasizing mutual  hatred could accommodate 
the  desire  for  recognition  stressed  by  social  theorists,  it  cannot  account  for  the 
complementary  desire  to  belong.  This  latter  point  will  need  to  be  looked  at  more 
carefully.

The Elusiveness o f ‘the Community’
The  view  that  desires  of belonging  and  recognition  drive  behaviour  is  found  among 
scholars  exploring  ‘positive’  identification  and  the  formation  of social  or  ‘collective’ 
identity  (see  chapter  three).244  After  Mead,  the  social  dimension  of  Selfhood  was 
captured  in  Erik  Erikson’s  notion  of ‘collective  identity’  and  has been  further explored 
by social  psychologists,  most notably through the  development of social  identity theory 
around  Henri  Tajfel,  who  argued  that  collective  identity  is  seen  as  “that  part  of  an 
individual’s  self-concept  which  derives  from  his  knowledge  of  his  membership  in  a 
social  group” (Tajfel  1978:  63).245 The  key argument coming out of this  research  is that 
groups  make  individuals  ‘feel  good’  by  satisfying  desires  of  belonging.246  In  what 
echoes Anderson’s  (1999) notion  o f ‘simultaneity’, the desire for  ‘belonging’  is  seen  as 
expressing  the  Selfs  desire  to  have  access  to  stable  structures  of meaning and  thereby 
provide cognitive-emotional  assurance.  Brubaker and  Cooper mention the  “emotionally 
laden  sense  of belonging  to  a  distinctive,  bounded  group”  as  an  important  avenue  for 
researchers  of the  formation  of  Selfhood  (Brubaker  and  Cooper  2000:  19).  Logically 
desires for belonging are only satisfied when met with  recognition, the need of which  is 
a prominent element in  Hegelian philosophy and revived by Axel  Honneth, who  locates 
the  desire  for  recognition  in  Mead’s  ‘I’  to  suggest  that  the  claim  to  recognition  “is 
anchored  in  every subject as  an  enduring motive”  (in  Haacke  2005:  88;  Honneth  2003; 
see also Gutmann  1994).

242  See  also the  argument by  Mitzen  (2006)  of how  states  become  locked-into  a relationship  of 
rivalry.
243 This risk also arises in the conceptualization of friendship, see below.

incentives  for 

interstate  cooperation.  For 

A number of IR scholars have used these insights to argue that desires for belonging and 
recognition  are 
instance,  Larson  and 
Shevchenko (2003) argue that Gorbachev’s new thinking was  a consequence of seeking 
recognition  by  ‘the  West’  as  a  great  power,  Merje  Kuus  (2001)  shows  that  Estonian 
security  discourse  in  the  1990s  and  the  question  of  NATO  membership  primarily 
evolved  around  the  aim  of  becoming  a  member  of  ‘the  West’.  Wendt  (2003)  even 
suggests that the desire  for recognition  will  lead  states to  form  a world  state.  These  are 
useful  pointers,  yet for the  current  purpose these  arguments  have  one  weakness.  While 
desires  for belonging and  recognition  can  be  read  as  expressions  of the  SelFs  desire to 
tame anxiety by being with Others, the suggestion that these desires are satisfied through 
‘group membership’  or being part of a ‘community’ does not quite work as well when  it 
comes to  satisfying a  desire  of authenticity.  Conceptually,  the terms of ‘collective’  and 
‘community’  are just  one  step  away  from  Heideggers’  Man  and  too  broad/generic  for 
hosting  a  Self seeking  authenticity.247  For  this,  a  focus  on  friendship  emphasizing  the 
particular/special relationship is necessary.

To be sure, some studies recognize the importance of special relationships. One group of 
scholars  speaks  of  “distinct  communities”  expressed  in  metaphorical  structures  of 
‘family  of nations’  (Brysk  et  al.,  2002:  268),  yet this  remains  vague  conceptually just 
like Huntington’s notion of “kin-countries” (Huntington,  1993:  35).  More  indicative are 
Thomas  Risse-Kappens’  analysis  of bilateral  relations  among  NATO  allies  during  the 
Cold  War  and  Bially  Mattem’s  account  of the  British-US  relationship  during the  Suez 
crisis  (Risse-Kappen  1995;  Bially  Mattem,  2005a).  Both  focus  on  the  interdependence 
of two  specific  state  ‘identities’,  embedded  in  broader  conception  of  ‘the  West’.  An 
understanding  of ‘the  West’  as  a  shared  project  must  not  necessarily  lead  to  a  falling 
back 
into  the  ‘group  membership’  narrative.  However,  rather  than  theoretically 
anchoring this  ‘West’  as something devised from within the special relationship,  in their 
discussion the special relationship ends up as a function of the East-West conflict. From 
here  it is not far to Jonathan Mercer’s (1995) adaptation of social  identity theory, where 
the  value  of  group  membership  is  reduced  to  winning  a  competition  against  another 
group  and,  thus,  where  the  negative  Other  returns  in  form  of  an  ‘out-group’  as  the 
decisive factor which keeps the ‘in-group’ together.

247 For a critique of IR’s use o f ‘collective identity’, see Weller (1999), for ‘community’  see Tilly 
(1996) and Brown (1995). For a more substantial treatment see the introduction to Adler (2003).

Where  to  go  for a  conceptualization  of Selfhood  formed  within  a special relationship? 
Interestingly,  one  place  is  Mead’s  discussion  of the  formation  of the  ‘M e’,  the  same 
source  that  generated  the  quasi-consensus  among  scholars  that  the  social  element  of 
Selfhood  is  provided  by  ‘community’  or  ‘group  membership’.  This  consensus  brushes 
over Mead’s account of the  socialization  process  as one  emphasising two  stages:  in the 
early  stage  of  development  the  Self  gains  particular  experiences  in  interaction  with 
“significant others”, such as family members or friends, and only  in the second stage the 
individual’s  identity  forms through  adaptation to the  larger community, which  he terms 
the  “generalized  other”  (Mead  1934:  154),  which  blends  with  Heidegger’s  Man.  The 
reason  why  the  crucial  role  of the  ‘significant  other’  in  the  self-fulfilment  process  has 
been  ignored  by  scholars  can  be  explained  with  Mead  reducing  its  relevance to  a  mere 
‘first  phase’  or  ‘stage’  and  his  subsequent  argument  that  “the  essential  basis  and 
prerequisite  of the  fullest  development”  occurs  through  the  adaptation  to  the  ‘general 
Other’  (Ibid.).  In  that  sense,  Mead’s  ontology  deems  the  ‘generalized  other’  as  more 
relevant than the ‘significant other’.

This  thesis  suggests  the  reverse.  It  picks  up  on  Mead’s  insight  that  self  fulfillment 
emerges out of a conversation between  ‘I’  and  ‘Me’  yet without allowing for the Self to 
get  lost  in  a  conversation  with  the  ‘general  Other’.  Said  differently,  the  task  here  is  to 
retrieve the  ‘significant Other’  as the one “whose opinion matters most”248 as the partner 
who  can  satisfy  both  desires  of  belonging/recognition  and  authenticity.  In  Taylor’s 
words,  “the  key  loci  of self-discovery  and  self-affirmation”  is  found  on  the  “intimate 
level” (Taylor,  1994;  36),  which  is to say that  in  their attempt to  combine the desire for 
authenticity  with  the  desire  for  belonging/recognition,  ‘individuals’  seek  intimate 
relations.  The  next  step  is  to  conceptually  ground  such  relations  in  friendship  by  going 
back to Aristotle.249

Aristotle:  Others as Selves

Friendship  is  a  central  theme  in  Aristotle’s  Nicomachean  Ethics  (NE),  which  is  still 
considered  the  most  substantial  work  on  the  subject.250  For  Aristotle,  as  for  most 
philosophers  in  ancient  Greece,  friends  are  an  essential  part of life,  “for  no  one  would

248 The definition of the ‘significant other’  is from  Hoelter (1984: 255).
249 Taylor  does  not pursue the  friendship perspective,  given  his  stance that “it would be  utterly 
wrong...to draw the boundaries any narrower than around the whole human race”  (Taylor  1989: 
6f).  See also Giddens’  discussion  of ‘pure’  relationships,  friendship being one,  which  he sees  as 
of “elementary importance for the reflexive project of the Self’ (Giddens,  1991: 87-98).

choose to live without friends, even if he possessed all the other goods” (NE, Book VIII, 
1).  Beyond  the  common  assumption  of his  days  about the  sociability  of human  nature, 
Aristotle  sees  friends  as  central  to  the  individual’s  attempt  to  achieve  virtue  and 
happiness,  which  he  considers  the  highest  goal  in  life.  (NE,  Book  I).  Happiness  is 
associated  with  stability,  and  thus  as  something which  opens the  experience  of time by 
giving faith and certainty (Derrida  1997:  15). More than cognitive certainty, happiness is 
“a certain sort of activity of the soul  in accord with virtue” and, thus, an emotional state. 
It  also  is  not  a  property  one  is  bom  with,  or  which  can  be  obtained  in  isolation,  but 
something that comes into being through activity with friends (NE,  Book IX, 9).  In  line 
with  some  commentators,  this  fundamental  human  sociability  and  the  emotional  desire 
to  be with  others  is  read  here  as  a  response  to  anxiety.251  In  other words,  the  emphasis 
that  friends  are  vital  for  emotional  well-being  (happiness)  is  understood  to  mean  a 
feeling  of  having  satisfied  desires  for  belonging  and  recognition  without  loosing 
authenticity.  In  that  sense,  Aristotle  provides  an  account  of  how  self  sufficiency  is 
relational “dependent upon and interwoven with others” (Sherman  1993: 94).

Aristotle differentiates between  three different types of friendship,  namely friendship of 
utility,  of pleasure,  and  of excellence  (NE,  Book VIII,  3).252  Only the  latter amounts to 
excellent or  ‘true’  friendship,  because  in the  first two cases  friendship  is  ‘instrumental’ 
in  the  sense  that  it  cannot  contribute  to  true  happiness.253  A  state  of  happiness,  for 
Aristotle,  is  a  state  of moral  fulfillment  and  true  friendship  “is  the  friendship  of good 
people similar  in virtue” (NE,  Book VIII:  3).  Virtue  is difficult to define  in the  abstract 
yet can be broadly defined as knowing what is  ‘the right thing to do’. In accordance with 
his  view  that  happiness  is  achieved  through  activity  (or  experience)  Aristotle  also 
emphasizes that virtue  is  expressed  not  only  in  knowing what  is  ‘right’  but  also  acting 
accordingly.254 Moreover, in what nicely fits into the perspective of authentic becoming, 
for  Aristotle  virtue  is  neither  a  fixed  property  nor  acquired  naturally  but  obtainable 
primarily through  activity with  friends.  As  Sherman  points  out,  this  means that  friends 
not  only  choose  each  other on  the  basis  of a  shared  ‘sense  of...commitment and  ends,

251  Smith Pangle (2003:  15); Sherman (1993:  95).
252  Aristotle  notes  that  complete  friendship  may  well  accommodate  the  previous  two.  For  an 
influential discussion of the different forms of friendship, see Cooper (1980).
253 See also Smith Pangle (2003: 39ff); Pahl, (2000:  13ff).
254  For  Aristotle  virtue  is  about  finding  an  intermediate  between  excess  and  deficiency,  about 
expressing  feelings  such  as  pity,  pleasure,  anger,  or pain  in  an  appropriate  and  measured  way. 
Having these  feelings  “at the  right time,  about the  right things,  toward the  right  people,  for the 
right end, and in the right way...is proper to virtue” (NE, Book II: 6). For an attempt to pin down 
Aristotle’s  notion  of virtue,  see  Smith-Pangle  (2003:  143-5).  To  “walk together  in  the  path  of 
virtue” also underlies the Confucian conception of friendship, see Kutcher (2000:  1618).

and  a  sense  of  what  we  take  to  be  ultimately  good’,  they  also  develop  their  moral 
capacities  together  over  time  (Sherman  1993:  97).  In  what  points  to  a  creative 
relationship  of  mutual  learning,  from  an  Aristotelian  perspective  “the  virtuous  agent 
continues to grow,  and  ...  friendship itself is the most congenial context for such  moral 
growth” (Ibid., 99). Hence, friends are functioning both as “moral witnesses” (Friedman) 
to  each  other  and  as  active  generators  of the  moral  space  in  and  through  which  their 
Selves unfold.255  For Aristotle the true friend thus takes on the role of another-Self. The 
“shared  life” (Sherman) of friends is marked by two important features worth  looking at 
more closely.

Reciprocity
First,  friendship  operates  on  a  unique  logic  of  reciprocity.  In  his  discussion  of  the 
‘Object  of  Friendship’  Aristotle  emphasises  that  friendship  is  based  on  reciprocated 
goodwill  (NE,  Book  VIII,  2  and  8;  Smith-Pangle,  2003:  142ff).  In  the  case  of  ‘true’ 
friendship,  such  reciprocity  does  not  follow  a  ‘tit-for-tat’  logic  and  cannot  be  seen  in 
terms of an  instrumental  or utilitarian notion of exchange.256 Although he notes that “we 
should,  generally speaking, return what we owe” (NE, Book  IX, 2),  and that friendships 
between  those  in  formally  unequal  positions  (see  below)  have  to  give  proportionally, 
Aristotle argues that “friendship seeks what is possible, not what accords with worth”, as 
returning  what  is  ‘worth’  is  impossible  in  some  cases  (NE,  Book  VIII,  14,  emphasis 
added).  In the case where there  is a friendship between  unequals,  Aristotle  suggests the 
returns  are  (should  be)  different:  “the  superior  should  get  more  honour,  and  the  needy 
person more profit” (Ibid.).

However,  it  appears  there  really can  be  no  expectations  among true  friends  about what 
exactly  is being returned.  As Aristotle puts  it,  “friends who give services because of the 
friend  himself are  not  open  to  accusation  [of  inappropriate  return]  since  this  is  the 
character  of  friendship  that  accords  with  virtue”.  Any  return  that  is  made  “is  not 
measured  by  money  and  no  equivalent  honour  can  be  paid;  but  it  is  enough  ...  to  do 
what  we  can”  (NE,  Book  XI,  1).  Hence,  there  can  be  no  ‘accusations’  for  inadequate 
returns  in  true  friendship,  simply  because  both  aim  for  what  is  good,  and  because  the 
good is shared both benefit from activities contributing to it (NE, Book VIII,  13). Hence, 
the notion of ‘debt’  as commonly understood  has no place among friends, and the value 
of services  exchanged  is  unique  to  their  relationship  and  cannot  be  objectively  fixed.

255 The notion of the friend as a ‘moral witness’  comes from Friedman (1993).
256  Hutter  (1978:  3);  Pahl  (2000:  55).  On  the  utilitarian  notion  of reciprocity  as  used  in  game 
theory, see Axelrod (1984: 4ff.).

155

Friends  trust  each  other that  they  contribute  what  they  can/deem  necessary,  and  so  “if 
friends  ‘owe’  [each  other]  anything,  it  is  only  thanks”  (Smith  Pangle  2003:  128). 
Furthermore,  Aristotle  notes  that  friends  would  neither  provide  ‘bad’  action  for  each 
other, nor request such action from the friend.  Instead, Aristotle appears to endorse well- 
meant  criticism  among  friends  when  he  suggests  that  “it  is  proper  to  good  people  to 
avoid error themselves and not to permit it in their friends” (NE, Book VIII, 8).

Although the precise logic of this reciprocity remains unclear, there is no doubt true that 
for Aristotle  friendship  involves a unique  kind  of ‘reciprocity’  which  serves  both  sides 
as a mean to further and display virtue and reach  ‘inner harmony’ (i.e. tame anxiety) and 
is  characterised  by  the  fact that  friends  ‘wish  good  to  each  other  for  each  other’s  own 
sake” (NE, Book VIII, 3).257 Hence, something done ‘for’ the friend cannot be seen as an 
exchange  occurring  between  distinct  individuals,  just  like  wishing  each  other  well 
cannot be grasped  in terms of ‘selfless’  behaviour but is better seen as a merging o f self- 
interest and other-interest.258

Equality
The  unique  logic  of  reciprocity  is  intrinsically  linked,  second,  to  friendship  as  a 
relationship  among  ‘equals’.  By  definition,  the  Aristotelian  notion  of true  friendship 
formed among those similar in virtue  is one characterised  by equality,  as the friend who 
perceives  the  Other  as  ‘another  Self  cannot  conceive  of  this  Other  as  inferior  or 
superior.  Equality  in  friendship,  then,  does  not  refer  to  a  right  but  to  a  recognition  of 
mutual  benefit,  contributing  to  each  other’s  happiness  (NE,  Book  VIII,  2,  3  and  Book 
IX,  8). Yet while true friends necessarily recognise each other as equal  in this sense, the 
question  is  whether  this  is  affected  by  and  can  be  upheld  in  a  situation  in  which  the 
individuals  stand  in  a  formal  institutional  or  otherwise  functional  relationship  of 
hierarchy. Here, Aristotle is ambiguous.

On  the  one  hand,  he  suggests  that  inequality  in  standing  can  be  compensated  through 
similarity  in  virtue and  mutual  love,  a view echoed  by  most theorists  of friendship who 
consider  it  the  one  thing  which  can  transcend  otherwise  divisive  hierarchies  (Aristotle 
suggests  that  superiority  in  power  and  position  rarely  goes  along  with  superiority  of

257  Reciprocity  was  also  important  for Socrates,  who  equally struggled  with grasping 
(Smith  Pangle  2003:  21f).  For a comprehensive  discussion of how  a logic  of consequentialism
has no place in friendship, see Jollimore (2001).

its  nature

156

virtue).259  It  is  clear  that  the  gap  influences  the  logic  of reciprocity;  however  it  is  less 
clear to what extent it suffices to recognize each other as virtuous and adapt the ‘returns’ 
as  noted  above,  and  to  what extent the  gap  puts  more  burden  on  the  formally  ‘inferior’ 
side  to  ‘give  more’.  Certainly  Aristotle  emphasizes  that  there  are  different  kinds  of 
inequality and suggests that each “must make the return that is proportionate to the types 
of  superiority”  (NE,  Book  VIII,  13).  On  the  other  hand,  Aristotle  argues  that  true 
friendship between  ruler and  ruled  is difficult,  if not impossible, as  is being friends with 
kings or gods. The emergence of significant and gaps in, for instance, wealth  is  likely to 
corrupt  the  logic  of  reciprocity  among  friends  by  generating  unequal  expectations, 
thereby  becoming a cause for the dissolution  of friendships (NE,  Book VIII,  7  and  14). 
This  theme  will  be  taken  up  again  in  the  next  chapter.  For now,  it  suffices  to  say that 
while  Aristotle’s  ambiguity  regarding  the  prospects  of  friendship  across  formal 
hierarchies does not invite conclusive or one-sided arguments, at least not in the abstract, 
it  can  be  said  that  considering  and  treating  each  other as  ‘equal’  despite  differences  in 
‘standing’  is a fundamental aspect of friendship.

In  sum,  Aristotle  confirms the  need  for  ‘being with’  and  grounds  it  in  friendship  as  an 
intimate social  space marked  by equality and a unique  logic of reciprocity. Yet how can 
these  insights  be translated  to  relations  among  states?  More  precisely,  how  can they  be 
inserted  into the  causal  narrative  seeking to  explain  government decisions  for  investing 
in  international  security  institutions?  The  remainder  of  this  chapter  is  devoted  to 
answering this question.

The ‘In-Between’ of Friendship
For the  purpose  of conceptualizing  interstate relations  as  friendship,  it  is  useful  to  start 
by confirming that ‘friendship’  is actually a relationship and, thus, can be political.  This 
is necessary because Aristotle’s notion of true friendship as an extension of self-love can 
be  seen  as  collapsing  the  Self  with  the  Other.  As  Derrida  suggests,  when  Aristotle 
emphasises  “friendship  seems  to  consist  more  in  loving  than  being  loved”  (NE,  Book 
VIII,  8 and  Book  IX) he seems to place more importance on  ‘knowing rather than being 
known’,  making the  friend  a  narcissist  construct  rather than  something  arising  between 
individuals.  Hence,  Derrida  criticises  Aristotle’s  understanding  of true  friendship  for 
being  ‘total’  and  ignoring  difference,  that  is,  for  not  recognizing  the  separateness  of

259 NE,  Book VIII, 7  and  11.  Aristotle even  notes that friendship  is possible between master and 
slave  insofar as they recognize each other as human beings (NE,  Book VIII,  11).  See also Hutter 
(1978); Kutcher (2000). For a view that Aristotle does not provide a convincing account for ‘true 
friendship’ across hierarchies, see Smith Pangle (2003:  101f.).

157

Selves  (Derrida  1997:  11).  The  reading  of  true  friends  linked  by  an  organic  bond 
merging  Self and  Other  is  similar to  what  Hannah  Arendt  calls  ‘fraternity’,  a  label  she 
uses  for  relations  grounded  in  unconditional  love  and  characterised  by  closure  and 
homogeneity. Such relations for Arendt are apolitical, even antipolitical because they are 
akin  to  natural  relations:  “love...destroys  the  in-between  which  relates  us  to  and 
separates us from others” (Arendt,  1958: 242; Chiba  1995).260

One does not need to read totality  into Aristotle’s notion of true friendship, certainly not 
if reciprocity is considered the ‘object’ of friendship and if there is room for disputes and 
the dissolution of friendship.261  Yet those voices are  important to remind us that in order 
to  conceptualize  friendship  as  a political  relationship  it  must  be  conceived  “through  a 
philosophy  of difference  so  as  to  be  rendered  politically  relevant”  (Chiba,  1995:  522). 
This does not compromise the understanding of friendship as an  intimate relationship262 
but points to the ‘in-between’ of friendship as the space where the bonding occurs.

In  IR  terminology,  it  requires  conceptualizing  friendship  between  states  through  the 
‘inter’  (of the  international).  As  Fred  Halliday notes,  the  ‘inter’  is  basically understood 
to  denote  “links  between  states”  (Halliday  1994:  6).263  For  approaches  grounded  in  a

the  space  outside  Westphalian  borders  with  their dual  nature  as  a  simultaneous  divider 
and  the  arena  where  states  come  to  meet.  This  ‘meeting’  space  is  a  realm  defined  by 
strategic  interaction,  also  called  a  ‘theatre’  (Aron,  1966:  183),  where  states  are  reduced 
to  ‘actors’  calculating  how  to  achieve  their  objectives  by  taking  into  account  the 
presence, understood as the activities and resources, of other  ‘actors’  (Ibid,  191;  Ruggie

heterogeneity  and  potentially  global  (Chiba,  1995:  520).  Like  Derrida,  Arendt views  politics  as 
based  on  the  plurality  of  being,  as  “about  togetherness  and  being-with  of  the  diverse  [der 
Verschiedenen]”.  Politics  for  her  is  about  managing  relations  and  thus  “develops  in  the  in- 
between and manifests itself as the relation” (Arendt 2003: 9f. emphasis added).

Even though the  latter two perspectives gradually compromise the  Waltzian’  reading of 
the  ‘inter’  as  a  realm  ontologically  separate  from  ‘the  state’,  the  ‘inter’  still  remains  a 
space of strategic interaction and, thus, reduced to “points of convening” (Latham 2002: 
133).  The  idea of interstate friendship as a relationship revolving around a shared  sense 
o f ‘being-in-the-world’ offers a different reading, as discussed next.

Defining International Friendship

To begin with, friendships do not form  because of geographic proximity, economic ties, 
or some kind of increased ‘interaction’.264 And while similar religions or similar political 
systems  designate  broad  ideas  of order embedded  in  histories  and  visions  for the  good 
life,  they  do  not  provide  sufficient  ground  for  friendship  bonds.  They  are  too  broad  to 
satisfy  the  desire  for  authenticity  and  meaningfully  capture  the  particularity  of 
friendship.  These  factors  may,  individually  or  in  combination,  facilitate  the  emergence 
and  maintenance  of  friendship,  yet  by  themselves  they  do  not  make  for  intimate 
relations.  For  friendships  to  form  and  sustain,  there  must  be  some  sort  of ‘attraction’. 
The concept is useful because it provides an alternative to the socialization argument and 
recognizes  that  friendship  is  a  voluntary  relationship,  based  on  choice.  If we  combine 
this with the definition of the significant Other as that one “whose opinion matters most” 
(Hoelter  1984:  255),  we  arrive  at  Peter  Blau’s  note  that,  generally  speaking,  attraction 
rests  on  approving  of each  others  opinions  (Blau  1964:  69).  On  the  question  opinions 
about what, the answer offered  here picks up the threads developed  in the discussion  so 
far.265

In  basic  terms,  states  form  a  friendship through  a  shared  project of ‘world  building’  in 
which their national  biographies are embedded.  More specifically,  friendship designates 
a an  intimate  relationship  revolving around  a  shared  sense  of ‘being-in-the-world’,  that 
is,  a shared  sense  of situatedness  in  space  and time within  which  structures  of meaning 
are established.  Bonds of friendship develop through a shared experienced space and the 
agreement of transforming  it  into  a  shared  envisioned  space  by  coming to  agree  on  an 
idea of the  good order, that  is,  by agreeing on  lessons  from  significant experiences  and 
how to translate them  into a common project lending significance to a shared future. One 
could say their  ‘inner time’  becomes  ‘social time’ through a convergence of horizons of 
experience and  expectations, through the formulation of a shared utopia inscribed  into a

264 On how increased interaction does not necessarily create communal bonds, see Brown (1996).
265  Like Aristotle,  for contemporary  scholars there is no blueprint or  ‘typical’  form  of friendship 
(Allan,  1989; Porter and Tomaselli,  1989; Fehr,  1996).

159

certain  space  to  which  the  parties  become  emotionally  attached  and  commit to.  In  that 
sense,  one could  adapt C.  S.  Lewis’  suggestion that friends  at any point  in time give an 
affirmative  answer  to  the  question  Do  you  see  the  same  truth?  (Lewis  1993:  42)  by 
changing the question to Do you see the same world?  Seeking and sustaining that Other 
which sincerely answers ‘yes’  is the ‘common interest’  in friendship.

Yet  ‘sharing’  in  the  sense  of agreeing  to  ‘see  the  same  world’  does  not  mean  a  total 
merger, which would take away the space of the in-between. To reiterate the point made 
with  regard  to  Aristotle’s  notion  of true  friendship,  there  never  is  a  total  merger  of 
national  biographies  and  so  friends  can  never completely  ‘know’  each  other (although, 
as discussed  in the next chapter, they may be mislead to think they do).  In a fundamental 
sense this  is  because,  as  discussed  earlier,  the  temporal  dimension  of the  Self makes  it 
impossible to ever ‘know’  itself in  its entirety simply because the Self is always also not- 
yet. Yet also the worlds they disclose and  inscribe with meaning over the course of their 
unfolding and  the  visions  they  contain  cannot  be  identical.  An  agreement of seeing the 
‘same world’  really is an agreement, and  is perhaps better understood as a commitment, 
confirmed through practice, for an intimately shared world which both consider possible 
and desirable. To use the terminology of the Sprouts, the milieu’s two states are situated 
in  may  overlap  to  greater  or  lesser  degree  (and  in  the  case  of friends  the  overlap  is 
obviously great) but “no two  [states]  are environed by exactly the  same milieu” (Sprout 
and  Sprout  1965:  204).  The  shared  world  and  its  horizons  delineating the  shared  moral 
space must always allow for some “personal maneuvering space” (Herzfeld 2002).

The  primary  reason  why  the  conception  of the  ‘in-between’  cannot  be  identical  is,  of 
course,  because  the  variety  (or  uniqueness)  of  experiences  makes  a  truly  common 
history  impossible  (Wagner  2002).  While  significant  experiences  are  ambiguous,  as 
discussed  in  the  previous  chapter,  this  lack  of  determinism  not  only  makes  the 
generation  of a  shared  world  possible  but  also  means  that  even  those  who  share  the 
experience  never completely  agree  on  what to  do  with  it,  that  is,  on  its  representation. 
Within  a  society,  the  lessons  learned  from  significant  experiences  are  often  contested 
and  so  the  shared  place  in  the  past  is  a  compromise,  an  act  of  negotiation  over 
representations  and  lessons  with  the  view  towards  the  creation  of  commonalities.  It 
emerges in “the  interaction between those who propose to the see the past as  something 
shared,  and  those  who  let  themselves  be  convinced  to  accept  such  representation  for 
their own orientation in the...world” (Wagner 2002:  51).

160

Thus,  friendship  is  a  project  of shared  world  building.  In  this  process  of devising  a 
common storyline both sides feel comfortable with shared utopia/visions play a key role. 
As  discussed  earlier,  the  future  is  not  only  a  source  o f anxiety  but  also  a  source  of 
energy.  Because  of its  openness,  the  future  has  more  room  for  shared  world  building 
than  memory:  it  is  through  agreeing  to  a  common  place  in  the  future  that  memory 
spaces,  and the  lessons  learned  from them, can  be  adjusted.  And  it  is  also  in the shared 
vision  of the  ‘good  order’  where  trust  is  established.  Trust,  which  in  general  terms  is 
about  “plac[ing]  the  fate  of ones  interest  under the  control  of others”  (Hoffman  2006: 
17),  is  fundamentally  about  the  future,  about  expectations  that  my  becoming  is  taken 
into  account  “in  some  relevant  way”.266  As  Giddens  points  out,  trust  is  based  not  so 
much  on  past  experiences,  let  alone  subject  to  a  rational  decision-making  process,  but 
presumes  “a  leap  to  commitment,  a  quality  of  ‘faith’  which  is  irreducible”  (Giddens 
1991:  19).  While  in  friendship  this  faith  may  not  be  ‘reducible’  it  is  anchored  in  the 
understanding that  there  is  a  mutual  commitment to  build  a  shared  world.  Friends  trust 
each  other  because  the  shared  vision  which  aligns  horizons  of  expectations  is  not 
controlled by one or the other but produced together.

Friendship as Empowerment

For  specifying  the  process  of world  building  we  must  return  to  the  question  of  the 
political  in  friendship.  Here  it  is  important to  note  that the  exclusiveness  of friendship 
does  not  require  falling  into  a  Schmittian  reading  of politics  as  making  the  distinction 
between  friends  and  enemies,  a  reading  which  inevitably  produces  a  black-and-white 
reading  of  the  international  (Behnke  2004).  While  friends  may  come  to  agree  on  a 
common  enemy,  no  serious  philosophy/sociology  of friendship,  and  certainly  not  one 
inspired by Aristotle, considers enmity vis-a-vis third parties to be a necessary condition 
for creating  bonds  of friendship.  After  all,  the  very  reason  why  sociologists  have  long 
ignored  friendship  is  because  it  is  in  many  respects  an  inward-oriented  relationship. 
While  friendship  does  have  external  effects  (see  below),  it  excludes  but  does  not 
automatically  oppose  others.  Consequently,  the  argument  made  here  goes  against  the 
view  that  a  stable  sense  of  Self  requires  both  an  Other  the  Self  identifies  with  (the 
‘friend’) and one it identifies against (the  ‘enemy’), as in Zygmunt Baumann’s assertion 
that “building and keeping order means making friends and fighting enemies” (Baumann 
1991:  24).  Rather,  it suggests that intimate relations are outnumbered by relations where

266  See  also  Russel  Hardin’s  account of trust  in  relationships:  “I trust you  with  respect to  some 
action if your reason for doing it is to take me into account in some relevant way. Typically your 
reason  will  be  that  it  is  in  your  interest to  maintain  our relationship.  Hence,  my  trust  in  you  is 
typically  encapsulated  in  your  interest  in  fulfilling  my  trust”  (in  Hoffman  2006:  21).  See  also 
footnote  15.

there  is  no  commitment  to  shared  world  building  and  where  no  emotional  stakes  are 
involved,  an  image  where  friends  are  surrounded  by  what  has  been  called  “familiar 
strangers” (Milgram  1972).

For the Aristotelian conception of politics as finding the (common) good  it  is redundant 
to  ask  for the  ‘political’  in  friendship relations.  But  if political  relations  are  understood 
with  Karl  Deutsch  (1967)  as  relations  of  ‘power’  this  needs  to  be  specified.  Within 
friendship relations one can  identify two  interrelated types of power phenomena, one of 
empowerment  and  one  of ‘soft  power  over’.  The  latter  will  be  picked  up  in  the  next 
chapter;  here  the  argument  is  that  by  taming  anxiety  and  providing  self-confidence, 
friendship is a source of empowerment for authentic becoming.

As noted by all scholars since Aristotle, learning from each other is intrinsic to unfolding 
within  friendship  and  an  important  source  for  ‘moral  growth’  and  provision  of 
happiness,  that  is,  of  taming  anxiety.  In  stabilizing  the  horizons  of  each  others’ 
biographical narratives, friendship processes are mutually strengthening Self-confidence 
and,  in  this  sense,  also  enhance  a  sense  of  Self-sufficiency.  Yet  the  creative  force 
emerging out of friendship relations, the energy drawn from  imagining a common future 
and the resolve to engage in a shared project is not merely stabilizing, it is empowering. 
This process of ‘world building’ (Chiba  1995:  523) expresses Arendt’s reading of power 
as  the  ability  “to  act  in  concert”  and  to  achieve/produce  something  together  (Arendt 
1970:  44).  In  other words, the  power at work  here  is productive  (power-to)  rather than 
coercive  (power-over).  It  not  captured  in  the  “opportunity  [Chance]  to  have  one’s  will 
prevail  [durchsetzen]  within a social relationship”, as in Max Weber’s famous definition 
(Weber  1976:  28,  author’s translation)  but  in  the  creative  potential  of the  ‘in-between’, 
that is, power is expressed  in an  ‘emerging property’  generated through social exchange 
(Blau  1964), rather than by having something pre-existing prevail.

Importantly,  in  this  process  of world  building,  friendship  does  not  merely  ‘strengthen’ 
the  Self but  inevitably transforms  it as  well  (Friedman  1993:  195-202;  Allan  1989).  As 
noted earlier, national biographies cannot ever become identical and, indeed, the creative 
potential  of friendship  is  drawn  from  unique  understandings  of ‘being-in-the-world’.  It 
builds on a conception  of inner time  in which experiences and  expectations are formed, 
enables  to  exchange  views  and  provide  each  other with  slightly  different  perspectives, 
thereby stimulating the learning process. As Marilyn Friedman notes,

162

“the  experiences,  projects,  and  dreams  of our  friends  can  frame  for  us 
new  standpoints  from  which  we  can  experience  the  significance  and 
worth  of moral  values  and  standards.  In  friendship,  our  commitment to 
our  friends,  as  such,  afford  us  access  to  whole  ranges  of  experience 
beyond our own” (Friedman  1993:  197).

This  learning process  requires,  obviously, that friends are willing to  share concerns  and 
to  listen,  that  they  are  open  for  learning  and  moral  growth.  It  is  also  here,  in  the 
provision  of  satisfying  desires  for  belonging/recognition  and  in  mutually  providing 
stimuli and energy for common projects where friends relate as equals and contribute on 
a  unique  logic  of reciprocity.  In  this  sense,  commitment  to  ‘world  building’  is  also  a 
commitment to ‘burden sharing’, although not one that rests on a quantifiable division of 
labor.  Empowerment understood  as  a  transformative  process  implies  that  friends  must 
not  only  “respect  and  take  an  interest  in  one  another’s  perspectives”  (Friedman  1993: 
189) but are also willing to adapt (and  recognize the  benefits from doing so).  For states 
conceived  as  national  biographies this  implies the willingness to  adapt domestic orders 
and  the  narratives which  uphold them, which  echoes James  Rosenau’s  notion  of states 
as  “adaptive  entities”  constantly  changing 
to  stimuli  from  “salient 
environments”  (Rosenau  1981).  To  be  sure,  this  does  not  rule  out  the  possibility  that 
disagreements arise over how to read  ‘the world’, what matters  is that compromises are 
made  not  in  response  to  coercion  but  voluntarily,  arrived  at  through  deliberations 
characterized  by  respect  for  occasional  divergence  of  views  and  the  willingness  for 
mutual  understanding,  solidarity  and,  again,  learning  (Risse-Kappen  1995).  Friendship, 
then, does not fall into place but is an  investment, a political project.

in  response 

The  empowerment  process,  expressed  in  the  pursuit  of  a  common  project,  affects 
international  order  at  large.  Overlapping  experienced  spaces  are  likely  to  be  shared 
with/inhabited by others and so the world built by friends is not that intimate, which is to 
say that the  ‘in-between’  in  friendship relations  is not an  exclusive space.  By providing 
each  other with  ‘voice’,  the  agenda  pursued  by  friends  also  weighs  in  interaction  with 
third  parties  and  is  likely to  affect them.  The  application  of a  double  standard  may  not 
merely exclude  ‘third parties’  from decisions and  leave them  in the dark about the  ‘real’ 
reasons for doing X  or Y,267 the decisions taken  may be very well  directed against third 
parties.  Hence,  the  finding  by  philosophers  and  sociologists  that  friendship  affects

267 As  Goffiman puts  it “the self that is revealed in our dealings with our friends  is closer to our 
self definition  than  the  ‘self  we  portray  in  other  contexts...friends  are  permitted  ‘backstage’ 
more than most” (in Allan  1989: 59).

163

society (Hutter  1978;  Allan  1989) can  be applied to the  international  level and  supports 
Biially  Mattem’s  suggestion  that  special  relationships  are  sources  of international  order 
(Bially Mattem 2005a).

Institutions as Platforms for Negotiating World-Building

As  noted  earlier,  friendship  among  ‘states’  as  an  evolving  relationship  is  about 
negotiating  a  shared  project  across  formal  state  boundaries,  about  entwining  national 
biographies in a shared space. This negotiation is done by governments (‘heads of state’) 
who  have  been  given  the  mandate  from,  and  are  held  accountable  by,  their  domestic 
constituency  to  ‘represent’,  administer  and  protect/enhance  the  national  biography  and 
negotiate  it  with  government  representatives  of the  friend-state.  Thus,  the  negotiation 
process takes place  in a  ‘two  level game’268 where  institutions play a crucial  role.  In the 
domestic  setting  institutions  vary  with  the  political  system,  and  in  most  societies  they 
encompass  a  complex  setting  in  which  political  parties,  parliament,  courts,  the  media, 
and other public and private  sector groups debate the national biography on the basis of 
a  formal  constitution.  While these  ‘domestic’  institutions  may also  organize themselves 
across  formal  borders,  thus  thickening  the  transnational  space  on  the  level  ‘below’  the 
government,  focus  here  is  on  how  government  representatives  negotiate  the  shared 
project through formal  international  institutions.

More precisely, the argument is that states do so primarily through  international  security 
institutions.  To  be  sure,  what  is ontologically  secure, that is,  what provides the national 
biography  with  a  sense  of coherence  and  authenticity,  may  well  include  ideas  about 
economic  order.  Thus,  the  logic  of  the  causal  narrative  presented  here  does  not 
necessarily  limit  institutions  to  those  formally  in  charge  of  ‘security’.  However,  such 
institutions are explicitly devised to protect ‘the state’  and,  in the reading presented here, 
a  national  biography.  Moreover,  it  could  be  argued  that  security  institutions  are 
concerned with the use of force, and the definition of what accounts for a legitimate use 
of force, central to Weber’s definition of the state, is a key element of ideas of the ‘good’ 
order inscribed  in national biographies.  Even in that case, security institutions,  including 
those  often  described  as  military  alliances  such  as  NATO,  are  understood  here  as 
political  platforms  through  which  the  very  meaning  of  ‘security’  for  the  Self and  its

268 Or what Harald  Mueller (2004) has called a “two-level discourse”,  although 1 shy away from 
using  the  term  ‘discourse’  to  avoid  the  impression  that  shared  world  building  is  a  purely 
rhetorical exercise.

164

world  is  established,  that  is,  agreed  upon  with  friends.  As  such,  the  function  of 
institutions  is  different  from  the  realist  reading  of stabilizing  a  certain  distribution  of 
economic/military ‘power’, and from the institutionalist reading of mediating anarchy by 
providing reliable information for members with pre-existing common interests.  Instead, 
institutions  are  seen  here  as  platforms for creating  a  common  understanding  of ‘being- 
in-the-world’,  used  by  friends  to  negotiate,  administer,  and  manifest  the  common 
project. They are, in short, vehicles for shared  ‘world building’.269

To  a  degree,  the  purpose  of  international  institutions  to  facilitate  the  convergence  of 
horizons  of experience  and  expectations  encompasses  Krasner’s  (1983:  2)  definition  of 
institutions  as  “principles,  norms,  rules,  and  decision-making  procedures  around  which 
actor’s  expectations  converge  in  a  given  area”.  What  is  missing  from  this  definition  is 
that  institutions,  as  understood  here,  are  forums  for creating a valued  order.  While they 
also  come to  embody this order,  it  is  more  in  form  of holding  an  architectural  promise 
for creating  a  certain  moral  space.  Institutions  come  to  symbolize the  common  project 
and  are  thus  placeholders  for  the  envisioned  space  that  friends  are  unfolding  towards; 
they  are  sites  creating  the  ‘illusion’  of  an  eternal  temporal  structure  providing  the 
comfort  that  the  future  can  be  planned.  This  makes  institutions projecting  rather  than 
preserving  bodies,  platforms  for  devising  and  pursuing  shared  visions  and  for 
administering  the  potential  through  which  friends  can  carry  out  activities  towards  this 
end.  In that sense,  institutions are uncertainty-reducing structures, as friends investing in 
them  confirm 
their  commitment  to  a  shared  path,  although  without  institutions 
themselves manifesting that path.

As  inter-subjective  constructs  which  are  used  by  friends  as  platforms  for  building  a 
shared  world  institutions only possess what John  Ruggie (1998:  62) calls  “transordinate 
authority”.  Consequently,  the  relevance  of an  institution  is  dependent  on  the  vitality  of 
interstate  friendship,  which  makes  for  a  more  limited  reading  of  the  influence  of 
institutions  along  the  lines  suggested  by  Lebow  (2003:  326f.)  in  contrast  to  those 
scholars  emphasizing  their  socializing  power  (see  previous  chapter).  And  because 
intersubjectivity among friends is never total and their common project always subject to 
negotiation (and confirmation), institutions are not static but dynamic. Just as the entities 
investing in them, they unfold over time and are never complete (Wallander 2000).

269 For a discussion of institutions as structures of empowerment, see Ringmar (2007).

165

In sum, the purpose of institutions  is both  symbolic and  practical,  serving as forums for 
negotiations  and  as  a frame  for common  (expected) practices,  providing  friends  with  a 
space  for  devising  a  shared  utopia  and  enabling  them  to  confirm  their  commitment 
through  co-operation.  An  institution  through  which  this  is  achieved,  that  is,  through 
which friends can weave together their national biographies in a shared project, through 
which  a  valued  space  can  be  imagined  and  moved  towards,  satisfies  their  respective 
‘national  security  interest’. To complete the causal  narrative, the  question then  is why a 
state  would  invest  in  a  new  institution.  This  question  will  be  addressed  in  the  next 
chapter.

CHAPTER SEVEN:  PROCESSES OF ESTRANGEMENT AND 
EMANCIPATION

Summary
The  previous  chapter  argued  that  states  invest  in  common  security  institutions  for  the 
purpose  of controlling  anxiety  through  common  ‘world  building’  project  with  friends. 
More  precisely,  it  was  argued  that  friendship  understood  as  an  intimate  relationship 
allows  for  authentic  becoming  in  a  social  setting  and  that  institutions  enable  them  to 
negotiate  a  shared  narrative  of order  in  space  and  time  in  which  respective  national 
biographies  -   their  sense  of authentic  ‘being-in-the-world’  -   can  be  embedded.  This 
chapter  continues  the  argumentative  path  to  explain  why  states  would  invest  in 
new/alternative  institutions.  It  suggests  that  they  do  so  when  the  existing  institutional 
arrangement  and  the  friendship  sustained  through  it  ceases  to  function  as  an  anxiety 
controlling mechanism. More precisely,  it puts forward the argument that the decision to 
invest  in  a  new  institution  is  an  expression  of  a  weakening/deteriorating  friendship 
undergoing  a  process  of  estrangement  and  the  decision  to  strengthen  bonds  with  an 
alternative significant Other in a process of emancipation.

The argument is made  in  four steps:  First,  it explores what threatens friendship through 
the  broader  question  of  what  poses  a  threat  to  ‘identity’  manifested  in  a  social 
relationship,  attention  is  directed to ambivalence.  Second,  it is  argued that ambivalence 
arises in the figure of the stranger which enters friendship relations from within through 
a process  of friend-tuming-stranger,  or  ‘estrangement’. Third, the chapter outlines what 
characterizes  an  estrangement  process  and  points  to  some  causes  which  may  put 
friendship  onto  this  path  before,  fourth,  discussing  two  possible  strategies  for  affected 
states  of  dealing  with  such  a  process,  namely  ‘adaptation’  and  ‘emancipation’.  The 
chapter concludes with  some guiding thoughts on  what can  be  expected  when  applying 
the causal  narrative  developed thus  far to the  empirical  study of the  German-American 
relationship.

Conceptualising the ‘Existential Threat’
The  intuitive answer to the question why a state would invest in a new institution  is that 
it considers the old  arrangement inadequate (or,  as utilitarians would say,  inefficient)  in 
fulfilling the function it was set up for.  In the theoretical frame developed here,  it means 
the institution  has become  inadequate  in providing  ‘ontological  security’  in the sense of 
enabling the Self to construct and ‘live’ (formulate and practice) a coherent biographical

narrative  inscribing meaning into time and space through a project devised with friends. 
Given  the  close  link  made  in  the  causal  narrative  between  costly  investment  in  an 
institution  and  the  maintenance  of  friendship,  an  exploration  of  what  renders  an 
institution 
look  at  what 
undermines/weakens friendship.  Said  differently,  to  understand  what makes an  existing 
institutional arrangement inadequate requires a better understanding of what generates a 
feeling  of ontological  insecurity,  that  is,  what  poses  an  ‘existential  threat’  to  a  stable 
sense of Self generated within friendship. The task is thus to think more carefully about 
what  possesses  the  potential  to  destabilize  the  narrative  of  ‘authentic  becoming’ 
generated with a significant Other and to give some clues where ‘it’  comes from.

requires 

taking  a  closer 

Although  there  are  some  useful  hints,  IR  scholarship  fares  poorly  when  it  comes  to 
conceptualizing  the  threat  to  socially  constructed  ‘identities’  and  specifying  how  it 
emerges  among  states.  The  initial  group  of  moderate  constructivists  dealt  with  the 
‘existential  threat’  in  two  ways,  both  of which  end  up  with  an  argument where  such  a 
threat  has  disappeared.  The  first  does  so  deliberately  and  is  most  apparent  in  Wendt’s 
work.  In his progressive narrative of states moving towards a Kantian world the  ‘threat’ 
(along with  ‘power’,  tellingly) gradually disappears.  When  states  move  away  from  that 
Hobbesian  ‘state of nature’  in which relations are characterized by a fear of war towards 
a  world  in  which  relations  are  peaceful  and  trusting,  threats  are  socialized  away 
accordingly.270

The second reason for why the existential threat drops out of the causal narrative among 
moderate  constructivists  is  a  logical  mistake  found  in  the  discussion  by  Adler/Barnett 
and  Cronin.  Like  Wendt’s  Kantian  cultures,  security  communities  are  marked  by 
expectations  of peaceful  co-existence  amongst  its  members;  yet  in  contrast  to  Wendt 
these  works  also  rely  an  ‘ingroup’  versus  ‘outgroup’  dynamic  to  explain  how  states 
come  to  share  a  collective  identity.  In  this  context,  they  cannot  avoid  noting  that 
understandings of peaceful  coexistence shared within the community may not be shared 
with  those  situated  outside  and,  thus,  may  involve  conceiving  of  non-members  as 
enemies.  While this  is safely rooted  in  Social  Identity Theory, the  logical  mistake arises 
in conceptualising these outsiders/others as a threat to  identity (Adler and Barnett  1998: 
56,  also  Cronin  1999:  141).  As  noted  in  the  previous  chapter  and  further  below,  the 
labelling of the excluded ‘Other’  as a ‘threat’  or ‘enemy’  is a political act to stabilise the

270  Again,  this  shows  that  Wendt  has  not  gone  beyond  realist  ontology  when  it  comes  to 
conceptualising what  constitutes  an existential threat.  He  only mentions  in passing the “psychic 
threat of not having standing” (Wendt 1999: 237).

immoral  and 

Two  recent  works  exploring  the  socio-linguistic  ties  of the  Anglo-American  ‘special 
relationship’  by Steele (2005) and Bially Mattem (2005b) offer some promising hints for 
conceptualising  ontological  insecurity.  Steele  looks  at  the  British  decision  not  to 
intervene  in  the  American  Civil  War,  which  he  attributes  to  Lincoln’s  Emancipation 
Proclamation framing the war as one being fought over the  issue of slavery.  This would 
have made an intervention in support of the South inconsistent with the view that slavery 
was 
thus,  according  to  Steele,  would  have  undermined  Britain’s 
biographical  narrative.  In  short,  the  decision  not to  intervene was thus  made to  avert a 
threat  to  British  ontological  security  (Steele  2005:  523,  538).  Whereas  Steele  provides 
little  conceptual  guidance  on  the  phenomenon  of ontologically  insecurity  and  does  not 
embed  it  in  a  social  ontology,  Bially  Mattem’s  discussion  of the temporary breakdown 
of the  special  relationship  between  London  and  Washington  in  the  1956  ‘Suez  crisis’ 
goes  one  step  further.  To  explain  why  the  Anglo-American  friendship  was  eventually 
repaired, she suggests that ‘national  identity’  was threatened  by normative inconsistency 
produced  by  the  breakdown  of the  special  relationship.  According  to  Mattem,  mutual 
accusations of violating shared values/norms fundamental to the Western order in which 
American  and  British  narratives  of  national  Selfhood  were  embedded  generated 
“episteifiological  disorder” and, thus, threatened ontological  security on  both  sides.  And 
so “to prevent their very existence from cascading away” political  leaders in London and 
Washington  decided  to  re-produce  ‘Anglo-American  we-ness’  (Bially  Mattem  2005b: 
57, 79,  121  and Ch. 7; see also Risse-Kappen  1995).

Although both analyses fall short of providing a substantial theoretical argument for this 
process,  what  emerges  is  the  suggestion  that  national  biographies  are  threatened  by 
normative  inconstancy/incoherence  and  that  its  emergence  is  somehow  linked  to 
‘discord’  in  a special  relationship.  Part of the task of adapting this  insight to the present 
theoretical  argument  is to  conceptually  substantiate what  kind  of ‘discord’  is  posing an 
existential  threat,  and  why.  Then  there  is the  question  when  it occurs.  Steele  speaks  of 
‘critical situations’  when “states must make a decision about who they are” (Steele 2005: 
537) and Bially Mattem of ‘crises’  as “moments during which statesmen...come to view 
[an]  event  as  so  divisive  that  it  demands  a  complete  reassessment  of the  status  quo 
relationship” (Bially Mattem 2005b:  57).  While they have little to say about what makes 
certain  situations  ‘critical’  or  why  some  moments  turn  into  a  ‘crisis’,  both  authors 
suggest that ontological  insecurity emerges in the context of wars/violent conflicts, more

169

precisely  in the  act of interpreting  such  conflicts  and  integrating them  into the  meaning 
structure and of being-in-the-world.

The following takes up these hints to conceptualize the threat to/weakening of friendship 
and,  correspondingly, the  investment in  a new  institution,  in accordance with the causal 
narrative  presented  so  far.  The  guiding  thought  is  that,  having  argued  that  ‘authentic 
becoming’  is  established  on  the  social  level, the threat to the same must emerge from  a 
loss of these social bonds into which the biographical narrative is embedded.271

Difference?
It is  useful  to  start by addressing the  prominent misconception that authentic  becoming 
is  threatened  by  ‘the  enemy’,  touched  upon  earlier,  and  the  more  fundamental  but 
equally  problematic  notion  of  ‘difference’.  One  prominent  source  of this  mistake  is 
Connolly’s  discussion  of  ‘the  Other’  touched  upon  in  the  previous  chapter.  For 
Connolly,  the  identification  of evil  and  its  synonyms,  such  as  the  enemy,  is  a  political 
act  to  ‘fix’  difference,  and  this  act  of fixation  is  done  because  difference  is  seen  as  a 
threat  to  the  attempt  to  establish  a  ‘true’  identity  (Connolly,  1991:  71).  According  to 
Connolly  ‘difference’  is  perceived  as  threatening  for  those  seeking  a  ‘true’  identity 
because  it  suggests  that  the  ‘ultimate’  answer  to  what  is,  or  can  be,  is  not  possible. 
Hence, “the threat is posed not merely by actions the other might take to  injure or defeat 
the  true  identity  but  by  the  very  visibility  o f its  mode  o f being  as  other”  (Ibid.,  66, 
emphasis added).  This view  is echoed  by Campbell who notes that the existence of “an 
alternative  mode  of  being”  denaturalizes  the  claim  of  a  particular  identity  to  be  the 
“true”  identity  (Campbell,  1998:  3).  Hence,  to  “secure  identity  in  its  truth”  and  keep 
difference  at  bay,  everything that  appears  ‘different’  is  fixed  as  the  enemy  ‘Other’  and 
degraded to  an  inferior status.  Through  this  act of fixation  the  (perceived) threat to the 
Self disappears, which means the portrayal of the Other as ‘enemy’ (or evil) functions as 
a stabilizer of conceptions of Self (see also chapter six).

That  said,  Connolly  sows  confusion  through  his  suggestion  that  the  threat  to  the  Self 
comes  from  ‘difference’.  This  sits  uneasily  with  his  portrayal  of the  fixed  and  non­
threatening  Self-Other relationship  for two reasons.  First,  his  suggestion that the  Self is 
capable of recognising difference, that the visibility of ‘being other’  can be grasped as a

271  Here  my  argument  further  inverses  Heidegger’s  logic.  While  Heidegger  does  not  explicitly 
address the issue of the existential threat, as discussed  in  chapter four he does offer a conception 
of what threatens  ‘authentic  being’,  namely  the  process  (the  temptation)  of  Verfalien  (although 
the irony  is, of course, that the  Self does not ‘know’  this threat).  This theme is visible especially 
in his later writings on the impact of technology (Dreyfus, 2006:  361).

170

possibility  implies  that  this  ‘other  mode  of  being’  already  is  part  of  the  meaning 
structure the Self ‘knows’  and, hence, moves within the horizons it understands.  Such an 
understanding of the  possibility of a different  ‘mode of existence’  is not a destabilizing 
experience. The reasoning applied here is similar to the one behind the argument that an 
apocalyptic  scenario  of the  future,  a dystopia,  does  not  pose  an  existential  threat to the 
Self.  As  discussed  in  chapter  five,  any  substantial  vision  of the  future  is  a  projection 
providing  the  Self with  a  meaningful  reference  and  serving  as  an  anxiety  controlling 
mechanism.  Rather than  facing  ‘nothing’  the  Self sees  ‘something’  unpleasant coming, 
which  provides  a  sense  of  direction  and  purpose  in  the  determination  to  avert  the 
scenario  from  becoming  ‘reality’.  And  this  something  must  be  ‘known’,  must  be 
considered  possible.  Just  like  dystopias  can  only  be  imagined  by  drawing  on  past 
experience, so difference can only be recognized if it is already part of the world the Self 
has disclosed.

Second, locating the threat to the Self prior to the act of ‘fixation’  is difficult to reconcile 
logically  with  the  view  that  a  stable  sense  of Self is  socially  generated,  that  is,  in  a 
relationship.  For  there  to  be  a  conceivable  ‘threat’,  the  Self  must  be  in  a  state  of 
ontological  security  and,  hence,  must  already  have  identified  its  ‘Other’,  which  in 
Connolly’s version  is the  ‘enemy’. The  threat must come after the act of ‘fixation’  and, 
if we  follow  Connolly’s  logic,  from  disappearance  of  ‘the  enemy’.  Ronnie  Lipschutz 
(1995:  217) captures this  in a well-known anecdote about a Soviet diplomat noting to an 
American  colleague  in  the  final  days  of the  Cold  War:  “We  are  about  to  do  a  terrible 
thing  to  you.  We  are  going  to  deprive  you  of  an  enemy”.  Adapted  to  the  present 
argument, which takes friendship rather than enmity as the social  relationship in which a 
stable  sense  of  ‘being’  is  obtained,  the  threat  emerges  in  the  ‘disappearance’  of the 
friend.  Before  engaging this,  it  is  necessary  to  clarity  what  happens  in  this  process  by 
taking  a  closer  look  at  the  condition  which  the  Self,  striving  for  authentic  becoming, 
fears.

Ambivalence!
The argument pursued here follows Jef Huysmans (1998a:  241), who relies on Zygmunt 
Baumann  to  argue  that  the  nature  of  the  destabilising  experience  which  generates 
ontological  insecurity  is  best captured  in  the  notion  o f ‘ambivalence’  (Baumann  1991). 
Broadly 
of 
opposed/conflicting feelings, thoughts and desires and,  thus,  a  ,tom ’  or confused’  being 
unable to make a choice.  A  Self which finds  itself in a state of ambivalence is uncertain 
about how to  evaluate  its  world  and  which  direction  it should  take.  As  Baumann  put  it,

simultaneous 

ambivalence 

coexistence 

speaking, 

describes 

the 

171

in a state of ambivalence the Self is “unable to read the situation properly” which creates 
a  feeling  of “acute  discomfort”  (Baumann,  1991:  1).  Although  it  is  not quite  a  state  of 
meaninglessness  but of a conflict  of meanings,  it  is  a  state  of disorientation  and  thus  a 
state  heightening the  mood  of anxiety.  This  becomes  clear  in  Baumann’s  discussion  of 
ambivalence  as juxtaposed  to  order.272  Whereas  order  enables  the  Self to  comfortably 
place things  into familiar categories, ambivalence is characterized by “the possibility of 
assigning  an  object  or  an  event  to  more  than  one  category”  and  therefore  “disorder” 
(Baumann  1991:  1).  For order-seeking individuals,  a state  of ambivalence  signifies  ‘the 
other’  of order,  “the  indeterminate  and  unpredictable”  and,  thus,  generates  a  feeling  of 
uncertainty  “that  source  and  archetype  of  all  fear”  (Ibid.,  7).  The  significance  of 
ambivalence  hence  is  the  ‘emptiness’  of  the  future,  the  difficulty  to  ‘read’  it  as  a 
meaningful  place,  and  the  negative  emotional  impact this  has  on  the  Self.  In  a  section 
entitled  ‘The  horror  of  indetermination’,  Baumann  argues  that  this  uncertainty  about 
where  to  go  is  not only  confusing and  discomforting  but  “it carries  a  sense  of danger” 
(Ibid.,  56).

The threat posed to the Self by ambivalence is that it is destabilizing and thereby creates 
an  ‘identity  crisis’,  a  concept  introduced  in  the  1950s  by  Erik  Erikson  to  capture 
individuals  suffering  from  acute  problems  of orientation.  While  Erikson  developed  the 
notion of an  identity crisis to describe crises of adolescence, it has since been used more 
generally  to  describe  a  Self suffering  from  “massive  dislocations”  (Straub,  2002:  62), 
“an  acute  form  of  disorientation”  (Taylor,  1989:  27).  For  a  Self  gaining  orientation 
primarily by being placed in a valued space, a “radical uncertainty” about where to stand 
signifies  a  moral  uncertainty.  As  Taylor  phrases  it,  Selves  suffering  from  an  identity 
crisis

“lack  a  frame  or  horizon  within  which  things  can  take  on  a  stable 
significance,  within which  some  life possibilities can  be  seen as  good  or 
meaningful, others as bad or trivial. The meaning of all these possibilities 
is  unfixed,  labile,  or  undetermined.  This  is  a  painful  and  frightening 
experience” (Taylor  1989: 27f).

In  other  words,  ambivalence  means  a  blurring,  if not  loss,  of the  meaning  structures 
through which the  Self discloses the world.  Having the world  stripped  of its familiarity 
is an experience of instable foundations, if not loss of ground, and thus uncertainty about 
where to stand. The  lack of orientation is threatening to the  Self because it faces a world

272  It  is not difficult to see the Heideggerian  lines in  Baumann’s reasoning,  with the neutralizing 
force  of the  everyday  as  a totality (modernity/order)  which  nevertheless  contains the  possibility 
of the ‘dreadful’  (ambivalence).

it  does  not  ‘know’  or  understand,  generating  what  Huysmans  calls  ‘epistemological 
fear”  (Huysmans,  1998a:  235).  In this  sense, the  Selfs ontological  insecurity  is  brought 
about by epistemological  insecurity. Applied to the terminology used here, ambivalence 
is  a  ‘frightening  experience’  because  it  brings  about  incoherence  into  the  biographical 
narrative,  a  loss  of centre  or feeling to  be  at  ‘home’.  More  precisely,  as the  centre  is  a 
duality consisting of meaningful  places  in the past and the  future,  it moves these places 
out of foqus,  captured  in  Baumann’s note that ambivalence turns the world  into a  ‘grey 
area’.  In  such  a world,  the value  attributed  to  the  order the  Self has  disclosed  is  called 
into  question  and  horizons  of  experience  and  expectations  are  disconnected.  As  the 
vision pursued cannot be satisfactorily placed inside the memory space anymore,  lessons 
learned  don’t  appear  to  translate  into  a  meaningful  project,  making  it  difficult  if  not 
impossible  to  simultaneously  unfold  out  of and  into  a  known  ‘world’.  Instead  of being 
able  to  formulate  a  coherent  national  biography  the  Self  faces  “temporal  and  spatial 
diffusion” (Straub 2002: 61).

In one way, the destabilizing experience brought about by ambivalence is  similar to the 
‘shock’  discussed  in chapter five in that both shake the meaning structure of ‘the world’ 
the  Self has  disclosed  for  itself and  trigger a heightened  feeling of anxiety.  Apart from 
that  the  two  are  very  different.  The  shock  is  an  extreme  version  of  a  significant 
experience which creates a memory space and is given meaning together with the friend, 
thus  coming to  serve  as  a  source  of order  integrated  into the  national  biography.  After 
rupturing  ‘the world’  it takes on a stabilizing function  by manifesting a past and certain 
‘lessons’  which  friends  can  agree  on  and  use  for  their  project.  By  contrast,  the 
ambivalence leading to an  identity crisis, while  it may become visible and crystallize  in 
one  moment,  gradually  undermines  the  coherence  of  the  biographical  narrative  and 
weakens  the  Selfs  ability  to  generate  stable  meaning  structures  with  the  friend.  The 
difference  will  become  clearer  when  taking  a  closer  look  at  how/where  ‘ambivalence’ 
enters ‘being-in-the-world’.

Introducing ‘The Stranger’
For Baumann,  ambivalence  is an  inevitably side product of modernity (Baumann  1991: 
15;  also Huysmans  1998a). Adopting Horkheimer and Adorno’s diagnosis of a dialectic 
of enlightenment, he suggests that ambivalence may appear as a disturbance to order but 
actually  falls  within  the  logic  of creating order.  In the  process  of (trying to)  categorize 
things into a coherent whole, or what Baumann calls a ‘dream of purity’, there is always 
something  which  does  not  fit  and  remains  ‘outside’.  Ambivalence  thus  is  the  very 
consequence  of  boundary  drawing,  more  precisely  a  result  of the  fact  that  boundary

173

drawing  is  “never  foolproof’  (Ibid.:  57).  Hence,  Baumann  argues,  ambivalence cannot 
be  eradicated,  its  appearance  is  unavoidable  and  thus  a “normal  condition”,  creating an 
“ambient fear” (Baumann,  1997:  22). This dialectic  is a bit too static because it assumes 
a  fixed  and  rigid  sense  of order  and  the  desire  for  a  totalizing  closure,  whereas  the 
argument presented  here emphasizes a dynamic of ‘world  building’, a creative and open 
process through  a malleable  memory  space  and  a  ‘limited utopia’.  That  said,  Baumann 
makes  gives a crucial  hint  in  locating the  emergence of ambivalence  in  the  appearance 
of a ‘stranger’.

Except  for  a  mentioning  by  Huysmans,  the  category  of  ‘the  stranger’  is  by  and  large 
absent  from  the  IR  literature  and  remains  under-conceptualized  even  among  social 
theorists. Those who discuss the phenomenon describe the stranger as, broadly speaking, 
presenting  a  “limit-experience  for  humans  trying  to  identify  themselves”  (Kearney, 
2003:  3).  Beyond that, there  is no clear definition  of what makes a  ‘stranger’  other than 
that  it  represents  the  ‘unknown’  (the  German  term Jremd  means  both  ‘strange’  and 
‘foreign’).  For  Richard  Kearny the  figure of the  stranger is  pretty  much everything that 
is  ‘uncanny’  and  ranges  from  the  ancient  notion  of  ‘foreigner’  to  the  contemporary 
category of ‘alien’,  in a chapter entitled  ‘Strangers and Scapegoats’  he tellingly does not 
really discuss the concept of the stranger (Kearny 2003: ch.  1).

The  earliest  discussion  in  sociology,  which  remains  quite  influential,  is  presented  by 
Georg  Simmel.  For  Simmel  the  stranger  emerges  in  the  image  of  “the  potential 
wanderer”  who  “has  not  quite  overcome  the  freedom  of coming  and  going”  (Simmel, 
1950  [1908]:  402).  It  is  a  person  who  simultaneously  is  and  is  not  part  of a  ‘familiar 
setting’,  whose  position  within  a  group  is  “determined...by  the  fact  that  he  has  not 
belonged  to  it  from  the  beginning,  that  he  imports  qualities  into  it  which  do  not  and 
cannot  stem  from  the  group  itself’ (Ibid.).  The  unique  feature  of the  stranger  is that “it 
embodies that  synthesis  of nearness  and  distance”  and  is  thus  someone who  is  in  close 
contact but not “organically connected” (Ibid, 404).  In spatial terms, while present in the 
sense that it cannot be ignored the stranger cannot be placed by the Self within its frames 
of experience and expectations;  it appears quite literally  ‘out of place’.  One can develop 
two  slightly  different  conceptualizations  of the  stranger  out  of  Simmel’s  discussion, 
namely the  ‘newcomer’  and the  ‘marginal’  (Mclemore,  1970).  It is  easy to  see  how the 
two  may be  conflated  in  that the  newcomer is  marginalized by  society  because  it  does 
not ‘fit’, yet for the present purpose they must be kept apart. The reading of the stranger 
as  ‘the  marginal’  moves  the  analytical  focus  towards  a  study  of  discrimination  as  a

174

reaction  to  the  appearance  of the  strange;  the  present  task,  instead,  is  to  discern  the 
threatening potential of the ‘wanderer’.

Whereas  Simmel  sees the  stranger as  a peculiar but not  necessarily problematic feature 
of  society,  Baumann  points  out  that  the  stranger  is  perceived  as  a  threat  to  the  Self 
striving for order by  introducing ambivalence and  interrupting familiarity.  He  describes 
the destabilizing atmosphere surrounding the appearance of the stranger is stark colours: 
“the arrival of a Stranger has the impact of an earthquake.. .the Stranger shatters the rock 
on which the  security of daily  life rests” (Baumann  1991  or  1997:  10).  Baumann  nicely 
captures the difference between the enemy and the stranger and makes clear that it is the 
latter which poses the ‘existential threat’ to the Self:

“The threat he  [the stranger]  carries  is  more horrifying than that which  one  can 
fear  from  the  enemy.  The  stranger  threatens  the  sociation  itself -   the  very 
possibility  o f sociation  (...)  And  this  because  the  stranger  is  neither  friend  not 
enemy; and  because  he may be both (...) The  stranger is one (perhaps the  main 
one,  the  archetypal  one)  member  of the  familiy  of  ‘undecidables’”  (Baumann 
1997:  55, emphasis added).

In  other words,  the  stranger  is feared  because  it defies  sociability.  It does  not allow the 
Self to connect/establish bonds and appears to ‘empty’ the in-between space of meaning, 
thus  standing  for  the  fallibility  of ‘the  world’.  It  introduces  the  grey  areas,  a  world  of 
ambivalence,  and  thus  the  ‘horror  of indetermination’  discussed  above.  This  overlaps 
with  Kearny’s  description  of strangers  as  triggering  an  ‘uncanny’  experience  and  with 
Julia  Kristeva’s  notion  of  the  ‘horrific  sublime’  experience  when  encountering  the 
‘abject’  (Kearney 2003:  73ff.,  89ff). And it is echoed by Baumann who suggests that for 
a Self seeking stability “it is best not to meet strangers at all” (Baumann  1997:  62).273

If the threat to a stable sense of Self is associated with the figure of the stranger, where 
does  the  stranger  come  from?  Given  that  it  is  difficult  to  conceive  of  ‘states’  as 
wandering around, where/how does  it emerge? For Simmel and  Baumann the stranger is 
an  ‘Other’  being  which  cannot  be  understood  but  is  present  in  ‘the  world’.  Taking  up 
this  hint  and  thinking  about  where,  most  likely,  in  ‘the  world’  comes  from,  this  thesis 
shifts  the  conception  of  the  stranger  away  from  the  notion  that  it  enters  from  the 
‘outside’.  Furthermore,  it  is  useful  to  differentiate  the  conception  of  the  stranger

273  Baumann  echoes  Connolly to  some  extent  when  arguing  that “the  national  state  is  designed 
primarily to deal with the problem of strangers, not enemies” by “keeping the stranger at a mental 
distance through  ‘locking him up’  in  a shell of exoticism” to  assert an  actual  identity (Baumann 
1991: 63-67).

introduced  here  from  what might be  called the  ‘familiar stranger’,  which  is not entirely 
‘unknown’  to the  extent that  it  has  a recognizable  place  in  the  experienced  space  but  it 
remains at a distance to the centre, that is,  it is disconnected  from the  soul.  Whereas the 
familiar stranger is  a  being the  Self does  not  feel  emotionally  close to,  the  argument  is 
that in order to pose a threat to ontological security, ‘the stranger’  lacks this distance.

Emotional proximity is what the stranger has in common with the friend. Hence, picking 
up  Simmel’s note that the phenomenon of “strangeness”  enters “even the  most intimate 
relationships” (Simmel  1950:  406) the argument put forward here  is that ‘the stranger’ -  
the  figure turning  being  in  the  world  ‘ambivalent’  -  emerges  from  within  friendship. 
Indeed,  it can  be  argued  that the  notion  of the  stranger (or  ‘strangeness’)  as  something 
that  poses  an  existential  threat  must  appear  from  within  friendship  because  of  the 
vulnerability  of intimacy.  To  see this  we  must recall  that the  identification  of what can 
pose  an  ‘existential  threat’  is  logically  linked to  an  understanding of the  vulnerabilities 
of that which sustains the Self. If friendship is crucial in sustaining a stable sense of Self, 
in  what  sense  is  it  vulnerable  and  who  is  in  the  position  to  exploit  this  vulnerability? 
Again, the answers are easy to see.  Strengthening of friendship bonds inversely creates a 
relationship of interdependence:  by  empowering each  other  in  pursuing a project which 
lends coherence to and  entwines their national  biographies,  friends also come to depend 
on each other for sustaining the same.

side,  namely 
vulnerability.274  In  the  process  of developing  ideas  of order  /  a  shared  a  moral  space 
together by collaborating on making sense of the past and planning for the future, friends 
tame  their  anxiety  by  coming  to  share  intimate  knowledge,  and  this  intimacy  implies 
great vulnerability.  The trust that friends will  continue to  invest in the  common project 
and,  thereby,  will  continue  making  the  world  meaningful  for  each  other,  makes  the

‘sensitivity’  and  ‘vulnerability’, the first referring to the degree to which A  is affected  if B shifts 
its  policy  in  a  specific  issue  area  (such  as  oil  production),  and  the  second  referring  to  A’s 
(in)ability  to  switch  to  an  alternative  source  (such  as  nuclear  energy).  They  suggested  that

Self  as  the  friend,  no-one  is  as  powerful  to  undermine  it.  As  Horst  Hutter  in  his 
comprehensive discussion of The Politics o f Friendship  puts  it:  “there  is no  one who  is 
as vulnerable to the actions of Self as a friend (...) no power is as total as the power one 
has over friends” (Hutter,  1978:  12).

The  dialectic  relationship  of  empowerment  producing  vulnerability  underscores  the 
conceptualization of the unfolding Self as one which never completely  ‘owns’  its world. 
The  possibility  of  the  friend-tuming-stranger  and,  hence,  the  inherent  ability  of  the 
friend  to  significantly  destabilize the national  biography  is  always  ‘present’,  so  that the 
feeling of a  loss of identity  is “a threat against which no one can  be completely  secure” 
(Straub 2002:  62).275 And  if the friend plays a key role  in enabling authentic becoming, 
then  its  ‘disappearance’,  the  process  of the  friend  turning  into  a  stranger,  poses  the 
greatest threat to  the  same.  This  process  of estrangement,  its  character  and  causes,  and 
the strategies available to the Self for dealing with it must be looked at in more detail.

friends agree  in the possibilities projected  into the future and trust each other to commit 
to  ‘realizing’  a  shared  vision.  Friends  invest  in  this  process  of shared  world  building 
according to  a unique  logic  of reciprocity  and  regard  each  other as  equals.  Conversely, 
estrangement  is  characterised  by  disagreements  over  what  the  project  entails  and  by

The  stranger brings  ambivalence  into the world,  and  so the threat of estrangement does 
not  lie  in  an  absence  of  ordering  narratives  among  friends  but,  rather,  in  their 
incompatibility  and,  consequently,  in  the  absence  of a shared narrative.  Estrangement 
creates  an  ambivalent atmosphere  because  friends don’t  ‘understand’  each  other,  which 
turns the  world  they were  building  into  something unexpectedly  fragile.  The  use  of the

monsters and aliens located ‘outside’ (Kearney, 2003: 35, 72ff).

term  ‘unexpectedly’  here is deliberate to suggest that, given the fundamental  importance 
of  friendship  in  stabilising  the  sense  of  Self,  friends  have  a  common  interest  in

their  bonds,  which  means 

How,  then,  can  friends  become  strangers?  For  useful  pointers  to  what  might  cause 
estrangement  we  shall  return  to  Aristotle.276  His  discussion  of  problems  arising  in 
friendship  mainly  concerns  friendships  of utility  and  pleasure,  which  are  expected  to 
dissolve  “whenever they  are  no  longer pleasant  or  useful”  (Aristotle,  NE  Book  IX,  3). 
According to Aristotle,  true friendship is characterized by stability because the virtue on 
which  it is based  is stable: “friendship of virtue is enduring and  immune to slander” (NE 
Book  VIII,  7,  8).  However,  Aristotle  discusses  those  three  types  of friendship  as  ideal 
types  which  do  not  exist  in  isolation  in  ‘real  life’.  In  other  words,  true  friendship 
encompasses the  other two  and/or  may at times  be  difficult to tell  apart.277  Hence,  true 
friendship  is  not  devoid  of ‘utilitarianism’.  Aristotle  writes  that  “if friends  come  to  be 
separated  by  some  wide  gap  in  virtue,  vice,  wealth,  or  something  else...then  they  are 
friends no more, and do not even expect to be” (NE, Book VIII, 7). There is a difference 
between  the  effect  of  an  emerging  gap  in  ‘virtue’  (NE,  Book  IX,  3)  and  a  shift  in 
wealth/material  assets  (NE,  Book  VIII,  14).  While  Aristotle  is  not  clear  as  to  how  the 
two are related, the first is the more fundamental one, as gaps in formal  inequality can be 
compensated by agreement on the desirable good, not the other way around.

As  noted  in  the  previous  chapter,  friendship  is  never  unconditional  in  the  sense  that 
something  is  always  expected  in  return  (Smith  Pangle,  2003:  138f).  And  just  as  the 
unique logic of reciprocity cannot be made intelligible from the  ‘outside’, friends do not 
follow a formal  objective  code  of conduct and  so  by  trusting that  each  side  contributes 
‘what  is  possible’  friends  do not understand the  logic of reciprocity themselves. And  so 
it  is  well  worth  taking  seriously  Aristotle’s  warning  that  significant  shifts  in  formal 
status  and  resources/assets  available  changes  conceptions  of  what/how  much  can  be 
contributed,  which  in  turn  may  lead  to  a  corruption  of  reciprocity  (NE,  Book  VIII,

276 For a comprehensive discussion of sociological studies on the dissolution of friendship which 
is rather indeterminate because it discusses all kinds of factors, see Fehr (1996:  178ff).
277 “Friendship for pleasure bears some resemblance to this complete sort,  since good people are 
also pleasant to each  other.  And friendship of utility also resembles it, since good people are also 
useful to each other” (NE, Book VIII, 4).

14).278  Yet in the end, serious disputes over adequate contributions to the shared project 
must be taken a symptom for disagreement over the good  life, that is, a dissonance over 
ideas  o f  order.  The  notion  of  dissonance  over  ideas  of  order  is  similar  to  what 
Rratochwil  has termed a “norm  collision”  (Kratochwil,  2000;  see  also  Cardenas,  2004; 
Wiener  2004),  although  from  an  evolutionary  perspective  ‘collision’  is  a  misleading 
term  because  it  suggests  a  one-off  ‘cut’  or  ‘clash’  of  views  rather  than  gradual 
divergence.

Dissonance  may  occur  if there  is  a  misunderstanding  between  A  and  B  regarding  the 
terms of their friendship; as Aristotle puts it “friends are most at odds when they are not 
friends  in  the  way  they  think  they  are”  (NE,  Book  IX,  3).  As  noted  in  the  previous 
chapter,  despite  their  entwined  national  biographies  friends  never  completely  ‘know’ 
each other.  In a sense, because friends meet in the project, they necessarily  identify with 
an  image  of  the  Other.  Simmel  argued  that  even  if  one  can  never  know  the  other 
absolutely,  “one  forms  some  personal  unity  out  of those  fragments  in  which  alone  [the 
other]  is  accessible  to  us”  (Simmel  1950:  308,  326).  This  overlaps  with  Arendt’s  note 
that  prejudice  \VorurteiI\  is  a  necessary  element  of social  life  to  compensate  for  the 
impossibility  of sharing every experience (Arendt 2003:  13-27).  Yet  it  is  important that 
“the  picture  of  each  in  the  other”  built  in  the  relationship  “interacts  with  the  actual 
relation” (Simmel,  1950:  309).  In other words,  as noted by Aristotle, the  image must be 
affirmed through common activity  in  pursuit of,  and through costly  investment into, the 
common  project,  showing  consistency  between  stated  values  and  action  (also  Mattem 
2005).279

A  relationship which  is entirely built on  images, designed so the Other fits  into a shared 
‘world’,  is poised to encounter problems if these are not frequently adapted.  In that case, 
friends’  understanding of each  other may turn  into  a hollow prejudice where  both  sides 
believe  they  are  still  investing  in  the  same  project,  share  the  same  horizon  of

278  Telling  is  Aristotle’s  vagueness  regarding  the  possibility  of  friendship  among  formally 
unequal actors and the question of what makes an appropriate return, to which his answer ranges 
from ‘honour’ to ‘affection’ to ‘what is possible’.
279  Commitment  to  shared  world  building  does  not  form  overnight.  Peter  Blau  differentiated 
between  intrinsic  and  lasting  attraction,  the  first conceived  of as  “spontaneous  reactions  to  [the 
Other’s]  qualities”  which  lose their significance for the  Self if it becomes apparent that they are 
“calculated  to  have  a  certain  effect”  (Blau  1964:  69).  On  the  damaging  nature  of deceit,  see 
Lebow (2005).

expectations, when  in fact they do not.280  Because the future holds a prominent place  in 
the  process  of  coming  into  being-in-the-world,  dissonance  emerges  primarily  in 
diverging  utopias  -   visions  of  the  desirable  future  -   and,  hence,  in  divergence  of 
horizons  of expectations.  If A  changes,  for  whatever  reason,  its  vision  of a  desirable 
future  it alters the direction of its unfolding and consequently  its  ‘personal  maneuvering 
space’  within which the common project is pursued. This inevitably leads to a change in 
what A considers  an  appropriate contribution to the project, which will  be perceived by 
B  as  a  reduced  commitment  to  the  shared  project  as  B  knows  it.  Said  differently,  A’s 
activities,  meant to  be  investments  in  the  shared  project,  move  beyond  B’s  horizon  of 
expectations.  As a consequence, on  both sides expectations and corresponding activities 
will  not appear familiar to the friend and trigger disputes over adequate contributions to 
the shared project.281

Diverging expectations about what each can/should contributes to the shared project and 
inconsistency  between the  image A  holds  of B  and  B’s activities will  insert a  feeling of 
ambivalence  into the  process  of ‘world  building’.  To be  sure,  a  low  level  of dissonance 
is  nothing  unusual  and  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  estrangement.  What  matters  is  the 
depth and endurance of dissonance.  If dissonance  is strong and  long divergence reaches 
a critical  level and  common activities are difficult to pursue.  Ambivalence may linger in 
the background, glossed  over through vague rhetoric, yet it will  ‘hit home’  if there is an 
event which A considers an  integrative part of the world building task while B does not. 
More  precisely,  if  A  and  B  differ  about  whether/how  the  event  fits  into  the  shared 
project,  their  reactions  and  views  about  the  appropriate  response  will  differ  as  well, 
exposing the dissonance and turning ‘the world’  into an ambivalent place.

Friends  perceive  the  significant  other’s  attempt  to  shift  the  shared  project  in  a  new 
direction  as  an  alienating  experience,  and  so  the  S elfs  reaction  to  the  estrangement 
process  can  be  understood  as  a  struggle  against  alienation,  a  diversion  from  what  it 
considers  the  path  of  authentic  becoming.  This  understanding  of  alienation  as  an

damaging nature of deceit, see Lebow (2005).
281  One  reason  for  expectations  to  diverge,  not  engaged  here,  is  when  there  are  conflicting 
loyalties, that is, when different friends make claims which cannot all be satisfied (Smith Pangle, 
2003:  135F). This opens up the issue of multiple friendships..

unwanted  separation282  expresses,  more  precisely,  the  disconnect  of  horizons  of 
expectation  and  experience  which  had  previously  lend  coherence  to  the  biographical 
narrative developed together with  the  significant Other.  Fear of alienation  is the  fear of 
‘loosing’  this  narrative  and  requires  finding  a  way  to  reduce  the  tension  between  the 
desires of recognition/belonging and the desire for authenticity.283

Preventing Alienation: Adaptation and Emancipation

Estrangement  does  not  happen  overnight but  is  a  gradual  process  in  which  the  parties 
have  the  opportunity  to  counter  an 
in  ambivalence  and  alienation  by 
renegotiating  the  shared  project.  Crudely  speaking,  the  affected  state  can  choose 
between two (not mutually exclusive) strategies: adaptation and emancipation.

Adaptation

Taking up the  suggestion  that  identities  are  ‘sticky’  or  ‘resilient’,  social  conceptions  of 
Self are not changed overnight as, after all, such a loss stability is precisely what the Self 
wants  to  avoid.  And  as  the  biography  written  through  friendships  contains  sunk  costs 
which  the  Self does  not  want  to  give  up  easily,  it  is  assumed  that  adaptation  is  the 
preferred  strategy.  Adaptation  basically  refers to  the  attempt  of state  representatives  to 
renegotiate order with the friend, which can take various forms. As research in sociology 
shows,  one  of the  most  important  measures to  ‘rescue’  friendships  is  ‘communication’ 
(Fehr  1996;  see  also  Bially  Mattem  2005b).  However,  even  a  Habermasian  discourse 
ethics  requires  a  common  ‘lifeworld’,  which  is  to  say  that  communication  reaches  its 
limits when  friends  grow dissimilar in virtue, that is,  when they  start to diverge  in their 
views over what  is the  desirable  ‘good’  order. This  comes close to Bergson’s  point that 
different  ‘inner  times’  can  be  a  hindrance  for  communication,  echoed  by  Elias,  who 
gives  a  number  of  illustrations  for  how  interaction  between  members  situated  in

282  For a discussion, see  Der  Derian  (1987).  This usage  is  found  in the writings of religious  and 
secular enlightenment thinkers accusing each other of advocating the individual’s distancing from 
god  and  from  reason,  respectively.  It  is  different  from  the  second  meaning  of  ‘alienation’ 
prevalent among social  contract scholars who put forward the  idea of a  limited transfer of rights 
to the  sovereign  in  exchange of security (Der Derian,  1987:  15-19;  Olsen  1969:  291 f>-  See  also 
Dean (1961).
283  By  focusing  on  the  fear of alienation,  the  phenomenon  is  approached  from  a  different angle 
than the one found in Marxism, which places its focus on a situation in which the (subconscious) 
separation  from  authentic being has  already occurred and  is  upheld by  material  power relations 
(Der Derian  1987: 24f).

181

One  strategy  of  dealing  with  such  dissonance  is  to  ignore  it  by  glossing  over  the 
differences.  This  may  involve  consciously  talking  ‘past’  each  other,  that  is,  relying  on 
old/familiar  but  sufficiently vague formulas which  hide the different meanings given to 
them.  Another  and  related  strategy  is  to  take  a  passive  stance  and  remain  silent.  The 
underlying concern  in both cases is that open confrontation may put the shared project at 
risk,  and  so  using familiar formulas and/or silence  is a strategy to  ‘sit things out’  in the 
hope  that  they  will  ‘return’  to  where  resonance  is  restored.  Although  friendships  lack 
formal “societal mechanisms” (Fehr,  1996:  183) which estranged parties could revert to, 
deteriorating friendships will  likely continue to rely on formalized low-level procedures 
within  the  shared  institution,  which  allows  to  keep  the  appearance  of continuing  the 
common  project  while  knowing 
for 
maintaining/recreating the bond.

A  more  forceful  strategy  is  that the  parties  will  openly  voice  discontent  and  engage  in 
making  a  “gesture  of  resistance”  (Laclau  1996)  against  expectations  placed  by  the 
significant Other to signal that these are considered unreasonable.  Rather than  hoping to 
‘sit  out’  the  dissonance,  in  this  gesture  of resistance  the  state  invokes the  theme  of the 
‘true  identity’  through  what Ernesto Laclau  calls “strategic essentialism” (Laclau,  1996: 
51).  State  representatives  will  claim  the  ‘essential’  parameters  negotiated  under  the 
familiar (now endangered)  relationship and  use this  ‘true  identity’  position  strategically 
to dmeonstrate the limits of their manoeuvring space and engage the significant Other in 
negotiations  with the aim of re-adjustment. The  gesture of resistance,  in other words,  is 
aimed at reducing the depth  of the expected  changes and  stake the position  from  which 
to renegotiate the common project without radically altering the biographical narrative.

In  the  attempt  to  balance  desires  of  belonging/recognition  with

time  not  as 
empowerment  but  in  attempts  to  impose  a  worldview  on  the  significant  Other.  The 
relationship  between  significant  Others  turns  into  a  confrontation  over the  meaning  of 
order  in  which  both  sides  attempt  to  model  the  ‘common’  project  closer  to  ‘their’ 
respective  places  in  past  and  future  and  request  that  the  significant  Other  adjusts  its 
national  biography accordingly. This can  range from subtle forms of persuasion284 to the 
exercise  of what  Bially  Mattem  terms  “representational  force”,  that  is,  a  state  where 
adjustments are not expected to be made voluntarily but under the threat of being thrown 
into a meaningless world, giving it a coercive character (Bially-Mattem, 2005a: 602).

Emancipation

If the state finds itself in a position where the significant Other is unwilling to reduce its 
expectations  and  where  it  thinks  its  voice  is  not  sufficiently  taken  into  account  in  the 
process of world building,285 and  if adaptation is perceived to require an alteration of the 
national  biography  by  pushing  it  beyond  what James  Rosenau  (1981)  calls  “acceptable 
limits”  that  would  lead  to  a  loss  of  authenticity,  the  state  will  pursue  a  strategy  of 
emancipation.

Generally  speaking,  ‘emancipation’  describes  a  process  of liberation,  that  is,  of setting 
oneself free  from  restraints “imposed  by  superior physical  force  or  legal  obligation”  as 
well  as  “from  intellectual,  moral,  or  spiritual  fetters”  (OED).  Emancipation  thus  has  a 
progressive  connotation  implying the  escaping/overcoming of a  power-relationship.  As 
Laclau  (1996)  points  out,  this  classic  account  of  emancipation  contains  a  tension: 
emancipation  is  said  to  be  marked  by  an  “absolute  chasm”,  that  is,  by  radical 
discontinuity  which,  once  achieved,  eliminates  power-relations.  Yet  understood  as 
freeing/liberating the  Self from   something/one  it  implies  prior oppression  o f something 
that  must  be  liberated  and  which,  consequently,  pre-exists  the  act  of  emancipation. 
Hence,  for emancipation to be meaningful  it cannot simply be  ground-breaking but also

284 On persuasion Mueller (2004); Lebow (2007).
285 Note:  The emergence of a power-over dynamic in which A can  ‘threaten’  B with  a loss of the 
shared  world  implies  that  the  relationship  has  turned  into  one  of asymmetric  interdependence. 
The question  how asymmetry emerges,  essentially about how one side can  have more soft power 
than the other, is important yet difficult to answer in the abstract.

requires a ‘dimension of ground’ to stand on. As Laclau points out, this ‘classic’  account 
of  emancipation  is  logically  incoherent.  The  main  tension  arises  between  seeing 
emancipation (i) as a complete break with what has been before, as a founding act which 
constitutes a radically new identity and (ii) as a process that liberates a pre-existing Self 
which  had  been  oppressed,  without which  the  very  desire  for  emancipation  would  not 
arise  (Laclau  1996:  3f.).  Despite  their  logical  incompatibility,  he  suggests  the  two 
dimensions are necessary elements of emancipation (Ibid, 6).

Laclau’s  discussion  is  valuable  in  drawing  attention  to  this  tension  between  reading 
emancipation  as  ‘liberation’  and  as  ‘creation’,  yet  whether  the  two  are  logically 
incompatible  depends  on  how  radical  the  break  is.  The  tension  Laclau  identifies,  also 
captured in the paradox that, given the anxiety controlling function of friendship, friends 
should  never  allow  their  relationship  to  dissolve  in  the  first  place,  rests  on  the 
understanding  that  the  sense  of Self is  constituted  in  relation  with  the  Other  and  that 
breaking with this relationship means it desires to become something else, the possibility 
of which  it  presumably has  learned  outside  this relationship.  Yet  is this  the  case?  Must 
this  possibility  have  been  disclosed  in  complete  independence  or  can  some  of  the 
previously  established  ‘ground’  not  be  carried  over within  that vision  which  drives  the 
emancipatory  move?  The  question  is,  once  again,  how  to  think  about  this  ‘ground’  on 
which  Selfhood  stands,  how  the  internal/personal  (domestic)  and  the  external/social 
(international) dimensions of Selfhood relate. For Bially Mattem  ‘demagnetized’ friends 
are  able to maintain their sense of Self and  restore their  special  relationship by drawing 
on  sources  outside  the  friendship,  by  following  Wendt  and  assuming  that  states  have 
what she calls a ‘primordial nugget’ (Bially Mattem 2005:  60).

By  contrast,  for  an  ontology  which  understands  authentic  being  as  both  social  and 
evolutionary, the  break can  never be truly  ‘radical’,  for two  reasons:  First, there  cannot 
be  a  complete  break  in  the  national  biography,  that  is,  it  cannot  become  completely 
disconnected  from  its  experienced  space  as  even  new  utopias  cannot  leave  the  past 
‘behind’  in the  sense of ignoring/denying it.  Second,  and  quite  importantly,  it  is not the 
relationship per se  that  is  being  abandoned  but  the  relationship  in  which  friends  have 
become  strangers.  Said  differently, 
the  bygone 
‘friendship’  integrated  into  it  because  that  relationship  still  fits,  that  is,  it  has  become

the  biographical  narrative  has 

184

part  of the  experienced  space  and  still  resonates  with  the  world  building  project.286  So 
rather than conceiving of emancipation as an  ‘absolute chasm’, it is understood here as a 
conservative-creative process which allows change within some sort of continuity.

The  question  whether the  Self will  pursue  a strategy  of emancipation  depends  not  only 
on  the  how  much  change  would  be  necessary  for  A  to  accommodate  B’s  expectations 
but  also  how  much  does  A  depend  on  B.  In  other  words,  there  is  the  question  of the 
availability  of an  alternative  as,  after  all,  from  a  friendship  perspective  a  state  cannot 
maintain  what  it  considers  its  authentic  biographical  narrative  on  its  own.  Hence,  the 
process of emancipation as understood here is a search for alternative ways of satisfying 
desires  of  belonging  and  recognition,  more  specifically  a  search  for  an  alternative 
significant  Other  with  whom  a  common  project  can  be  more  successfully  negotiated. 
While  in  this  process  the  biographical  narrative  also  will  also  undergo  change,  the 
adaptation required will  be more attractive if the  Self has more influence  in determining 
the direction these changes take.

Hence,  adaptation  and  emancipation  are  not  mutually  exclusive  strategies  and  affected 
states  likely  pursue  a  combination  of both.  As  noted  above,  the  emancipation  process 
does  not  imply  a  radical  discontinuity  of relations  in  which  everything  is  left  behind 
(Laclau  1996:  2).  However,  strategies  of adaptation  and  emancipation  can  be  pursued 
simultaneously  only  up  to  a  point.  While  states  may  possess  close  relations  with  more 
than  one  significant Other,  the  phenomenon of ‘multiple  identities’  has  its  limits  in the 
fact that an authentic national  biography can only accommodate so many compromises: 
“although  we  may  have  a  diversity  of relatively  discrete  selves,  there  needs  to  be...a 
continuing  theme”  (Hogg  and  Vaughan  2002:  125).  To  avoid  becoming  entangled  in 
conflicting  projects,  intimate  relations  are  layered,  with  the  preference  being  placed  on 
the one which supports the project in which the unfolding Self feels more ‘at home’.

286 This is not too  different from Aristotle who argues that after friendships dissolve “surely  [the 
Self] must keep some memory of the familiarity they had” (NE, Book IX, 3).

Applying the Lens:  Looking Ahead

With  the  causal  narrative  completed  in  the  abstract,  the  task  ahead  is  to  apply  the 
theoretical frame developed thus far to the dynamic of German-American cooperation as 
captured at the outset: (i) the consensus that NATO was the institution most desirable for 
dealing with  ‘European  security’  in  the  post-WW  II  decade (1945-55),  (ii) the  tensions 
between  Bonn  and  Washington  over  the  usefulness  of CSCE  in  the  ‘detente’  decade 
(1965-75),  and  (iii)  the  divergence  over  institutional  preferences  for  the  purpose  of 
‘European  security’  in  the  decade  surrounding  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  (1985-95) 
signified  by  German  investment  in  CFSP  as  an  institution  which  excluded the  US.  The 
task  is to  make sense of this dynamic by  framing it as  a phenomenon  of friendship and 
estrangement/emancipation and provide evidence for why it occurred.

The  empirical  analysis  first  needs  to  identify  the  parameters  of the  ‘national  security 
interest’  on each  side to then determine the presence or absence of a  ‘common’  security 
interest.  Rather than  engaging  military-strategic  thinking  about  force  structures  among 
the  military  establishment, the theoretical  lens  applied  here  understands  security  policy 
as being about creating and  maintaining order within a national  biography and to assess 
the  overlap  between  German  and  American  conceptions  of the  same.  This  provides the 
basis  on  which  the  usefulness  (or  value)  of  a  security  institution  is  evaluated  and, 
consequently,  the  investment or  lack thereof in  a common  institution  can  be explained. 
In  more  specific  terms,  the  task  is  to  identify  how  political  leaders  in  Bonn  and  in 
Washington formulated national  biographies  in their spatial and temporal  dimension -  a 
meaningful  narrative  of  what  Germany-in-the-world  and  America-in-the-world 
could/should  become  -   and  to  show  how  the  (lacking)  overlap  of  those  narratives 
explains  the  commitment  (or  lack  thereof)  to  invest  in  NATO,  CSCE,  and  CFSP, 
respectively.

As the  formation and  weakening of friendship  bonds -  the emergence of resonance and 
dissonance  in  national  biographies  and  the  success  or  failure  in  negotiating  a  shared 
project -   and  the  corresponding  investment  in  international  institutions  takes  time,  the 
empirical analysis spans three ten-year periods.  Each period will  address the same set of 
questions,  namely  (i)  how  political  leaders  formulated  the  national  biography  of 
‘Germany-in-the-world’  and  ‘America-in-the-world’, respectively, (ii) whether and how 
these  narratives  connect  and  (iii)  how 
this  (dis)conriection  motivates  common 
institutional  investments.  Although  the  US  side  will  be  given  ample  consideration,  for 
reasons outlined  in the  introduction the empirical analysis is biased towards the German

186

side.  Broken  down  for  each  period,  the  investigation  is  going  to  present  the  following 
account:

In  the  first  period  (1945-55)  the  analysis  will  be  looking  for  the  reformulation  of the 
narratives  situating  ‘Germany’  and  ‘America’  in  the  world  after the  end  of the  Second 
World  War were closely interwoven and resonated with each other.  It presents evidence 
for  how  both  sides  agreed  on  a  vision  of how  to  order  a  shared  experienced  space  in 
which  national  biographies  could  be  embedded,  and  that  NATO  was  the  desirable 
institution through which the common project of ‘world building’  should be pursued.  In 
that  context,  it  suggests  that  American  and  German  policymakers  saw  each  other  as 
equals and were content with each other’s contribution to the shared project.

The  analysis  of the  second  period  (1965-75)  will  show  first  signs  estrangement.  It will 
discuss how German enthusiasm and  US  hesitancy to  invest in CSCE was accompanied 
by disagreement over the usefulness of NATO as the institution through which to build a 
meaningful  ‘being-in-the-world’  and  trace  this  to  dissonance  between  Bonn  and 
Washington  over  ideas/visions  of  order.  While  the  analysis  will  present  evidence  of 
misunderstandings and  signs of distrust,  accusations of lacking reciprocity (expressed  in 
complaints  to  insufficient  ‘burden  sharing’)  and  unequal  treatment  (expressed,  for 
instance,  in complaints about arrogance),  it suggests that sufficient adaptation took place 
to  conceal/reconcile  the  dissonance,  allowing  sufficient  ‘room  of manoeuvre’  for  both 
along the limits of the shared project.

The  third  period  (1985-95)  is  will  show  further  dissonance  between  German  and 
American  policymakers,  only  that  now  adaptation  attempts  are  expected  to  remain 
insufficient  in  reconciling  the  dissonance  and  holding  off  the  estrangement  process, 
prompting Bonn to pursue a strategy of emancipation.  The discussion provides evidence 
for  deep  and  enduring  disagreements  over  ideas  of  order,  expressed  in  diverging 
expectations  about  appropriate  contributions  to  the  shared  project  and  in  feelings  of 
ambivalence  in  Bonn  about  the  direction  for  Germany’s  unfolding.  Furthermore,  it 
suggests that German  leaders concluded that expectations held  in  Washington could  not 
be  met  without  substantially  compromising  (violating)  the  authenticity  of Germany’s 
national  biography  and  that this  motivated  them  to  invest  in  CFSP  with  an  alternative 
significant Other.

As noted in the introduction, the phenomenological lens on the development of ‘national 
biographies’  requires a hermeneutical  approach.  This means adopting the perspective of

187

the  ‘state’  in  question  by standing  in the  shoes,  so to  say,  of those political  leaders  in  a 
position  of formulating  and  representing  the  national  biography.  It  requires  analytical 
empathy and  seeks to offer a deliberately uncritical  reconstruction  of how these  leaders 
represented Germany’s or America’s ‘being-in-the-world’.

In  this  context,  it  must  be  noted  upfront  that  three  central  aspects  of the  theoretical 
narrative are difficult to carve out empirically.  The first concerns  identifying feelings of 
anxiety and,  in an attempt to control the same, desires for belonging/recognition and  for 
authenticity  expressed  by  political  leaders  and  the  broader  community  they  represent. 
While the empirical analysis must provide some indication that these feelings are present 
and  drive  decisions/behaviour,  this  requires  some  interpretative  sensitivity/freedom  as 
these feelings are rarely shown in public or voiced in these terms.

The  second  difficulty  concerns  the  argument that  national  biographies  are  constructed 
together/in  interaction  with  significant  others  (the  intimate  bonds  of friendship).  This 
process,  in  which  both  sides  come  to  agree  (or  not)  on  how  to  order  an  overlapping 
experienced  space  by  formulating  a  meaningful  vision  of  it  that  resonates  with  their 
understanding  of  ‘being-in-the-world’  is  difficult  to  trace  systematically.  It  does  not 
proceed  in  a  neat  sequential  interaction  which  can  be traced  in  a  linear fashion,  or  in  a 
feedback  loop  of action  and  reaction.  Rather,  this  process  of ‘mutual  constitution’  is  a 
messy  one  in  which  biographical  narratives  become  interwoven  with  each  other  and 
draw on each other simultaneously and indirectly through the shared project.

The third aspect concerns the process of ‘emancipation’, namely that states which  loosen 
their  friendship  bonds  and,  correspondingly,  show  reduced  interest  in  the  institution 
through  which  their  shared  project  has  been  pursued,  need  an  alternative  friend  with 
whom  a  common  project  can  be  more  successfully  negotiated.  This  effectively  brings 
another  ‘special’  relationship  into  the  analysis.  Specifically,  the  analysis  of enduring 
dissonance  between  the  German  and  the  US  narrative  and  the  emancipation  of  the 
former  from  the  latter  would  ideally  be  accompanied  by  an  analysis  of the  growing 
resonance  of German  ideas of order with those  of another state,  namely France.  Such  a 
parallel  analysis  is omitted  here,  as  it would  either blow the third  part out of proportion 
or come at a cost of a more detailed understanding of the dynamics in German-American 
relations.287

287 The omission  is compensated for by the  fact that the development of intimate bonds between 
Bonn and Paris is well documented in the literature and can be referenced where appropriate.

CHAPTER EIGHT: NATO / GERMAN-US CONSENSUS (1945-1955)

Introduction
This chapter offers an explanation for what motivated German and American investment 
in NATO  in the decade following the end of the  Second  World War (1945-55).  Echoing 
the  view  that  German-American  security  cooperation  was  not  based  on  a  military 
rationale  but about „wrapping political  problems of an  entirely different  kind”  (Krieger 
in  Schwabe  1994:  47),288 the chapter assesses the  explanatory  power of the  ‘friendship’ 
argument  developed  over  the  previous  chapters.  It  outlines  the  need  for  regaining 
orientation  after  the  end  of the  war  and  how  the  narratives  situating  ‘Germany’  and 
‘America’  in  ‘the  world’  after  1945  came to  resonate with  each  other.  Specifically,  the 
chapter explores how political  leaders came to agree (a) on a particular vision giving rise 
to  a  project  in  which  respective  national  biographies  could  be  embedded  and  (b)  on 
NATO  as  the  most  suitable  institution  for  pursuing  this  project.  With  a  focus  on  the 
German side, the chapter pays particular attention to Konrad Adenauer as an agent who 
successfully  formulated  a  Germany-in-Europe  narrative  in  mutual  empowerment  with 
American  counterparts  thereby  establishing  the  German-American  friendship  through 
NATO.

The  chapter proceeds  as  follows.  The  first part  lays out the  experiences  and  lessons  on 
the  basis  of which  a  new  narrative  of ‘Germany’  was  built  and  shows  how  these  were 
linked  to  the  vision  of Germany  unfolding  into  a  ‘united  Europe’  free  and  at  peace. 
Capturing  his  anxiety  of not  being  able  to  control  Germany’s  future  in  the  ‘Potsdam 
complex’,  it  is  shown  how  Adenauer  projected  Germany  into  the  Western  space  and 
located  the  US  as  a  friend.  The  second  part  shows  how  his  vision  of Germany  in  a 
‘United  States  of Europe’  resonated  with  the  American  agenda  of finding  a  place  for 
‘Europe’  and a new Germany in  its national biography. The third part demonstrates how 
this  formed  the  basis  for  a German-American  consensus  about  German  rearmament as 
an  attempt to  ‘contribute’  to the  Western  project and thereby  increase Germany’s voice 
in the Western space through NATO.

Reinventing ‘Germany’
The  end  of the  war  required  the  reinvention  of  ‘Germany’.  After  Hitler’s  death,  the 
breakdown  of the  Nazi  regime and the unconditional  surrender  in  May  1945,  relief that 
the  war  was  over  was  mixed  with  a  feeling  of  loss  and  disorientation.  Indeed,  it  is

important to be reminded with Axel  Schildt that for the majority of Germans the  end of 
the  war  appeared  as  “a catastrophic  collapse  rather than  liberation”  (Schildt  2007:  32). 
Germany  had  been  defeated  in  yet  another  war  which  left  the  country  in  ruins, 
diminished  its population  by about  10 per cent,  its territory by about 20  per cent,  while 
displacing  millions.  The  shadow  government  was  dissolved  by  the  Allies  in  late  May 
and  a  week  later,  on  5  June  1945,  the  Allied  Control  Council  proclaimed  supreme 
authority.  Alfred  Grosser  puts 
total 
disempowerment”  (Grosser  1985:  14).  Wilhelm  Grewe,  a  German  law  professor  and 
close advisor to Adenauer, noted that Germany had “lost...its character [Eigenschaft]  of 
a state” (Grewe  1960/52: 3).

total  war...ended  with 

it  succinctly:  “the 

The  loss was  not merely a  legal  one (of ‘sovereignty’) or a  material  one  (of people  and 
territory).  In  addition,  what  was  lost  to  most  Germans  with  the  collapse  of National 
Socialism  was  an  understanding  of  what  ‘Germany’  was  meant  to  be(come).  The 
biographical  narrative  constructed  by  Hitler’s  regime  culminating  in  a  Thousand  Year 
Reich  utopia  had  defined  the  meaning of ‘Germany’  and  its  place  in  the  world  as  the 
rightful  ruler of ‘Europe’  for more than a decade.  It had  propagated  a glorious  German 
history,  cultural/racial  superiority  and  megalomaniac  visions  of  a  ‘Thousand  Year 
Reich’  given aesthetic texture in all kinds of exhibitions,  Riefenstahl  images and  Speer’s 
architectural  plans.  As  outlined  by  Hitler  in  Mein  Kampf,  in  this  narrative  German 
authentic existence was intertwined with the claim to rule  ‘Europe’.  Picturing a world of 
great “spatial  formations”, among which  he counted the  British  Empire, the US,  Russia, 
and  China,  Hitler’s  aim  was  to  have  ‘Germany’  recognized  as  a  great  power  and  to 
expand  the  Lebensraum  of  the  German  people  over and  bring  order to  “our  European 
homeland”  (reprinted  in  O  Tuathail  et  al.  1998:  36-39).  While  this  narrative  may  not 
have been embraced by all,  it was accepted  by the majority of the population until close 
to the end of the war and now needed to be replaced.289 As Schildt notes “national hubris 
was followed by a mood of moral depression” and abstract fear (Schildt 2007: 33).

Thus,  in the summer of 1945,  political  leaders had to find a new answer to the  ‘German 
question’  by  recreating  a  narrative  of Germany-in-the-world.290  In  addition  to  physical 
reconstruction, the renewal of Germany as a country, a society, a participant in the world 
required  an  narrative  which  dealt  with  the  memories  and  redefined  the  vision  towards 
which  a post-war  ‘Germany’  could  unfold.  In an  interview with  a British journalist that 
summer,  Adenauer  described  Germany  as  a  spiritual  desert  and  noted  that  just  as

190

in  space  and 

important  as  material  reconstruction  was  stilling  hunger  for  new  “spiritual  values” 
[geistige  Werte],  stressing  the  need  to  “give  the  people  new  ideas!”  (cited  in  Schwarz 
1986:  442).  In  the  terminology  introduced  earlier,  the  task  was  to  redefine  a  coherent 
national  biography  of  Germany 
time  which  satisfied  desires  for 
belonging/recognition  and  authenticity.  It required  an  answer to  what Verheyen  (1991) 
calls  the  two  faces  of the  ‘German  question’,  an  internal  and  an  external  one:  how  to 
reconstruct  a  Germany  its  citizens  would  want to  live  in  and  one  which  others  would 
agree to live with. As two emigres to the United States noted Germany was “a country in 
search  of friends, just  as  she  is  a  country  in  search  of herself’  (Deutsch  and  Edinger 
1959:  20).

Who  was  in  the  position  of  remaking  the  biography  of  Germany-in-the-world?  The 
Allied  Council  devised  in  Potsdam  formally  enjoyed  supreme  authority,  yet  this 
authority  was  soon  decentralized  and  moved  to  the  military  (and 
later  civilian) 
commanders of the respective (three, then four) zones.  What was  initially envisioned  as 
a  central  administrative  ‘European’  organ  for  occupied  Germany  was  turned  into  a 
fractioned authority without much coordination; that is,  fragmented not only  in terms of 
location,  but  also  in  the  directives  it  was  to  install  (Mai  1994).  Beyond  a  general 
agreement  to  set  up  measures  preventing  future  German  aggression  and  extracting 
reparation  payments  as  outlined 
in  the  Potsdam  Agreement,  captured  under  the 
objectives  of  demilitarization,  denazification,  and  decartellisation  (which  basically 
meant  destroying  German  war  industry),  the  Allies’  ideas  about  what  to  do  with 
Germany after Hitler were “neither specific nor compatible” (Pulzer  1995:  24). Different 
answers were rooted in different views about the causes of the Third  Reich:  was Nazism 
a  disease  from  which  the  German  society  could  be  cured?  Was  there  a  logical 
continuation  of  ‘Prussian’  aggression  from  Bismarck  to  Hitler?  Or  was  the  rise  of 
Nazism  caused  by  structural  economic  inequality  and  the  work  of  capitalist  elites? 
Policymakers  in  London,  Washington,  Paris,  and  Moscow  diverged  in  their  views  not 
only  about  the  balance  between  punishment  and  re-education  but  also  disagreed  over 
what each would entail (Grosser  1985:  15f.;  Mai,  1994).  In  short, there was no coherent 
plan  in place  in the summer of 1945  and one could  say “there was a vacuum...in Allied 
policy” (Pulzer,  1995: 23; Judt 2005).

Into  this  ‘vacuum’,  German  political  life  developed  rather  quickly.  The  first  two  post­
war years  saw  a  fast  development of political  institutions  and,  within  them,  an  intense 
domestic debate  about the  direction  the  ‘new’  Germany  should  take  (Pulzer  1995:  32). 
Although this happened  with oversight from the occupying powers, the  political  figures

191

emerging  were  no  administrative  puppets.  Leadership  was  (allowed  to  be)  claimed  by 
experienced  politicians  who  had  either  avoided  or  resisted  the  Nazi  regime,  gone  into 
either  mental  or  physical  exile,  or endured  in  captivity.  These  personalities  had  strong 
views over what had gone wrong and were eager to  ‘correct’  the German path and were 
able  to  reactivate  structures  of party  organization  deeply  rooted  in  Germany’s  political 
tradition.  While success  in creating the new narrative depended on a fruitful connection 
to  narratives  of  the  occupiers,  their  determination  to  redefine  ‘Germany’  was  not  a 
response  to  external  pressure  and  their  ideas  were  not  a  result  of  re-education 
programmes (Grosser,  1985: 42ff).

Adenauer
There  was  no  consensus  among  German  politicians  on  how  to  deal  with  the  memory 
space  left  by  the  Third  Reich.  Beyond  the  condemnation  and  rejection  of  Hitler’s 
narrative,  domestic 
the  adequate 
(re)placement  of  ‘Germany’  in  time  and  space.  Crudely  speaking,  there  were  three 
camps on the issue of what was a ‘good’ order:291  Those envisioning a communist order, 
those  emphasizing a  socialist-democratic  one,  and  those  advocating  a  liberal-Christian- 
conservative society.  Although the communist party existed  in the  Western zone until  it 
was banned in  1956, most of its supporters moved to the Soviet zone. The second group, 
represented  by  the  SPD  under  the  leadership  of  Kurt  Schumacher,  appeared  to  be 
predestined  to  politically  dominate  the  ‘new’  Germany  due  to  its  strong  democratic 
tradition,  its  institutional  base  and  the  fact that  it was the  only  one  of the  major parties 
which had opposed  Hitler’s rise and paid the costs.  However,  Schumacher and  his  SPD 
lost  the  leadership  position  to  the  third  group  around  Konrad  Adenauer  and  the  newly 
created  Christian  Democratic Union  (CDU), who won the  1949  election  by one vote  in 
coalition with the Bavarian sister party (CSU) and the  Liberal  Party  (FDP) and  was  re­
elected in  1953 by a wide margin.

Adenauer’s  rise  and  his  success  in  claiming  the  political  leadership  in  the  Western 
occupied  zones  has  been  comprehensively  discussed  by  historians  like  Hans-Peter 
Schwarz (1986).292  A  seasoned  politician  who  had  experienced the  occupation  after the 
First World War as mayor of Cologne, Adenauer reemerged as the chairman of the CDU 
in the British zone and, after holding multiple offices,  including of the assembly writing

the Basic  Law, became Chancellor of the newly founded FRG  in  1949.  Viewed through 
the friendship lens, Adenauer’s successful claim of (West) German leadership was owed 
to his ability of redefining Germany’s course together with Western powers, in particular 
the  United  States,  in  a way that found  approval  of his domestic constituency and which 
famously  lead  Schumacher to  call  him  ‘the chancellor of the  allies’.293  Said  differently, 
what  united  Adenauer’s  domestic  opponents,  namely the  discomfort  with  his  course  of 
Westintegration,294  was  precisely  what  made  him  attractive  to  Americans.  In  outlining 
this  (mutual)  empowerment,  this  chapter  agrees  with  the  contention  that  “to  an 
exceptional  extent...the  study of West German  foreign  policy  [during this  period]  must 
be  based  on  an  appraisal  of Adenauer”  (Richardson,  1966:  11),  while  steering a course 
between  the  view  that  “in  the  beginning  was  Adenauer”  (Baring  1969:  2)  and  the 
counter-argument that “in the beginning were the allies” (Haftendom, 2006: 9).

There is ample evidence that Adenauer, who also occupied the post of Foreign Minister 
until  1955, embedded his decisions within a broader understanding of a German national 
biography.295 Often described as a pragmatic and cunning tactitioner, he was also known 
to  be  stubborn  and  authoritarian  in  his  aim  of nudging  the  evolution  of things  in  one 
direction  rather  than  another.  According  to  his  biographers,  including  his  long-term 
assistant,  Adenauer  was  convinced  that  political  practice  must  be  guided  by  basic 
principles  (Grundsatze)  and  long trajectories  or tendencies  (Entwicklungstendenzen).296 
In  his  memoirs  Adenauer  wrote  that  fate  was  determined  by  “big  ideas”  and  “ethical 
foundations”  and  defined  politics  as  the  art  to  realize  over  the  long  term  what  was 
recognized as morally right (in  Poppinga  1975:  13).  His  ‘big  ideas’  for Germany,  more 
specifically  for  the  direction  it  was  going,  were  significantly  influenced  by  the  place 
from where he saw the world. As Amulf Baring (1969:  48-62) notes, whereas Bismarck 
had  thought  about  Germany’s  place  in  Europe  from  Prussia,  Adenauer  did  the  same 
from the Rhine region, more specifically from  Cologne.297  Before delineating the  broad 
contours of the  ‘Germany’  narrative Adenauer pursued,  creating what some have called

293 On the debate between Adenauer and Schumacher, see Weber and Kowert (2007:  Ch.  3). The 
friendship  lens  suggests  that  Schumacher  was  unable  to  create  a  vision  of a  new  ‘Germany’ 
which  resonated with  both  the  German public and the  Western  Allies,  in particular the  US.  This 
disconnect is not the purpose of this chapter, yet it is indicated by Schumacher’s skepticism about 
Westintegration and NATO membership and the  labeling of him  as a  ‘nationalist’, points  which 
Adenauer highlighted and skillfully exploited in his own meeting with US officials.
294  In  addition  to  Schumacher,  Adenauer  fought  party-internal  political  battles  with  Andreas 
Hermes and Karl Kaiser over party leadership and with Gustav Heinemann over rearmament.
295  Lord  Pakenham,  minister  for  Germany  in  the  British  cabinet,  described  Adenauer  as  acting 
“like a grandfather” on behalf of a German people he did not trust (cited in Baring  1969: 58).

a  ‘Rhenish  Republic’,  it  is  necessary  to  outline  his  source  of  anxiety,  the  Potsdam 
complex.

The  *Potsdam Complex’
The  ‘Potsdam  complex’  is  recognised  among  Adenauer  scholars  as  a  fundamental 
element  guiding  his  policy  and  captures  the  concern  that  Germany’s  future  would  be 
shaped  by  others  (Poppinga  1975:  105,  124f).  There  is  no  doubt  Adenauer  resented 
being treated  like a second  rate  head of state,298 yet at the core of the  Potsdam  complex 
was  not  hurt  personal  pride.  Instead,  it  was  his  anxiety  of not  being  able  to  influence 
what  Germany  would  become  and,  thus,  of not  being  able  to  ‘see’  Germany’s  future 
because  of the  ever-present possibility of a  revival  of the  Allied  control  council  and  its 
claim  to  supreme  authority,  that  is,  ‘another  Potsdam’  (Grewe  1960:  57).299  Said 
differently, he was anxious about Fremdbestimmung, the possibility that the direction of 
the  ‘new’  Germany  would  be  determined  by  others  he  could  not  meaningfully 
communicate with and/or which would not listen to him.

Adenauer’s  main  concern  was  that 
incompatible  worldviews  would  prevent  the 
occupying  powers  from  coming  to  an  agreement  about  what  to  do  with  ‘Germany’, 
thereby  keeping  it  in  a  state  of uncertainty  and  without  direction.  This  fear was  fuelled 
through the experience  of the  immediate post-war years,  where there  appeared to  be  no 
coherent  plan  for  Germany’s  future  among  the  Western  allies.  While  the  Russians 
seemed  determined  in  creating  their  idea  of  order  in  the  Eastern  zone,  Adenauer 
repeatedly  complained  about  discriminatory  practices  and  about  chaos  in  planning  and 
administration  in the Western  sectors, calling it a “verhaegnisvolles Durcheinander” (in 
Schwarz  1986:  443-447;  Foschepoth  1997).  For  Adenauer  this  reduced  Germany’s 
ability  to  re-invent  herself and  pursue  a  meaningful  project.  Indeed,  across  party  lines 
the  view  prevailed  that  the  occupiers  were  to  assist  reconstruction  and  open  up  a  new 
path Germans could  invest in.300 The second facet of Adenauer’s Potsdam  complex was 
the concern that Germans could  become attached to the wrong  ideas (wrong,  of course, 
in  his  estimate).  He  feared  that  should  there  be  a  four-power  agreement  resulting  in

298  Symbolic  is  this  well-known  episode:  when  summoned  onto  the  Petersberg  to  present  his 
cabinet  and  receive  the  occupying  statute  in  late  1949,  the  newly  elected  chancellor refused  to 
follow the protocol and stay off the carpet on which the three High Commissioners were standing 
(Baring  1969: 66).
299 In  1953  Adenauer famously described his “nightmare” (‘it’s called Potsdam’) in an  interview, 
see Schwabe (1994:  81).
300  A Sueddeutsche Zeitung article  complained  about  “that  floating  uncertainty  which  currently 
makes German planning for the future more or less illusionary. Germany needs to know its path. 
It should be shown  [this path] now” (von Briick,  1946).

194

German  ‘neutrality’,  this  would  keep  Germany  unstable  and  increase  the  risk  to  again 
move  down  the  ‘wrong  path’  (Poppinga,  1975:  105f).301  This  concern  was  behind  his 
note to the  steering committee  of his  party that the  great  danger to  Germany was  to  be 
“sacrificed  on  the  altar  of  reconciliation  between  East  and  West”  (in  Niedhart  and 
Altmann  1988:  103).

Thus,  for  Adenauer  the  importance  of creating  stable  bonds  was  not just  a  pragmatic 
strategy  bom  out  of the  inevitability  of accommodating  the  occupiers.  His  conviction 
that  ‘Germany’  needed to be developed  with someone was a core theme reflected  in  his 
gloomy  predictions  of what  would  happen  if Germany  became  ‘neutral’.  According  to 
Adenauer,  the  wars  and  occupations  in  German  history  were  the  result  of a  policy  of 
shifting  alignments  or  ‘seesaw  policy’  [Schaukelpolitik]  between  East  and  West,  of 
mishandling the country’s middle position in  ‘Europe’, or its Mittellage.302 As he saw it, 
the  failure of political  leaders to create  lasting bonds had  made  it difficult for Germans 
to manifest a stable sense of Self and eventually allowed the  ‘wrong ideas’  to take hold. 
While  his  warning  to  party  colleagues  that  “it  was  Germany’s  great  misfortune  that  it 
has  always  been  without real  friends”  (in  Poppinga  1975:  48)  was  clearly  exaggerated, 
the  scenario  of  a  country  (at  risk  of)  drifting  into  loneliness  was  effectively  (and 
repeatedly) used by Adenauer to denounce the directions chosen by his rivals.

Adenauer dealt with the  ‘Potsdam complex’  by trying to gain a voice in the negotiations 
amongst  the  Western  allies  about  Germany’s  future  and  to  thereby  influence  the 
parameters  of the  space the  ‘new’  Germany would  unfold  into.  As  discussed  below,  he 
expressed this goal in repeated demands to gain the status of an ‘equal’ or ‘full partner’ a 
demand  which  also  applied  to  NATO  membership  after  the  formation  of the  Atlantic 
Alliance in  1949. The reason this request was largely granted in Washington was that the 
narrative  of  ‘Germany-in-Europe’  Adenauer  presented  resonated  with  American 
policymakers.

Sorting the Memory Space
The  formulation  of a  ‘new’  German  narrative  required  connecting  past  (memory)  and 
future (visions). The notion of 1945 as an ‘hour zero’  for Germany was not to imply that

301  That  is,  neutrality  would  provide  no  guard  against  the  temptation  to  follow  the  communist 
vision, in case of which  ‘Potsdam’ would lead to ‘Prague’. See the discussion below.
302 Adenauer’s complaint that the ‘discontinuity’  in the German narrative makes it difficult for its 
people  to  find  a  stable  place  (Poppinga  1975:  99)  built  on  Helmut  Plessner’s  notion  of  the 
‘delayed  nation’  (coined  in  1935).  Scholars  have  since  called  this  the  German  ‘dilemma’ 
(Bracher,  1971) or ‘problem’ (Calleo,  1978). See also Schwarz (1994); Verheyen (1999).

195

reconstruction  was  occurring  from  a  historically  blank  slate;  obviously  it  did  not.  The 
past  could  not  be  discarded  and  there  remained  plenty  of continuity  in  everyday  life 
(Doering-Manteuffel  1983:  9-24;  Schildt  2007).  Adenauer’s  task  “to  form  a  new  state 
out  of the Konkursmasse  of the  Reich”  (Foschepoth  1988:  40)  was  to  use the  memory 
space  the  war  had  created  in  a  way  that  signalled  a  break  with  the  Third  Reich  and 
satisfied domestic and international audiences. This task was marked by the fact that the 
German  question  was  really  a  European  question.  It  was  not  only  that  ‘Europe’  was 
Germany’s experienced  space  and  the  situatedness  of the  latter  in the  former had  to  be 
rethought.  Given  the  violent  way  the  ‘Third  Reich’  had  attempted  to  order  this  space, 
‘Germany-in-Europe’  had become a central and negative place in the experience of other 
(European)  nations,  weaving  German  military  aggression  and  genocide  into  their 
biographical narratives.

In  order to  make  the  past  meaningful  Adenauer  drew  on  ‘usable  pasts’  and  frequently 
invoked  historical  analogies  and  their  lessons  (Poppinga  1975:  44-56).  This  was  a 
balancing  effort  which  also  dealt  with  silences.  Adenauer  was  aware  that  there  were 
things  many  Germans  preferred  to  ‘forget’  (Poppinga  1975:  99).  This  meant,  in 
particular, establishing a “cordon sanitaire around Nazi crimes” (Kansteiner 2006:  111). 
Despite  efforts  by  the  occupying  powers  to  confront  Germans  with  the  horrors  of the 
concentration  camps,  the  Holocaust  was  eradicated  from  public  debate  by  way  of 
‘forgetting’ and deflecting responsibility to superiors, a strategy aided by the Nuremberg 
trials  and  the  formal  ‘denazification’  process.  Adenauer  knew that this  silence  and  the 
maintenance  of memories  of ‘better  times’  and  own  suffering  from  bombardment  and 
expulsion,303  was  unsuitable  for  the  reformulation  of a  national  biography,  especially 
with  outside  partners.  Adenauer  knew  that  any  project  capable  of  creating  new 
friendships  needed  to  start  from  a  rejection  of the  Third  Reich,  also  reflected  in  his 
support  for  compensation  -   ‘ Wiedergutmachung’  -   for  Jewish  victims  of  the  Third 
Reich, which  he considered  essential  for Germany’s moral regeneration (Schwarz  1986: 
898f.)

Broadly speaking, Adenauer’s narrative highlighted two negative  legacies,  ‘illiberalism’ 
and  ‘militarism’.  These  two  were  core  elements  which  the  Allies  had  identified  in  the 
Potsdam  Agreement  and  vowed  to  root  out  in  their  design  for  any  post-war  German 
order.  It was  not difficult for Adenauer to confirm them with  a narrative that these  had

196

been  elements of a “misguided nationalism” embedded  in the “wrong conception of the 
state” (in Poppinga  1975:  lOlf.).304

The  ‘legacy of illiberalism’ portrayed the Third Reich as the climax of a Germany which 
in  comparison  to  other  European  societies  had  failed  to  translate  the  values  of  the 
enlightenment into a stable political,  i.e.  democratic order (Verheyen  1999:  20ff).305  For 
Adenauer,  Germans  had  accepted  an  order  without  respect  of the  dignity  and  value  of 
the  individual  and  ignored  the  spiritual  foundation  of Christian-humanist thinking.  He 
blamed  this  on  a  mix  of modernity  and  Marxism,  more  precisely,  on  industrialisation 
having  created  a  society  focused  on  material  values  and  seduced  by  the  socialist  idea, 
culminating  in  collectivist  mass  movement  and  the  centralisation  of  power  which 
disrespected  individual  rights (Poppinga  1975;  Schwarz  1986).  In the German  case,  the 
‘legacy  of militarism’  stood  not  only  for  aggressive  foreign  policy  but  for  a  way  of 
organizing  society,  that  is,  as  a  principle  of  domestic  order.  It  pictured  a  Germany 
dominated  by the  ‘Prussian  tradition’  where the  military  was  considered  the  ‘school  of 
the  nation’  and  feeding  an  authoritarian  mindset.  With  the  military  having  enjoyed 
considerable political  influence,  it also was seen to have played a key role in the demise 
of the Weimar Republic, lifting Hitler to power and leading Germany into the war.

In  Adenauer’s  narrative  that  ‘wrong’  conception  of the  German  state  constituted  by 
these  two  ideas  was  ‘Prussian’  (later  replaced  by the  GDR).  Symbolic  for this  was  his 
first  major  speech  as  party  leader  of the  British  zone  at  Cologne  University  in  1946 
where  he  described  orders  of  illiberalism  and  militarism  as  the  character  traits  of  a 
‘Prussian spirit’  which had prepared the seedbed for the rise of National  Socialism.306 He 
used  this  image  to  both  denounce  political  rivals,  in  particular  Schumacher  whom  he 
frequently  accused  of carrying  “the  old  Prussian  spirit”,  and  to  connect  with  the  anti- 
Prussian sentiment prominent among the occupying powers (Schwarz  1986:  514;  Baring 
1969:  53).

304  Despite  declaring  nationalism  ‘the  cancer  of Europe’,  Adenauer was  convinced  that  people 
could not live without what he called a “national sentiment” (Poppinga  1975:  69f).  The problem 
was  not  a  national  consciousness  as  such  but,  rather,  the  sort  of  ‘hypemationalism’  or 
‘aggressive’ nationalism Germans had displayed, see Jarausch (2004: 64-96).
305 This was later captured under the notion of Sonderweg, see Kocka (1982).

Catholic Bavaria and that Hitler himself never was a fan of Prussia.

Envisioning Germany-in-Europe
There  was  consensus  among  political  leaders  in  Germany  that  a  meaningful  vision 
needed to picture German  ‘unity’. On one level this vision was about uniting people and 
territory,  concerned  with  overcoming ‘inner’  borders, that  is,  the  division  into  zones by 
the occupying powers, and with the status of ‘outer’  borders in the West (Ruhr/Saarland) 
and  the  East  (Oder-Neisse).  Yet  because  as  argued  in  chapter  four  space  only  gains 
meaning/value  through  an  understanding  of  what 
the  more 
fundamental question was what kind of order a unified Germany should encompass. And 
because  Germany’s  experienced  space  was  ‘Europe’  and  the  German  question  very 
much a European question, the idea of ‘German’  unity was inevitably entwined with the 
idea of ‘European’ unity.307

is  a  ‘good’  order, 

On the question what Germany and what Europe was to be  ‘united’, Adenauer promoted 
the  idea of a  space which  ensured  individual  rights  and  safeguarded  against militarism. 
Again, these were the cornerstones for post-war ‘Germany’  stated in the Allies’  Potsdam 
agreement,  yet 
In 
they  resonated  with  Christian  values,  which  he  considered 
Adenauer’s  version, 
fundamental 
that  “only 
respect/pursuit of Christian principles is able to save humanity from falling back into the 
worst barbarism and, indeed, safe it from self-destruction” (in Poppinga  1975: 210).

they  were  also  considered  desirable  principles  domestically 

for  orienting 

the  new  Germany-in-Europe  convinced 

The  commitment  to  ‘freedom’  was  a  guiding  theme  in  the  (West)German  political 
discourse throughout the  first decade  and  featured  in  all  of Adenauer’s  statements.  His 
interpretation  of the  ‘freedom’  principle  as  holding  that  all  humans  were  equal  and 
possessed  fundamental  and  inalienable  rights  resonated  with  the  emphasis  in  catholic 
social  theory  placed  on  the  respect  for human  dignity  and  the  intrinsic  value  of human 
life  (Poppinga  1975:  193ff;  Weidenfeld  1976;  Schwarz  1986).  The  draft  of the  party 
program  for  the  newly  founded  Christian  Democrats  in  the  Rhine  region,  written  by 
Adenauer  in  October  1945,  emphasized  that  “the  principles  of  Christian  ethics  and 
culture,  of true democracy must carry and pervade the  life of the  state”,  noting the right 
to  political  and  religious  freedom,  equal  rights  for  all,  protection  of minorities,  etc.  (in 
Schwarz  1986: 496).  Seven of the first twelve Articles of the German Basic, written by a 
cross-partisan  committee  chaired  by  Adenauer,  manifested  the  guarantee  of  personal 
freedoms  as  inalienable  rights  and  emphasised  the  FRG’s  “free  and  democratic  basic 
order”.

die wesentliche  Voraussetzungjedes politischen Anfangs],  see Die Welt,  1946

198

There  also  was  a  profound  commitment to  anti-militarism  in  post-45  German  society, 
which at core really was an anti-war or pacifist sentiment.308 As Konrad Jarausch points 
out,  in  contrast to the heroisation of soldiers  and battles  following the First World  War, 
this time the war experience was portrayed as profoundly negative.  It was not only that 
total  defeat  left  a  feeling  of meaninglessness  about  the  war;  across  the  ranks  it  was 
remembered as “bad times” and “a horrible thing” and there was consensus that the war, 
and  everything that came with  it,  was  an  experience which  “must never happen  again” 
(Jarausch  2004:  47).  This  ‘lesson’  was  formally  manifested  in  the  Occupation  Statute 
from September  1949 where the Adenauer government stated its “firm determination” to 
maintain  the  demilitarization  of  the  new  German  space  and  prevent  the  creation  of 
armed forces (Schroder,  1988:  124).

Values of individual  rights (liberalism) and pacifism (anti-militarism) were combined in 
the  commitment towards  “freedom’  and  peace”  which  Adenauer  constantly  alluded  to 
and  which  together  with  a  commitment to  ‘unity’  was  formally  anchored  in  the  Basic 
Law  and,  in  turn,  inscribed  into  the  European  space.  The  future  of  ‘Germany’  was 
embedded  in  a  vision  of European  order  in  which  peace  would  be  guaranteed  through 
freedom  and  unity.  This was  in  simple yet fundamental  terms the  authentic narrative of 
the  ‘new  Germany’.  Specifically,  for  Adenauer,  European  order  was  captured  in  the 
notion  of  a  ‘United  States  of  Europe’,  an  idea  of  a  federal  union  among  European 
nations  with  an  element  of  supra-nationalism  which  carried  the  promise  of  ‘peace 
through  unity’.  The  vision that  a  united  Europe  would  be  a  formula for  prosperity  and 
peace was central to all conceptions of European order entertained at the time, no matter 
if  formulated  in  religious  (Catholic/Protestant)  or  secular  terms  (socialist/liberal). 
Developed in the  19th century and popular in the  ‘Pan European’  movement in the  1920s 
this  vision  had  lived  on  during the  war  in  the  resistance  and  among exiles.309  After the 
end of the war,  Adenauer participated  in meetings reviving the federal  idea of a ‘United 
States  of Europe’  and  adopted  it  as  a  promising  design,  endorsing  it  in  his  Cologne 
speech in  1946 a few months before Churchill famously did so in Zurich.310

308  This  overlapped  with  the  Allied  objective,  as  Eisenhower  put  it,  to  educate  Germans  to  the 
“self-evident truth” that war was “immoral” (in Jarausch 2004: 41).
309 For a topography laying out the history of the  idea of Europe,  including the United  States  of 
Europe first mentioned by Victor Hugo  in the  19th century,  see  von  Plessel  (2003),  also  Pagden 
(2002). For a discussion of the various ‘Pan-Europe’ groups, see Loth (1991).
310  On  the  development  of the  European  design  in  Adenauer’s thinking,  see  Weidenfeld  (1976: 
47f); Schwarz (1986: 556-563).

199

Not  surprisingly,  for  Adenauer  the  ‘United  States  of  Europe’  was  to  be  a  Christian 
space.  Even before the Vatican  in  1948  officially declared  its  support  for the  federalist 
movement,  Adenauer  at  a  CDU  party  congress  in  August  1947  noted  that  it  was  “the 
Christian  Occident  we  want  to  try  to  rescue”  (in  Schwarz  1986:  564).  Although 
Adenauer’s  appeal  to  Christianity  resonated  with  both  conservatives  and 
liberal- 
progressive parts of German society (Jarausch 2004:  149),  it generated  complaints  from 
Social  Democrats  that  he  was  aiming  at  establishing  a  ‘Vatican  Europe’.311  To  tone 
down this  image in the German public and (once he recognised this) to prevent possible 
tensions with the American suspicion of the catholic faith as a ruling doctrine, Adenauer 
formulated  the  vision  of Europe  as  an  Occidental  or  Western  space.  This  was  not  a 
compromise as, of course, historically the Christian/Occidental/Westem notions blended 
into  each  other  and  were  spatially  confined  to  -   and  arose  out  of -   the  narrative  of 
Europe.312 For Adenauer they all  met in Cologne, which  he once called  “the true centre 
of the Occident” (in  Baring  1969:  50).  He constantly  referred to the  idea of a  ‘Western 
Civilisation’  and  ‘Occident’  interchangeably  as  the  place  within  which  rebuilding 
Germany was to  occur and  committed to  anchor the  vision  of a united  Germany  in  the 
‘Western’  space  through  a  path  of  Westintegration  (Jackson  2006).313  Viewed  from 
Cologne,  the  vision  of  a  Germany-in-Europe  and  of  a  Germany-in-the  West  were 
inseparable,  as  reflected  in  his  inauguration  speech  as  chancellor  in  September  1949 
when  he  claimed  that  Germany  belonged  to  the  “Western  European  world”  (von 
Brentano  1964:  42).

Locating Friends in the West
The above reformulation of the authentic German narrative occurred not in  isolation but 
with  a  significant  Other.  Adenauer  from  1946  onwards  tried  to  connect  with  Western 
occupiers  and  motivate them  to  invest  in  a  ‘new’  Germany-in-Europe  (Schwarz  1986: 
556).  Having  them  shift  the  focus  from  punishment  to  rehabilitation/reconstruction  in 
effect asked for a turn from occupier to friend.

Initially Adenauer hoped that the  idea of Germany in  a  ‘United  States of Europe’  could 
be  engaged  with  France  under  British  leadership  (Foschepoth  1988:  33).  In  his  view

311  While  Schumacher  was  not  very  good  in  formulating  the  European  dimension  of  his 
conception  of ‘Germany’,  other  Social  Democrats  like  Carlo  Schmid  did.  Indeed,  as  Risse  and 
Engelmann-Martin  (2002:  298)  point out,  the  Heidelberger  Programm  from  1925  embraced  the 
notion of a ‘United States of Europe’ making the SPD the first major German party to do so.
312 Said (1976); Coker (1998); Neumann (1999); Pagden (2002).
3,3  Critics  (then  and  now)  accuse  Adenauer  of being  content  with  a  divided  Germany,  while 
sympathisers hold that his strategy of Westintegration was  designed to attract and  ‘pull  over’  the 
Eastern part. My reading supports the latter. On the debate, see Foschepoth (1988); Loth (1994)

200

Britain  still  was  an  empire and  had  proven  a reasonable occupier to work with  after the 
First  World  War.  Adenauer was  also  sensitive to the  fact that  reinventing  Germany-in- 
Europe  required  redefining  the  relationship  with  France.  Indeed,  when  noting  that 
building  a  ‘United  States  of  Europe’  promised  “the  best,  safest,  and  most  enduring 
protection  of  Germany’s  Western  neighbours”  (Schwarz  1986:  515),  the  neighbour 
Adenauer  had  particularly  in  mind  was  France.  Having  spent  his  life  close  to  French 
border and aware of the marks which conflicts over designs of being-in-Europe had  left 
in  both  biographies,  French-German  reconciliation  in  a  new  ‘Europe’  became  a  key 
theme  in  his  speeches,  noting  in  October  1948  that “The  whole future  of Europe  relies 
on  a real  and  lasting  accommodation/understanding  [Verstandigung]  between  Germany 
and France” (in Poppinga,  1975:  68).

However,  neither  Paris  nor  London  were  ready  to  invest  in  a  project  which,  in 
Adenauer’s  view,  provided  a  desirable  ‘home’.  In  the  French  and  British  experience, 
Germany  remained  a  notorious  aggressor,  an  image they  had  no  reasons  to  dispose  of 
anytime  soon.  Busy  with  their  own  recovery,  they  were  not  inclined  to  give  Germany 
hope  for  quick  rehabilitation.  In  France,  the  German  narrative  was  not  open  for 
negotiation.  Humiliated  in  the  war  and  struggling with  re-establishing  its  own  political 
life  after  the  split  between  resistance  and  collaboration,  for  France  a  rehabilitation  of 
Germany  would  have  meant  giving  up  demands  on  the  Saar  and  Ruhr  regions, 
significant not only economically but also for the French  status as the victorious nation. 
As  such,  French  politicians  were  more  interested  in  strengthening ties  with  Britain  and 
the US.  While the British did not dismiss the idea of ‘civilising’  Germany, this would be 
a slow process which  it could be embark upon only after paying appropriately. Although 
the  Churchill  government,  in  particular  Anthony  Eden,  had  a  more  positive  view  of 
Adenauer than the Labour government under Atlee -  the Foreign Office  in  1948  named 
Adenauer  a  “dangerous  man”  (Schwarz  1986:  592)  -   there  was  little  enthusiasm  in 
London  about  investing  in the vision  of a united  Europe.  Apart from  despising the  idea 
of  ‘Vatican  Europe’  (Lundestad  1998:  30),  Britain  did  not  see  herself as  living  in  a 
shared  European  space,  or  only  as  a  detached  balancer,  and  was  primarily  oriented 
towards Washington and its (fading) empire.314

That neither Paris nor London were willing to conceive of Germany as a creative partner 
for the spatial reorganization of their post-war world became apparent in the creation of

3,4  The  difference  between  these  spaces  was  famously  captured  in  the  three  circles  which 
Churchill  sketched  for Adenauer  in  1951,  positioning  Britain  at the  intersection  of an  Atlantic 
space with the US, the Commonwealth and Europe (Trachtenberg,  1999:  116).

the  ‘Brussels  Pact’  in  March  1948  (which  the North  Atlantic  Treaty  later  built  on  and 
which, ironically, was to play a crucial role for eventually allowing German membership 
in NATO).  It built on the Anglo-French  Dunkirk Treaty  from  March  1947,  formalizing 
the war-time alliance (Baylis,  1984).  While the Dunkirk Treaty was accompanied  by the 
idea  of a  European  ‘third  force’  (Loth  1991:  34-40),  its  primary  aim  was  resisting  any 
possible  future  German  aggression  (Baylis  1984:  618).  When  the  Benelux  countries 
joined a year later, making it the  ‘Brussels Pact’, the anti-German focus was toned down 
but the explicit commitment of resisting a  ‘renewal of German policy of aggression’  was 
maintained.315  While  not excluding the  possibility that Germany would  eventually join, 
it  was  not  considered  to  partake  in  actively  shaping  the  ‘Western  Union’,  at  least  not 
until, as Ernest Bevin noted in January  1948, “circumstances permitted” (in Baylis  1984: 
620).  The  Brussels  agreement thus  lacked  a decisive  promise that the  space  negotiated 
through  them  was  to  include  Germany  in  positive  terms,  it  certainly  did  not  cater  to 
Adenauer’s  vision  of  recreating  a  Germany  at  the  ‘heart’  of  Europe.  Aware  of  how 
deeply  Germany’s  ‘Prussian’  image  was  entrenched  in  France  and  Britain,  Adenauer 
realised that overcoming their reservations and envisioning a new Germany as an ‘equal’ 
would take a long time (Poppinga  1975:  108).

The US position appeared different. While until late  1948 Adenauer had little knowledge 
about  the  workings  of  US  politics  and  had  difficulties  grasping  its  direction,  he 
recognised the US potential  for the renewal o f ‘Germany-in-Europe’  early on (Schroder 
1988:  123).316 In March  1946 Adenauer wrote a colleague in the US to help convince the 
government “that the  rescue  of Europe  can  only  succeed  with  help  from  the  USA”  and 
that  such  a  rescue  would  also  be  “elementary”  [wesentlich]  for the  US  (Schwarz  1986: 
564).  Even prior to the  Marshall  Plan, when  it was not yet clear how the US  would  use 
its  resources,  across  party  lines  the  US  attitude  towards  Germany  appeared  more 
benevolent than Britain’s, that is,  it appeared more willing to support a reconstruction of 
Germany-in-Europe (Foschepoth  1997:  83ff).317

315  French-British  insistence to  keep the anti-German  clause may  in  part  have been  a strategy to 
ensure Moscow that the Pact was not directed against the Soviet Union (Baylis  1984; Loth  1991: 
65f.). In any case, the Pact was envisioned by Bevin as “a sort of spiritual federation of the West” 
aimed not at integrating Germany but at strengthening US engagement in Europe (cited in Baylis 
1984: 620).  More precisely, the aim was to win the US as a member of the Western Union and to 
satisfy  US  demands  for better cooperation  in  Western  Europe.  It did not endorse the vision  of a 
‘new’ Germany (Ibid; Kaplan  1984: 59f; Loth  1991: 63f; Winand  1994:  18).
316 On Adenauer’s relationship with the US, see the contributions in Schwabe (1994). As Schwarz 
(1986:  656)  points  out,  Adenauer’s  understanding  of the  US  and  its  politics  sharpened  only  in 
1948 with the choice of Herbert Blankenhom, an experienced diplomat, as his advisor.
3,7  The  positive  perception  of the  US  was  also  visible  amongst  the  general  population.  It  was 
aided by the fact that the America-image was underdeveloped and romanticized in Germany, and

202

An  important  sign  was  the  speech  given  by  James  Byrnes  in  Stuttgart  in  September 
1946,  the  first  public  speech  by  a  Secretary  of State  in  the  destroyed  Germany.  In this 
speech,  Byrnes  basically  used  the  principles  of the  Potsdam  Agreement  to  shift  the 
agenda  from  punishment  to  rehabilitation.  From  the  German  perspective,  the  speech 
offered  a vision  of a better future  in three  ways.  First,  it  identified  the  interrelationship 
between  ‘Germany’  and  ‘Europe’  and,  noting that  German  resources  must  be  used  “to 
rebuild  a  free,  peaceful  Germany  and  a  free,  peaceful  Europe”  explicitly  connects  the 
future  well-being  of  Germany  with  that  of  ‘Europe’.  Second, 
it  confirmed  the 
commitment  of the  Potsdam  Agreement  that  Germany  should  be  administered  as  an 
economic  unit  which,  while  falling  short  of formulating  the  aim  of German  political 
unity,  holds  the  promise  that  zonal  barriers  would  not  be  entrenched.  Third,  and  most 
significantly,  Byrnes  called  for a “successful  rehabilitation  of Germany”,  not restricted 
to the  economic realm  but connected to  “setting  up  a  democratic  German government” 
and  drafting  a  constitution  for  a  “new  Germany”.  While  reminding Germans that  they 
were bearing the responsibility for their current situation, he closed his speech by saying

“the  United  States  has  no  desire to  increase  those  hardships  or to  deny 
the  German  people  an  opportunity  to  work  their  way  out  of  those 
hardships (...) The American people want to help the German people to 
win  their  way  back  to  an  honorable  place  among  the  free  and  peace- 
loving nations of the world”.318

The  speech  was  received  very  positively,  with  German  newspapers  commenting  that 
Byrnes  had  opened  a  “door  of  hope”  through  which  “a  friend  and  helper  showed 
Germans  the  way  to  a  new  life”  (cited  in  Jarausch  2004:  150).  The  next  few  years 
confirmed  the  American  support  for  the  creation  of  a  ‘new’  Germany  and  gave 
Adenauer the sense not only of US strength but also of direction.  In his inaugural speech 
as  chancellor  in  September  1949  he  noted:  “I  don’t  think  ever  in  history  a  victorious 
country tried to assist the defeated country in such  a way, and  [tried] to contribute to  its 
reconstruction  and  its  recovery  like  the  United  States  did  and  [still]  does  towards 
Germany” (cited  in  Schroder  1988:  118).  In a Bundestag speech  in October that year he 
emphasised  Germany’s  “great  luck  that  the  American  people  are  freedom-loving, 
progressive,  and  determined”  (cited  in  Schroder,  1988:  123).  Adenauer  celebrated 
American  determinism because  it  invested  in  a vision of Germany-in-Europe  he shared. 
As  Rainer  Barzel  puts  it  in  basic  terms,  his  positive  view  of the  US  was  based  on  a

so the disclosure of ‘America’  in a post-war world through  interaction with  friendly US  soldiers 
and an influx of US popular culture had tremendous impact, see Jarausch (2004:  148ff).

feeling that “these are people who want the order which I strive towards as well” (Barzel 
in  Schwabe  1994:  61), as expressed in Adenauer’s comment at a CDU party congress in 
August  1947 that “the  Occident,  the  Christian  Occident,  is  not a geographic term,  it  is  a 
spiritual-historical  term  which  also  encompasses  America”  (in  Schwarz  1986:  564). 
How  this  space  looked  from  Washington  and  why  Germany  was  treated  favourably  in 
there is discussed next.

America-in-the-World: Shaping the West
Adenauer’s  framing  of the  European  project  as  crucial  for  re-instating  the  values  of 
‘Western civilization’  resonated  in  Washington.  ‘The  West’  was the value  space within 
which  the  American  narrative  unfolded.  It  was  forged  through  detachment  from  the 
European continent and the Westward-movement of ‘manifest destiny’, creating a space 
that  was  not  ‘Europe’  but  still  linked  to  it  through  common  roots  in  enlightenment 
values.  The  overarching  ordering  principle  defining  this  space,  and  to  which  the 
existence  of America-in-the-West  was  tied,  was  ‘liberty’  or  ‘freedom’  (Foner  2003). 
Expressed  in the notion of American exceptionalism, this space and the order it contains 
was  considered  a  space  for  human  progress  and  the  promise  of a  better  future,  quite 
literally  a  ‘New  World’.  The  identification  of  America  as  an  exceptional  nation 
unfolding  in  the  Western  space  generated  the  self-understanding  of  ‘America’  as  the 
defender  of  ‘the  West’,  a  reading  becoming  visible  in  the  Monroe  doctrine  and 
manifested  with  the  First  World  War as  a  foreign  policy  principle  (Coker,  1998;  Gress 
1998;  Jackson  2006).319  Freedom  was  the  principle  grounding  Henry  Luce’s  1941 
famous  formulation  of the  authentic  American  narrative,  and  as  Dean  Acheson  noted, 
the  line  of American  foreign  policy  was  to  be  “the  constructive  task  of  building,  in 
cooperation with others, the kind of world  in which freedom...can flourish. The success 
of our  efforts  rests  on  our  faith  in  ourselves  and  in  the  values  for  which  this  Republic 
stands” (Acheson  1950:  10).

In spite of George Washington’s famous call not to become entangled with  ‘Europe’, the 
two  World  Wars  (re)integrated  ‘Europe’  into  America’s  experienced  space,  ‘the  West’. 
The  signing of the Atlantic Charter by Roosevelt and Churchill  in August  1941  is often 
referred to as a symbolic revival of the West as an Anglo-American sphere (Coker  1998, 
Ch. 2; Gress  1998).320 The Charter was not merely a declaration of military solidarity but

319  Leffler  calls  the  emphasis  of the  US  military  establishment  to  predominate  throughout  the 
Western  Hemisphere “a natural  evolution of the Monroe Doctrine”, see  Leffler (1984: 354f.). On 
American exceptionalism and missionary  ideology, see Blanke and Krakau (1992).
320 Christopher Coker calls the  Charter the product of “a heightened consciousness of the  values 
of Western  civilization”  and  suggests that the  idea of an  “Atlantic  world”  came  from  Churchill

204

captured a political  project whose purpose  it was  but to  lay out the  vision of a peaceful 
(potentially  global)  post-war  order  around  the  principles  of sovereignty,  political  and 
economic  liberalism  and  denouncing  military  aggression.321  It  makes  no  reference  to  a 
geopolitical space, however, because the American vision differed from the British when 
it  came  to  specifying  ‘the  world’  it  should  apply  to.  Most  importantly,  there  was 
disagreement as to what extent the idea of a united Europe was, or should be, part of ‘the 
West’.  As  symbolised  in  Churchill’s  three  circles,  the  British  imagined  the  West  more 
narrowly  as  an  Anglo-American  ‘Atlantic  world’,  a  space  separate  not  only  from  the 
British  Empire  but  also  from  ‘Europe’.  Investment  in  the  ‘West’  and  ‘Europe’  were 
considered two different and potentially conflicting projects (Coker  1998).

From  Washington  things  looked  different.  The  initial  tension  between  the  Truman 
doctrine’s  global  outlook and  a regional  focus  on  Europe  gave way to the  latter.  While 
universalism  remained  visible  in  the  Truman  and  Eisenhower  administrations  (Gaddis 
2005:  55),  ‘Europe’  took  a  privileged  place  in  the  American  conception  of the  world. 
When  Kennan  convinced  Washington  in  1946  that  views  held  in  the  Kremlin  were 
irreconcilable  with  the  idea  of  ‘one  world’  and  that  ‘two  spheres  of  influence’  were 
emerging  in  Europe  (Trachtenberg  1999),  US  planners  saw  Europe  and,  within  it, 
Germany, as  the place whose  horizon of expectations needed to be  kept in  line with  the 
American  one.  By  the  time  Marshall  noted  in  June  1947  that  the  US  was  “one  of the 
bulwarks of Western  civilization” and would not “stand  by and  watch the disintegration 
of the  international  community to which  we belong” (in Jackson, 2003:  244), the future 
of ‘Europe’  had become central to the future of the Western space.

Envisioning the  *United States of Europe’
It  is  useful  to  being with the  reminder that  American  designs for post-war Europe were 
not primarily responding to a perceived  Soviet threat but aimed at addressing the causes 
of the  war,  namely  preventing  a  resurgence  of rivalry  and  turmoil  (Ikenberry  2001: 
170ff;  Layne  2006:  43f).  Yet  from  a  phenomenological  perspective  the  American 
motivation for becoming engaged  in  Europe was not merely to create a  ‘zone of peace’ 
(McArdle  Kelleher,  1983),  but  a particular  peace,  one  which  provided  the  US  with 
authentic  ontological  security.  The  point  made  here  is  that,  in  contrast  to  explanations 
stressing  pure  economic  motives  (securing  a  new  market)  or  a  traditional  security 
rationale  (deterrence  against  Soviet  aggression),  from  a  national  biography  perspective

(Coker  1998: 32). The  idea certainly resonated with  Roosevelt who in his  ‘four freedoms’  speech 
from January  1941  had outlined the values the US sought to defend  (Kissinger,  1994: 385-391).
321 The principles were echoed in the Potsdam agreement and the UN Charter.

205

the  US  investment  in  ‘Europe’  was  aimed  at  positively  integrating  this  space  into  the 
American  narrative.  And  as  suggested  by  the  friendship  lens,  US  policymakers  were 
looking for pursuing this task through a special relationship.

Trachtenberg’s  observation  of an  American  desire  “to  pull  out  (of Europe)  as  soon  as 
she reasonably could” (cited  in McAllister 2002:  19) may be true where the stationing of 
troops was  concerned.  Yet on  a more fundamental  level the US needed (and wanted) to 
remain  engaged  simply  because  ‘Europe’  could  not  be  pulled  out  of  the  American 
biography.  ‘Europe’  had  become spatially  integrated in  into the American understanding 
of ‘being-in-the-world’.  Once this space  had  been  disclosed  and  made  part of the  world 
through  the  experience  of the  war,  America could  not  disengage  from  the  memory  but 
had to make it meaningful. From that perspective, the geopolitical argument why Europe 
mattered  popular  among  strategic  analysts  at  the  time,  building  on  the  conviction  that 
“who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world” (see Leffler,  1984:  fn  30),322 was 
informed  less  by  a  realist  (balance  of power)  mindset  than  by  the  view  that  a  strong 
Europe  within  the  West  would  vitalize  America’s  vision  for  and  unfolding  in  ‘the 
world’.323  The  aim  was to  integrate  Europe  for a creative  project which  accommodated 
American  ideas  of  order  and  was  supported  by  European  nations  thereby  satisfying 
desires of both  belonging/recognition  and  authenticity.  As Kennan  put  it  in the  summer 
of 1949, without ‘Europe’ the US would be “a lonely nation... in the sense of philosophy 
and outlook on the world” (cited  in Winand  1994:  15).

It  is  suggested  here  that  the  vision  of ‘Europe’  in  which  the  Truman  and  Eisenhower 
administration  invested  resonated  with  the  one  Adenauer  pursued,  namely  that  of  a 
regional  federal  order,  a  ‘United  States  of  Europe’.  Yet  whereas  the  Chancellor’s 
support for this design is well known, the American position requires some elaboration.

As  Pascaline  Winand  (1993)  and  Geir  Lundestad  (1998)  have  shown,  the  US  was  a 
strong supporter of the idea of European integration from the start. One scholar has even 
spoken of an American “obsession with Western European unity” (McAllister 2002:  17). 
In  addition  to  the  paramount theme  of creating  ‘peace  through freedom ’  present  in  all

322 For a comprehensive revisionist discussion of the American  ‘national security interest’  at the 
time,  including the view prevailing among strategists that “any power(s) attempting to dominate 
Eurasia must be regarded as potentially hostile to the United States”, see Leffler (1984: 456ff.).
323 In a speech emphasizing the importance of defending ‘freedom’, Acheson noted how millions 
of people  in Europe were looking for a way out of misery and that “if we want them to move in 
the direction  of freedom, we must help them” because “those who think  like  us  should have the 
power to  make  safe  the  area  in  which  we  carry  that  faith  [in  freedom]  into  action”  (Acheson 
1950: 4f.).

key speeches of US  officials, the administration  invested heavily  in the vision o f ‘peace 
through  unity'.  In  Washington  the  idea  of  a  ‘unified’  Europe  was  discussed  already 
during the war, with reports on how to best organize economic aid highlighting a region- 
specific  design  with  Germany  at  the  centre  (Winand  1993:  7-14).  Like  Adenauer,  US 
planners  and  policymakers  were  exposed  to  the  idea  by  advocates  of  a  European 
federation,  including Monnet.324 The  idea of a  ‘United  States of Europe’  was prominent 
also  in  the  State  Department  and  favourably  debated  in  the  press  and  on  Capitol  Hill 
through  groups  such the  ‘American  Committee for a Free  and  United  Europe’  (Winand 
1994:  19ff).  After initial concerns that such an approach would compromise the idea of 
free  trade,  the  Truman  administration  since  late  1945  set  course  for  the  economic 
reconstruction o f ‘Europe’  and developed institutions were not just to distribute aid most 
efficiently,  but  to  install  the  kind  of European  order  of  ‘freedom’  and  ‘unity’  the  US 
deemed worth investing in.325

Rather  than  dismissing  the  popularity  of the  ‘United  States  of Europe’  vision  as  mere 
rhetoric,  as  Kaplan  (1984;  1994)  seems  to  suggest,  the  argument  here  is  that  it  was 
fundamental  for  how  Washington  rationalized  and justified  its  engagement  in/with  the 
European  space.  Turning  Europe  into  a  ‘free  and  unified’  space  in  a  design  familiar to 
Americans  provided  US  policymakers  with  an  opportunity  to  productively  integrate 
‘Europe’  into America’s world.  In other words, the reason the vision of a  ‘United  States 
of Europe’  was  adopted  was that  it resonated  with the  American  biography.  Just as the 
Founding Fathers had  introduced the federal constitution as a solution to make unity out 
of diversity, and just as the American Civil War had been turned  into a creative force to 
‘unify’  Americans,  so  the  ‘European  civil  war’  could  be  turned  into  unity  under  the 
federal  design.  It was  a  foundational  moment; the  federal  union  had  brought peace  and 
prosperity to America and the  ‘United  States of Europe’  would  do the same for Europe. 
This was the theme of Carl Van  Doren’s widely read  ‘Great Rehearsal’  and was echoed 
by  Congressmen  and  administration  officials  in  frequent  lectures  to  Europeans  on  the 
importance  of these  American  lessons.  As one  British  Foreign  Office official  remarked 
(in frustration) “the Americans want an  integrated Europe  looking like the United States 
of America -   ‘God’s  own  country’”  (in  Kaplan  1984:  131,  60f;  1994:  18f.;  Lundestad 
1998:  15).

324 According to  Winand,  Monnet had  strong bonds with  key  American  officials  such  as  Dulles 
and  Kennan  and  inspired  their  pro-European  stance  (Winand  1994:  2fi),  as  was  Coudenhove- 
Kalergi  for  Fulbright.  For  a  more  sceptical  perspective  of the  influence  of these  figures,  see 
Kaplan (1984: 52-58).
325  Most  famously  to  ‘oversee’  the  European  Recovery  Program  (‘Marshall  Plan’)  through  the 
Economic  Cooperation  Administration  (ECA)  and  administered  through  the  Organisation  for 
European Economic Co-Operation (OEEC).

207

Investing  in  this  vision,  then,  had  significant  payoffs:  It  accommodated  a  vision  of 
‘Europe’  within  the  Western  space  and  it  reduced  the  possibility  of renewed  conflict 
based  on  the  dual  belief that  (i)  a  liberal  and  federal  order  had  an  intrinsic  pacifying 
effect  and  that  (ii)  a  society  striving  for an  order built along the  lines  of the  American 
model  would  be  a  ‘natural’  partner.  In  the  belief that  ‘all  good  things  go  together’  the 
vision  of a  ‘united  Europe’  reduced  uncertainty  by  holding the  promise  of a  recovered 
and peaceful  Germany-in-Europe  siding with the US.  This trust that a  ‘United  States of 
Europe’  would  be a peaceful and reliable partner explains why influential voices in both 
Truman and  Eisenhower administrations were not worried  about and,  indeed,  supported 
the  idea of a  ‘third  force’  under the  assumption that “as that third  force,  Europe  would 
most often  side  with  the  United  States”  (Winand  1994:  15;  Trachtenberg  1999).326  The 
vision  of a  ‘third  force’  benevolent  to  the  US  provided  the  perfect  balance  between 
ensuring  a  strong  link  between  the  US  and  ‘Europe’  without  becoming  formally 
‘entangled’, thus not departing from George Washington’s dictum entirely.

Rebuilding Germany
One  could  ask  whether  ‘Germany’  mattered  to  the  US  because  of  its  concern  for 
‘Europe’,  or  vice  versa.  From  a  phenomenological  perspective  this  distinction  makes 
little sense. As noted earlier, Hitler’s policies connected the two  in the experience of the 
participants  and  victims  in  that  war  and  rendered  it  impossible  to  conceive  of  one 
(‘Europe’)  without  the  other  (‘Germany’).327  Thus,  the  task  of  ordering  Europe 
inevitably included the task of ordering Germany. As Tony Judt points out, 85 percent of 
American  war  effort  had  gone  on  the  war against  Germany  (Judt  2005:  105)  and  so  it 
was not the ‘Soviet question’  but the ‘German question’  which stood at the centre of US 
post-war planning and informed the broader question how to order ‘Europe’:  “the central 
question  of  the  postwar  world  was  and  would  remain  the  future  of  Germany” 
(McAllister 2002: 4).  Even when  it was not always stated Germany was the “major issue 
in  every  meeting of the  Allies  and  in  most of the  planning  sessions  within  the  United 
States”  (Kaplan  1984:  3;  Lundestad,  1998;  Gortemaker,  1994:  76;  Trachtenberg,  1999;

326  Republican  Presidential  candidates  Thomas  Dewey  in  April  1948  asserted  that  “what  is 
needed to restore stability in the world is a unified Europe -  a strong third power devoted to the 
cause  of peace.  What  is  needed  is  a  United  States  of Europe”  (in  Kaplan  1984:  71,  emphasis

from  within 

that 

The analytical  lens used here does not follow the common portrayal of the US engaging 
in  a  “struggle  over” or even  “for”  Germany (McAllister 2002),  which  reduces  ‘it’  to  a 
prize  fought  over  by  the  victorious  powers.  Instead,  it  was  about  an  investment  in 
Germany-in-Europe  with  Adenauer.  This  perspective  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  in 
discussions  of what  to  do  with  Germany  after  the  war  the  ‘punishment’  agenda  was 
abandoned  relatively  quickly.  Proposals  such  as  those  advanced  by  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  Henry  Morgenthau  which  recommended  stripping  Germany  of  its  industrial 
capacity  and  turning  it  de facto  into  an  agricultural  society  were  discarded.  Although 
Roosevelt initially leaned towards German punishment,  in  September  1944 he distanced 
himself from  the  Morgenthau  Plan  in  the  face  of opposition  from  Congress,  the  press 
and 
such  measures  were 
counterproductive for achieving Tasting peace’  in Europe. Directive  1067 from the Joint 
Chiefs  of  Staff,  presented  to  Truman  in  April  1945  calling  for  treating  occupied 
Germany  as  “a  defeated  enemy  nation”  faced  similar  criticism  and  faded  in  the 
implementation  phase  (Winand,  1993:  7;  Judt  2005:  105).  Neither  was  Washington’s 
approach  towards  Germany  simply  about  containment,  as  suggested  most  prominently 
by Gaddis (2005;  also  Hanrieder  1989).  While the  aim  clearly was to  prevent a similar 
Germany  from  re-emerging,  if  ‘containment’  is  understood  as  ‘keeping  the  Germans 
down’  the  term  is  misleading.  From  Byrnes’  speech  to  the  Marshall  Plan  to  Acheson’s 
note that the US was “giving the Germans a goal to work as  partners with other Western 
countries” (in  Kaplan  1984:  6),  US  policy towards  Germany  is  better captured  in terms 
o f ‘recreation’.

the  administration,  who  argued 

Recognising  the  importance  of  Walter  Lippmann’s  insight  in  1944  that  a  peaceable 
Germany “must have  a place  somewhere”  (in  Harper  1994:  186),  the  aim  was  to  place 
the  ‘new’  Germany  firmly  in,  and  have  it  contribute  to  America’s  conception  of  ‘the 
West’.  Conceiving  of  and  representing  Germany  as  such  a  positive  force  was  not 
difficult.  Whereas the two wars had made it part of America’s experienced  space,  other 
than  France  and  Britain  the  US  lacked  the  trauma from  German  aggression.  Thus,  the 
US biography did not need to accommodate a ‘Germany’ which had brought destruction, 
suffering and/or occupation to the American  ‘homeland’. The number of American  lives 
lost  in the war was below that suffered  by most European  nations and the war itself had 
strengthened,  rather than  weakened,  the  US  economy.  When  Acheson  spoke  about  the 
difference between the American,  French  and  British  policies on  post-war Germany,  he 
noted “I suppose that it is a result of the depth of the historical background, the emotions 
and the passions that have been aroused by Germany’ aggressive wars and the inevitable 
importance  attached  to  the  course  of German  development”  (Acheson  1950:  118).  As

209

Lawrence  Kaplan  (1984:  25)  notes,  whereas  French  memories  made  it  impossible  to 
accept  Germans  as  “colleagues  in  a  common  effort”,  the  US  had  no  problems 
rehabilitating  Germany  and  channelling  reparation  payments  into  a  common  project. 
Building on the theme of redemption  in the American narrative and the  right to have  ‘a 
second  chance’,  the  view,  as  expressed  in  aforementioned  Byrnes’  speech,  was  that 
Germans were capable and could be assisted to do better.  In short, they were considered 
capable of living the American Dream.328

The  State  Department  was  explicit  in  that  Germany’s  new  place  had  to  be  defined 
together with Germans (Maier  1990:  33;  Acheson  1950).  Kennan,  in  particular, came to 
recognise that German public opinion would never give up on the idea of unification and 
that a divided Germany de-facto meant a divided  Europe and  so, after initial  scepticism, 
adopted  the  ideal  of German  unity.  However,  the  administration  shared  with  Adenauer 
the assessment that there was “a gap between the desirable and the practicable” (Gaddis 
2005:  72f.).  So  Kennan’s  proposal  from  November  1948  to  aim  towards  a  unified 
Germany was  dropped  by Acheson  due to  anticipated  French  and  British  opposition  to 
seeing  Germany  ‘restored’,  Russian  unwillingness  to  withdraw  its  troops,  and  the 
concern that a united Germany could  slip  into the  Soviet zone of influence (the  ‘Rapallo 
complex’,  see below).  Instead, the idea was formed, found in more general terms in NSC 
68,  to  build  up  a  West  German  state  which  would  serve  as  a  magnet  and  ‘attract’  the 
Eastern  part, thus pursuing the idea of German unity through a  ‘politics of strength’, the 
path Adenauer embraced.

NATO as a Forum  for Building ‘Europe’
The signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in April  1949 and the commitment of solidarity 
it contained is considered a milestone in the history of a United  States traditionally wary 
of becoming entangled  in European affairs.  Yet in contrast to the portrayal  of NATO as 
an  institutionalization  of deterrence/containment,  the  lens  used  here  suggests  that  the 
primary purpose  of NATO  was  not the  military defense  of Western  Europe’s territorial 
integrity.  Neither  was 
Ikenberry  (2001)  suggests,  for  making  American 
preponderance  “acceptable”  to  Europeans  by  setting  up  power  sharing  institutions. 
Instead,  the  argument  here  is  that  that  the  US  sought  an  institutional  frame  through

it,  as 

328 On the theme of redemption ism  in US foreign policy, see Coker (1989:  11-20).  Indicative for 
American faith in German  ‘learning abilities’ were the various re-education programmes targeted 
towards  instilling  a  ‘democratic  consciousness’  and  war  as  a  morally  bad  thing.  This  was 
supported  by  the  view  that  Germans  were  not  inherently  evil  but,  for the  most  part,  had  been 
‘misguided’  by  Hitler and  his  regime.  On  ‘re-education’  programmes,  see Jarausch  (2004).  The 
fact  that  about  30%  of Americans  claimed  German  heritage,  making  it  the  largest  immigrant 
group, in all  likelihood also contributed to the hope in a ‘better’  Germany.

210

which  it could build  a  ‘United  States  of Europe’  within the Western  space.  For this, the 
economic  institutions  set  up  around  the  Marshall  Plan  were  not  sufficient.  Given  the 
highly  militarized  environment  after  the  war  and  the  vivid  memories  of  German 
aggression a new European order required an institution dealing with the question of the 
legitimate  use  of force.  It  is  argued  here  that NATO  came to  be  that  institution  which 
allowed  creatively  integrating,  together  with  Germany,  the  European  space 
into 
America’s  national  biography.  Thus,  In  addition  to  “breaking  down  the  barriers  of 
national  sovereignty...that  were  held  responsible  for  much  of  the  disasters  of  the 
twentieth century” (Kaplan  1984:  5), NATO was to create the conditions for setting up a 
‘United States of Europe’  containing a strong and friendly Germany.

To be  sure,  Washington was  wary of British  and  French  attempts to  have to  commit to 
an  extended  ‘Western  Union’.  As  symbolized  in  the  debate  over  the  terms  of mutual 
solidarity  and  what  was  to  become  Article  five  of the  North  Atlantic  Treaty,  the  US 
administration was  unsure about the  institution’s purpose or,  more precisely,  about how 
the  US  would  benefit  from  it  (Kaplan  1984:  113ff).  Pentagon  and  State  Department 
were concerned for different reasons. The former was wary of over-commitment, that is, 
of  promising  military  assistance  to  weak  European  forces  without  a  clear  military 
rationale  and  ambiguous  statements  of  purpose,  and  of  investing  in  what  might  be 
perceived  as  a  military  provocation  by the  Soviet Union  (Ibid.,  69f.).  This  last concern 
was shared by diplomats, who in addition were worried that a formal US commitment of 
military  solidarity was  undermining the  idea of a European  ‘third  force’.  Both  branches 
had  a  feeling  that  by joining  an  extended  Western  Union  the  US  would  be  asked  to 
commit over proportion in military and political terms.

Yet  given  the  weakness  of Europeans,  the  feeling  of a  lacking  reciprocity  was  less  a 
matter of correcting the  balance  in  terms  of means  supplied,  it was  a question  of ends. 
For  Kennan  and  John  Hickerton,  director  of the  Office  for  Western  European  Affairs, 
the Brussels Pact was  ‘too negative’, that is, at root still a military alliance which treated 
Germany as a potential enemy and was not politically advancing the project of European 
unity.  This was also Truman’s view.  In his congratulating remarks on the  signing of the 
Brussels  Pact,  Truman  attempted  to  shift  the  focus  by  emphasizing  the  potential  of a 
united Europe and embedding his support in the view that the treaty was “a notable step 
in the direction of unity  in  Europe for protection and preservation  of its civilization” (in 
Kaplan  1984:  66).

211

The administration eventually engaged negotiations because it saw this as an investment 
in the project of a free and united Europe and hoped to thereby move closer to its vision 
of a  Western  space  promising  a  meaningful  future  in  peace.  When  Acheson  in  March 
1949 explained the meaning of the North Atlantic Pact in a radio address, he stressed  its 
purpose to  be the  defence  of Western  civilisation,  “the  product  of at  least  350  years  of 
history”  connecting  the  US  with  Western  Europe  fundamentally  through  “common 
institutions and moral and ethical beliefs... acceptance of the same values in  life”. Yet he 
portrayed  it  not  merely  as  a  conservative  institution.  Behind  the  characterisation  of the 
Pact  as  a  “self-defense  arrangement”  Acheson  emphasised  its  creative  function  of 
‘waging  peace’  understood  as  creating  “an  environment  of freedom,  from  which  flows 
the  greatest  amount  of  ingenuity,  enterprise,  and  accomplishment”  (Acheson  1950: 
82ff.).

Because the federal idea and German rehabilitation in it were cornerstones of this vision, 
the US tied  its signing of North Atlantic Treaty to concessions from  Britain  and France. 
The former had to accept the dilution of the Atlantic space by recognising the US plan to 
merge the  Western  and  the  European  space  and  France  had  to  accept  that  the  US  was 
disinclined  to  create  the  West  as  a  space  in  which  Germany  would  be  discriminated 
against.  Still,  debates  over  membership,  spatial  terminology  (‘Western’,  ‘Europe’ 
‘Atlantic’)  and  the  precise  meaning  and  formulation  of  Article  Five  highlighted  that 
disagreements remained about the common project (Kaplan  1984).

Adenauer’s  Germany turned  out to  be  the  ideal  partner.  The  American  plan  to  recreate 
Germany  by  integrating  it  into  a  ‘united  Europe’  within  the  Western  space  resonated 
with  Adenauer’s  path  of Westintegration  and  vice  versa.  The  resonance  of Adenauer’s 
thinking  with  both  Truman  and  Eisenhower  administrations  concerning  the  future  of 
‘Germany-in-Europe’  was  so  strong  that  already  prior  to  his  election  as  chancellor 
Adenauer was described by a high ranking American civil administrator in Bonn as “our 
man”  (in  Schwarz  1986:  591).329  During  his  first  visit  to  the  US  in  1953,  great  efforts 
were  made  by  the  Americans  to  provide  Adenauer  with  backing  for  the  upcoming 
elections,  with Dulles even noting at a press conference that  it would  be “disastrous”  if 
he  was  not  re-elected.  From  an  American  perspective  Adenauer  was  considered  so 
important  for the  direction  of Germany that after  his  re-election  in  1953,  the  US  High 
Commission  in  an  assessment of his  first  term  was  not  worried  about  the  fact  that  his 
autocratic  governing  style  but  that  there  was  ‘stagnation’  in  public  support  for  his

212

politics  (Schroder  1988:  134-38).  Ironically,  the  reason  for  this  ‘stagnation’  was  that 
Adenauer  had  decided  that  the  FRG  needed  to  adapt  a  core  principle  of  its  (young) 
narrative to be able to negotiate its future in the West with the US.

Rearmament as Voice
Adenauer  was  convinced  that  German  participation  in  the  US  effort  of  shaping  the 
Western  space  would  require  NATO  membership.  This  would  bring  recognition  as  an 
‘equal  partner’  entitled  and  expected  to  help  developing  Germany-in-Europe.  Hence, 
even  before  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  was  signed  and  his  election  as  Chancellor, 
Adenauer noted  in March  1949 that membership in NATO was “one of the first tasks of 
a West German government” (Baring  1969:  73).  Aware of the American expectation for 
reciprocity,  that  is,  strong  voices  coming  out  of  the  US  Congress  binding  US 
engagement in Europe on corresponding European contributions,330 Adenauer needed to 
find a way for Germany to contribute to the vision of Europe as a ‘Third Force’.

That  way  was  rearmament.  In  December  1949,  a  few  months  after  he  was  elected 
chancellor,  Adenauer  publicly  called  for  a  European  Army  and  a  possible  German 
contribution  to  it  through,  tellingly,  interviews  in  American  newspapers.331  Soon 
rearmament  became  the  central  political  issue  of  his  first  term  in  office  (Hanrieder, 
1989:  38;  Baring,  1969:  70f.). Given that the idea of rearmament appeared  incompatible 
with  the  anti-militarism/pacifism  principle  of the  ‘new  Germany’  narrative,  this  was  a 
significant  adaptation  and  highly  contested.  Domestically  it  triggered  “one  of  the 
sharpest  controversies  about  a  political  issue  ever carried  out  in  the  Federal  Republic” 
(Volkmann,  1990:  237) and was met with opposition from France and viewed with some 
suspicion in the UK.

As  concerns  over  a  ‘remilitarization’  of  Germany  were  understood  and  shared  by 
Adenauer,  it is not uncommon for scholars to apply the  ‘great power bias’  and argue that 
German rearmament was result of pressure from Washington  in the wake of the Korean 
War.  Specifically,  the  argument  is  that  this  was  a  price  the  Pentagon  requested  for 
agreeing to station additional troops in Western Europe (Gaddis, 2005 (1982):  112). This 
argument  stands  on  weak  ground,  however.  As  Hans  Peter  Schwarz  points  out,

330 The  call  for Europeans to engage in  ‘self help and mutual  aid’  was  stressed  in the influential 
Senate  Resolution  from  June  1948  sponsored by  Arthur Vandenberg, the  powerful  chairman  of 
the  Foreign  Relations  Committee,  who  kept  warning  that  a  lack  of  progress  in  European 
integration would lead Congress to reduce the financial flow (Kaplan  1984: 70-77; Winand  1994: 
20; Maier,  1990:  139).
331  The  interviews were given to the New York Times and the Cleveland Plain Dealer.  Adenauer 
made frequent use of US newspapers to disseminate his ideas.

213

Adenauer  was  thinking  about  the  possibility  of rebuilding  some  sort  of German  army 
before  being  ‘encouraged’  by  the  US.  While  for  Schwarz  Adenauer’s  interest  in 
rearmament is “one of the puzzles of his personality which can never be fully explained” 
(Schwarz  1986:  734),  Wolfram  Hanrieder  reminds  that  Adenauer  viewed, rearmament 
primarily  in  political  terms  and  that  it  became  “the  anchor  of Adenauer’s  diplomacy” 
(Hanrieder  1989:  38).  Building upon this  argument,  I  take  up the  two  reasons  given  by 
Adenauer  for  rearmament,  namely  (i)  the  acquisition  of  sovereignty  and  (ii)  the 
protection  from  a  communist  threat  and  suggest  that  both  were  used  in  support  of 
recreating Germany’s place in  ‘the West’ through NATO.

Adenauer repeatedly noted that the possession of a military was a fundamental aspect of 
‘sovereignty’;  however,  sovereignty  is  a  vague  and  contested  term.  For  Adenauer, 
‘sovereignty’  did  not  mean  ‘autonomy’  but  having  ‘equal  rights’  [Gleichberechtigung]. 
He  frequently  used  it  synonymously  with  ‘equality’  and  reminded  his  Cabinet  that 
rearmament  would  speed  up  the  path  towards  recognition  as  an  ‘equal  partner’ 
(Volkmann  1990:  240). Adenauer rejected the  idea of a national army, wanting German 
soldiers  integrated  into  a  supranational  ‘European  Army’  instead.  Neither  he  nor 
Schumacher, who was an even stronger advocate of ‘sovereignty’, wanted a reduction of 
military presence  of allied  forces  on  German territory,  quite the  opposite.332  And  while 
Adenauer was  determined to end the  Occupation  Statute put  in  place  after the  founding 
of the FRG  in  1949 (see below), this was because it kept open the possibility of ‘another 
Potsdam’; Adenauer worked hard on tying the vision of a unified Germany to the course 
of  Westintegration  and  European  unity.333  As  Hanrieder  observes,  the  sovereignty  for 
which  Adenauer  aimed  was  “of  a  rather  special  kind:  once  obtained,  it  would  be 
immediately  ‘dissipitated’  within  treaties  that  bound  Germany  to  the  West.  (...). 
Integration  and  equality  rather  than  the  quest  for  sovereign  independence  became  the 
central precepts” (Hanrieder  1989:  233).

In  short,  the  sovereignty  Adenauer  wanted  did  not  refer  to  autonomy  but  to  having  a 
voice  in  the  development  of Germany-in-(Westem)Europe.  The  German  military  was 
the  asset  Adenauer  could  offer  to  the  US  as  a  contribution  to  the  Western  project.  It 
allowed  him  to  link the  possibility  of German  participation  in  a  ‘European  army’  with

332 In  his security memorandum to the High  Commissioners from August  1950,  Adenauer called 
for a reinforcement of occupying troops (Baring  1969:  86),  as did  Schumacher in his Bundestag 
speech from November 1950 (Schumacher 1950).
333  Adenauer  tried  to  insert  an  article  (Bindungsklausel)  into  the  ‘Bonn  Conventions’  which 
would tie  future  German  governments  and the  Western  Allies  to  the  commitment that  a  united 
Germany would remain embedded in the Western project. The Article (7.2) was ultimately toned 
down on the insistence of the Allies, see Grewe (1952/1960:  58).

214

the  demand  that  Germany  had  to  be  considered  an  ‘equal  partner’  in  a  supranational 
structure, ideally NATO. By arguing that it would be impossible to ask Germans to fight 
for an order  in which they were discriminated against, Adenauer tied  rearmament to the 
revision of the Occupation  Statute and to the establishment of ‘Germany’ as a formative 
actor in the Western space through NATO. In this strategy, the  ‘communist threat’ was a 
means to an end.

Negative Visions of Germany-in-Europe
Adenauer justified  rearmament  by  through  the  use  of  a  dystopia  (see  chapter  five), 
namely the  negative vision that  Germany-in-Europe  could  become  a communist  space. 
This  allowed  him  to  entrench  the  determination  for  the  project,  that  is,  to  mobilize 
domestic support for rearmament and thus manifest the path  of Westintegration  against 
domestic critics  and to  strengthen the bonds with the American  narrative.  Adopting the 
terminology offered  by his advisor Wilhelm Grewe, Adenauer formulated two scenarios 
of the communist threat, the  ‘Korea model’  and the  ‘Prague model’, scenarios of Soviet 
military  invasion  and  political  subversion,  respectively  (Grewe  1960:  13).  Both  models 
lend the  authentic texture  for Adenauer’s narrative of undesirable  futures and  resonated 
with the US.

Dystopia I:  The  ‘Korea’ Model
The  Korea  model  contained  the  fear  of  Soviet  invasion  through  military  attack  in  the 
style of North  Korea’s  invasion of the  South  in  May  1950  with  presumed  support from 
China. The outbreak of the Korean War, which took American forces stationed there by 
surprise  and  almost  drove  them  off the  peninsula,  triggered  an  atmosphere  of panic  in 
Bonn.  The  press  service  of the  CDU  described  the  events  in  Korea  as  an  ‘educational 
film’  for  future  conflicts  in  Europe  (Koch,  1985:  260)  and  Adenauer  firmly  expressed 
his conviction that  Stalin was  planning “the  same procedure for Western  Europe  as  had 
been used in Korea” (in Kaplan  1994: 42).

The task  here  is  not to  assess the  ‘accuracy’  of Adenauer’s  vision,  which  had  been  laid 
out  long  before  the  Korean  War  in  scenarios  prepared  by  his  military  advisors,  the 
former  Wehrmacht  Generals  von  Speidel  and  von  Schwerin  (Schwarz  1986:  740).  It 
suffices to say that there were no signs of Soviet aggression against Western Europe and 
that from a balance of power perspective the Soviet Union was not a threat to a Germany 
occupied  by the  US  and  its  allies.  While  measuring the  distribution  of ‘hard  power’  in 
Europe  in  the  first  post-war years  is  notoriously  difficult,  on  the  basis  of conventional 
indicators  the  US  clearly  outweighed  the  Soviet  Union.  During  the  war  it  had  only

215

suffered  a  fraction  of the  over  20  Million  Russians  lives  that  were  lost,334  and  while 
Stalin  had  to  deal  with  heavily  damaged  cities,  industry  and  infrastructure,  the  US 
economy  had  been  boosted  by  the  war.335  Most  importantly,  the  US  military  was  not 
only  technologically  more  advanced  but  also  holding  the  monopoly  over  nuclear 
weapons.336  Ikenberry’s note that the  pre-eminent position  of the  US  was  recognized  at 
the time  is true  for the German  government, with  Adenauer in  October  1950  describing 
the  US  in  the  Bundestag  as  the  most  powerful  actor  since  the  Roman  Empire  (in 
Schroder  1988:  123).  If,  as  Kissinger  (1994:  443)  writes  “the  much-advertised  Soviet 
invasion of Western  Europe was a fantasy”, the  point made here  is that Adenauer made 
effective  use  of this  scenario  to  generate  momentum  for  German  rearmament.  It  was 
effective  because  it  struck  a  familiar  chord  in  the  German  and  the  American  narrative 
and thus was accepted as a possibility.

The  Korea  model  drew  on  several  aspects  of the  German  biography.337  There  was  the 
racist  element,  with  Adenauer  describing  Russia  as  an  ‘Asian’  space,  tapping  into  the 
familiar  theme  of Europe  facing  a  barbaric  civilisation  in  the  East  (Neumann,  1999). 
Although as  Baring (1969:  53) reminds us Adenauer used the term  ‘Asia’  rather loosely 
when  looking  Eastward,  his  view  of the  Soviet  Union  being  fundamentally  different, 
backwards  and  aggressive  echoed  the  anti-slavic  sentiment  fostered  by  the  Nazis 
(Niedhart  and  Altmann,  1988:  102).  The  racist  element  was  embedded  in  the  larger 
enemy-image  of  the  ‘red  scare’  built  up  under  Hitler  and  amplified  by  a  fear  of  a 
revenge-driven  Red  Army,  fed  by  reports  of  rape  and  oppression  told  by  German 
refugees  from  the  East.338  Most  obviously  Adenauer  benefited  from  the  Nazi’s  anti­
communist  propaganda  and  adapted  it  to  remind  of  communism’s  disregard  for 
traditional  Christian  values,  warning  that  “a  victory  of  communist  atheism”  would 
destroy  “everything  Christianity  has  given  to  humanity  over  the  2000  years  of  its 
existence” (in  Weidenfeld,  1976:  86).  Finally,  and  most  importantly, to make the  Third

334 The figure is from Gaddis (1996:  13). Judt (2005:  18) puts the total Soviet losses at around 24 
million lives. Depending on sources, the US lost up to 400,000 lives.
335  Between  1938  and  1953  the  US  share  of the world  manufacturing  output rose  from  31.4  to 
44.7 percent, compared to Russia’s 9.0 and  10.7, see Ikenberry (2001:  168); Leffler (1984: 380).
336  In  1945  Washington’s  share  of military  expenditures  among the  six  great powers  stood  at  a 
staggering  74.5  per  cent  against  Moscow’s  7.1  (Ikenberry,  2001:  168).  For  an  argument  of 
American  ‘weakness’  in the  immediate post-war period  due to demobilization, see  Coker (1989; 
36ff.).  This  argument  is  not  very  convincing,  however,  because  it  downplays  the  nuclear 
advantage  and  does  not  provide  a  comparative  perspective,  without  which  ‘power’  cannot  be 
measured.
337 On Adenauer’s enemy  image of the  Soviet Union, see also Niedhart and Altmann (1988).  It is 
not  unreasonable  to  assume  that Adenauer never expected  a  Soviet  attack.  Certainly the  Korea 
model had a brief life-span as the primary threat in Adenauer’s rhetoric, as less than a year after 
the outbreak of fighting he shifted his emphasis to the ‘Prague model’ (Schwarz  1986:  848).

Reich’s anti-Russian/Slavic/communist narrative fit with the notion of a ‘new Germany’, 
Adenauer  effectively  merged  it  with  the  negative  experience  of the  Third  Reich  itself 
and  painted the  Soviet Union  in the  colours  of Nazi  Germany by  equating communism 
with  totalitarianism.  This was  made  ‘official’  in the commentary to  the  Basic  Law  and 
with  Adenauer  attributing  an  inherent  aggressiveness  to  Stalin  by  comparing him  with 
Hitler (Schwarz  1986:  523, 553). Thus, Adenauer tapped into a rich repertoire of ‘usable 
pasts’  and although not all were convinced of an immediate  Soviet attack -  Schumacher, 
despite  being  fervently  anti-communist,  accused  Adenauer  of abusing  the  ‘fear  from 
East’  for political  purposes (Schumacher  1950) -  the  familiarity  was  sufficiently  strong 
that a majority of Germans accepted the scenario (Volkmann).

The Korea model also resonated  in the US. To be sure,  it was taken with a grain of salt. 
While the Pentagon also had produced scenarios of a Soviet invasion, an actual attack on 
Western  Europe  was  considered  unlikely  (Leffler  1984:  359ff.).339  The  consensus  in 
Washington  was  that  Adenauer  painted  an  overly  stark  image  of the  Soviet  military 
threat and that his Korea-analogy was exaggerated. Pointing to their nuclear arsenal and 
superior  naval  power,  US  officials  informed  the  German  chancellor  that  they  believed 
the likelihood of a Soviet invasion to be slim (Volkmann, 23 8f.;  Sommer  1988).

That  said,  Adenauer’s  framing  of  a  Soviet  invasion  as  an  attack  not  merely  on 
‘Germany’ but on  ‘Western civilisation’  (Volkmann  1990:  294f) fell on fertile ground.  It 
resonated  with  the  US  view  of the  communist order as  undesirable  and  the widespread 
belief that  ‘the  world’  was  facing  a  ‘red  tide’,  revived  with  Kennan’s  analysis  of the 
‘character’  of  communist  Russia  and  accentuated  with  NSC  68  (Gaddis  2005).  The 
image  of  falling  dominos  fitted  well  into  the  scenario  laid  out  in  NSC  68  and  was 
“frequently  raised”  by  US  policymakers  in  the  wake  the  Korean  War,  convincing 
Truman  that  “a  worldwide  Communist  conspiracy  had  operated  in  Korea  and  would 
manifest itself elsewhere” (Kaplan  1984:  145ff.;  Jervis  1980).  Aware that Europe was a 
special  ‘elsewhere’  for  the  US,  Adenauer’s  reaction  thus  merged  the  two  places  by 
sending  a  strong  statement  of solidarity  with  the  American  experience  in  Korea.  The 
Korea model confirmed that the worlds of Germany and the US significantly overlapped 
and  that  Adenauer  understood  US  engagement  in  Korea  as  part  of  the  project  to 
strengthen  the  Western  world  -   “a  test  of the  West’s  steadfastness”  (Kaplan  1984:  8; 
Milliken  1999).  Indeed  it  is telling that Kaplan,  who otherwise  pays very  little attention

339 According to Jervis the assessment was “mixed,  if not incoherent” (Jervis  1980:  579).

to German voices, notes that Adenauer “spoke for the allies” when he claimed that Stalin 
was  ‘testing’ the West in Korea (Kaplan  1994: 42).

The Korea experience strengthened US commitment to NATO as the primary institution 
through  which  Western  order was to  be created  (‘defended’).  As  Kaplan  puts  it,  Korea 
placed  the  ‘O ’  into  NATO:  within  six  months  of  the  invasion  the  Alliance  was 
restructured into an organisation with a strong headquarter, command structures, finance 
committees,  etc.  And  for the  Pentagon  Germany emerged  on  the  strategic  map because 
of the  military  rationale:  if Western  Europe  needed  more  troops,  who  would  be  better 
than  the  Germans  in  fighting  the  Russians?  For  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff “a  German 
component  to  NATO  was  no  longer  a  matter  of  speculation”  but  was  considered 
“mandatory”  (Kaplan  1994:  44).  The  White  House  saw  things  slightly  differently. 
Viewing NATO  primarily as  a vehicle for ordering Europe,  it was concerned  about the

threat  to  Germany-in-Europe.  The  overarching  dystopia 

Dystopia II:  The  ‘Prague’ Model
The  vision  that  Germans  could  adopt  the  ‘wrong’  value  horizon  was  captured  in  the 
‘Prague  model’.  Referring  to  the  communist  coup  in  Prague  in  February  1948,  this 
scenario  envisioned  the  communist  takeover  of  ‘Germany’  through  domestic  political 
subversion  supported  from  Moscow (a  ‘fifth  column’).  The  viability  of this  image was 
fed  not only  by the  Soviet determination to  install  Moscow-friendly  regimes  in  Eastern 
Europe  and  its  attempt  to  get  a  hold  of Berlin  but  rested  on  Adenauer’s  ‘distrust’  of 
Germans  doing  the  right  thing,  namely  that  a  disoriented  society  would  fall  for  the 
communist  promise  (Baring  1969:  57f;  Foschepoth  1994).  It  did  not  matter  that  the 
German communist party in the FRG was relatively weak and that the  Social  Democrats 
had  a  strong  leader  in  Schumacher  unwilling  to  cooperate  with  the  communists; 
Adenauer 
the  path  of 
Westintegration  and  envisioned  German  unity  as  a  demilitarized  and  neutral  state.  By 
framing  the  rearmament  decision  as  one  between  “Asian  Pagandom”  and  “European 
Christendom”, he implied that those supporting a neutral Germany would be responsible 
for the downfall of Western civilization.340

340  At  a  CDU  party  convention 
in  October  1951  Adenauer  warned:  “Neutrality  and 
demilitarization of Germany means that we will become a satellite state in a short period of time. 
This means,  furthermore, that we will  see the triumph of communism  in  France and Italy,  which 
means that the Christian Occident will be finished,  and that the  United States will lose interest in 
Europe.  Therefore,  my  friends:  Those  of  you  who  want  neutrality  and  demilitarization  of

218

At  the  same  time,  the  government  argued  that  rearmament  was  consistent  with  the 
trajectory of a new Germany unfolding  into  a peaceful  Europe.  Heinrich von  Brentano, 
Adenauer’s party colleague,  argued that the term  ‘rearmament’  was  misleading because 
it  “suggests  that  we  intend  to  restore,  or  at  least  copy,  the  past”.  Instead,  he  sought to 
reassure  domestic  critics,  the  intention  was  “to  create  something  new”,  assuring  that 
“We  do  not  want  re-militarization;  we  do  not  want  a  national  German  army  as  an 
instrument  of power-politics.  What  we  want  is  to  make  a  contribution  to  a  European 
army as  part  of the  integration  of Europe”  (von  Brentano  1950:  45).  Rearmament thus 
would not mean a fall-back into a ‘militarization’  but was a necessary contribution to the 
Western project of ‘peace through freedom and unity’.341  Reminding that US support for 
this  project was  vital,  rearmament was to  be  an  act of reciprocity.  Adenauer repeatedly 
noted  that  Washington  expected  Germany  to  contribute  to  the  ‘protection’  of  the 
Western  space  and  that  reluctance  to  do  so  would  risk  that  the  US  loses  interest  in 
‘Europe’  and, consequently, would lead to the demise of the Occident.342

The  ‘Prague’  scenario  resonated  strongly  in  the  US,  where  the  possibility  of European 
nations  falling  for  communism  had  become  a  familiar  vision.  As  Acheson  noted,  the 
scenario  was  that  the  communist  virus  would  infect  others  “like  apples  in  a  barrel 
infected  by  a  rotten  one”  (in  Kaplan  1984:  33).  The  objective  of preventing  political 
‘subversion’  of  European  states  by  communist  parties  had  of  course  been  central  to 
getting the  ‘Marshall Plan’  through Congress and by  1950 the  image of a  ‘fifth column’ 
had even befallen American domestic life, captured in  ‘McCarthyism’. US receptiveness 
for this  dystopia was  exploited  by  Adenauer to  gain  voice  and  improve his  standing  in 
the  West.  Pointing  to  his  thin  mandate  -   Adenauer  in  1949  had  won  election  in  the 
Bundestag  by  only  one  vote  -   and  the  strong  domestic  opposition  to  his  rearmament 
plans,  in  1950  he  repeatedly  warned  Washington  that  the  forces  favouring  German 
neutrality were  gaining  strength  and  that  support for his  course  of Westintegration  was 
waning.  Leaving  aside  whether  Adenauer  was  really  as  weak  domestically  as  he 
presented  it to his American colleagues, he was most effective  in transmitting the  image

emphasis added).
341  An  example  of  how  German  rearmament  was  portrayed  as  ‘European’  rearmament  and 
justified  with  a combination  of the  ‘Korea model’  and the  ‘Prague model’  is  found  in  Die  Welt 
from February  1951.
342 On  Adenauer’s continuous worry about US  isolationism,  see Poppinga (1975:  80ff).  In  1952 
Adenauer called on  his  Cabinet that it was  important to demonstrate willingness  for progress  in 
the  project  of European  unity  to  support  Eisenhower  in  the  upcoming  US  elections.  Adenauer 
feared  that  the  challenger,  Tafts,  would  prioritize  ‘Asia’  over  ‘Europe’  (Maier,  1990:  115; 
Jackson 2006: 224).

of a  German  society  still  unsure  whether  the  most  desirable  future  was  found  ‘in’  the 
West.

The  warning  that  the  US  might  ‘lose’  Germany  tapped  into  the  ‘Rapallo  complex’. 
Referring  to  the  1922  treaty  between  the  Germany  and  communist  Russia,  ‘Rapallo’ 
stood  for  the  scenario  of  Germany  turning  towards  Russia  as  a  reaction  to  feeling 
humiliated/frustrated  with  the  West.  It was  an  analogy  regularly  used  by  US  diplomats 
to  refer to the  possibility  of a neutral  Germany bonding with  Moscow (Schroder  1988: 
140).  In March  1950, three months before the outbreak of the Korean War, a report from 
the  State  Department invoked  the  possibility  of another  ‘Rapallo’.  Acheson  went  on  to 
note  that a  new  initiative  was  needed  to  ensure  anchoring  Germany  in  the  West.  Later 
that  year,  after  a  meeting  with  Adenauer  and  Schumacher,  McCloy  reported  back  to 
Washington  that  the  course  of  Westintegration  was  loosing  attraction  in  the  FRG  and 
suggested “to take a drastic step toward political unity such as the establishing of articles 
of  confederation  for  Europe”  and  to  consider  bringing  Germany  into  NATO  so  that 
“Germans will  begin to see promise in  a future by the side of Western democracies” (in 
Lundestad  1998:  3 5f.).

In  sum,  the  analogies  of ‘Korea’  and  ‘Prague’  were  used  successfully  by  Adenauer  to 
manifest  a  vision  of what  Germany/Europe  could  become  if not  for  Westintegration. 
Those  negative visions strengthened US  commitment to  invest  into Germany-in-Europe 
and  allowed  Adenauer  to  reciprocate  by  offering  German  rearmament  as  a  valuable 
contribution 
through  which  NATO 
membership could be claimed.

The Rocky Path from EDC to NATO
Even  with  the  Bonn-Washington  consensus  on  rearmament the  path  to  German NATO 
membership  was  a  difficult  one.  The  six  years  which  lay  between  Adenauer’s  first 
mentioning  this  aim  in  March  1949  and  its  formal  admission  in  May  1955  saw  an 
intense period of negotiations between the Western Allies and  Germany, which  is worth 
sketching  out  because  it  exemplifies  the  bond  between  Bonn  and  Washington.  The 
negotiations took the following steps: the revision of Occupation  Statute  in March  1951, 
followed by negotiations over its termination leading to ‘Bonn Conventions’  and parallel 
negotiations  over  the  European  Defense  Community  (EDC)  culminating  in  the  EDC 
Treaty.  The  two  were  signed  in  May  1952,  with  the  clause  that  the  former would  not 
enter  into  force  until  the  latter  was  ratified  as  well  by  all  parties.  When  the  French 
assembly failed to do so in  1954,  bringing about the failure of EDC, the  ‘Paris Treaties’

220

in October  1954 finally allowed Germany to enter NATO and terminated the Occupation 
Statute, coming into force in May  1955.343

The  main  hurdle  was  French  and  British  reservations  about  Adenauer’s  strategy  to 
increase Germany’s position in the West, echoed  in their less than enthusiastic reception 
of his  ‘communist threat’  scenarios.  In  Paris  and  London  the  question  which  direction 
Germany should not take had an answer already:  it was the pre-45  Germany they knew. 
As noted earlier, the primary concern of the French was not the development of a  ‘new’ 
Germany  but  oppressing  the  ‘old’  and  familiar  one.  Yet  also  the  British  view  that 
Germans  could  be  gradually  brought  back  into  the  circle  of civilized  nations  did  not 
quite  resonate  with  the  Germ an-American  stance  that  ‘Germany’  urgently  had  to  be 
saved from becoming communist. The New York conference of Allied foreign ministers 
in  September  1950  exposed  the  differences  among  the  Western  Allies  on  the  issue  of 
German rearmament and Adenauer’s demand for ‘equality’  (Baring,  1969:  95).  Whereas 
the  British  were  hesitant  to  have  the  FRG  rearmed  and  put  forward  a  proposal  for 
establishing a West German police force,  Paris rejected the  idea of German membership 
in NATO and expressed  its sincere discomfort about rearmament plans.344

When  the  US  pressured  France  to  provide  an  alternative  to  German  membership  in 
NATO,  Monnet came up with a design for a European Army  in what came to be known 
as  the  ‘Pleven  Plan’  (named  after  the  Prime  Minister  Renee  Pleven).  This  plan  was 
rejected,  in turn,  not only  by Adenauer but  also  by the  US  and  Britain.  It  was  strongly 
criticized  not  only  by  military  experts  for  being  unsound  but  was  also  politically 
unacceptable  as  it  was  highly  discriminatory  towards  Germany  and  appeared  to  be 
designed  mainly  to  drag  out  the  issue  of German  rearmament  -   precisely  the  reasons 
why  the  French  National  Assembly  had  accepted  it  (Maier  1990:  231;  Kaplan  1984: 
24).345  Sensitive  to  French  resistance,  the  US  and  Germany  built  on  the  idea  of  a 
European army under NATO’s oversight. Also for domestic reasons, Adenauer publicly 
rejected  the  idea of setting  up  a  ‘national’  army.  And  while  the  Pentagon  continued  to 
emphasize  NATO  membership  on  pragmatic  operational  grounds  (Maier  1990:  138), 
State  Department  and  White  House  endorsed  a  ‘European  solution’  because  it  fit  with

343 As McAllister (2002:  24,  Fn 54) points out, there  is surprisingly little research on  EDC  in the 
English-speaking literature.  He provides a good discussion  on this and German rearmament from 
the US perspective (McAllister 2002, Ch. 5).
344  The  French  National  Assembly  in  October  1950  explicitly  rejected  entrance  of a  state  into 
NATO  which  might  have  territorial  claims,  a  diplomatic  shortcut  for  Germany  (Maier  1990; 
Ruane2000:  17).
345  Adenauer, true  to  his  game,  blamed the  French  objection  to  German  NATO  membership to 
French communists undermining Schumann (Maier  1990: 93, 211).

integration.  While  the  Pentagon  never  warmed  up  to  the  EDC 

After  a  number  of  revisions  which  reduced  German  discriminatory  measures  in  the 
French proposal and established a link to NATO, in  September  1951  the Allies agreed to 
integrate  a  German  defense  contribution  in  a  European  Defense  Community  (EDC).347 
The EDC proposal maintained Monnet’s idea to have the European Army established as 
an  element  of  political  integration  running  parallel  to  and  eventually  merging  with 
economic 
idea, 
Truman/Acheson  and  Eisenhower/Dulles  came  to  see  it  as  a  central  step  towards 
securing the  FRGs commitment to West and establishment of a United  States of Europe 
within  NATO’s  sight.  In  other  words,  EDC  was  seen  as  the  best  option  for  creating  a 
third force in the West. Assured that the US was underwriting the EDC proposal and that 
it  was  embedded  in  a  larger Western  project  and  linked  to NATO,  Adenauer agreed.348 
The  chancellor  even  told  the  Bundestag  in  early  February  1952  that joining  the  EDC 
would  eventually  lead  to  NATO  membership  (Baring  1969:  119).  To  accommodate 
French  reservations,  he  publicly  withdrew  demands  for  direct  NATO  membership, 
though  adding  that  EDC  membership  should  not  rule  out  the  possibility  of  NATO 
membership in the future.  In turn, the French National  Assembly agreed to the  idea of a 
European  army  in  which  Germany  could  participate  without  discriminatory  conditions 
(Maier  1990:  88-90).

The  signing  of EDC  and  Bonn  Conventions -  Adenauer’s  wish  of calling  it  ‘Germany 
Treaty’  was blocked by the French -  in May  1952 were celebrated as a success in Bonn 
and  Washington.  Article 4 of the  ‘Bonn  Conventions’  crucially stated that Allied  forces 
stationed  on  German territory would  have the  stated  purpose  “to  defend the  free world, 
to  which  the  Federal  Republic  and  Berlin  belongs”  (also  Grewe  1960:  51).  This 
transformation from  ‘occupying’  to  ‘defending’  forces was crucial  because would mean 
de facto  Germany’s  transformation  as  a  place  in  the  West.349  The  hurdle,  though,  was 
ratification.  Britain  remained  highly  sceptical  about the  federal  design  and  did  not  like

346 Disagreements between the military and the political  viewpoints  led to mixed signals coming 
out of Washington which only ceded somewhat when  Eisenhower was persuaded of the political 
purpose of a European Army,  a change of mind which as analysts suggests came after a meeting 
with Monnet in May  1951  (Winand  1993; Dwan 2000).
347  On  how  military  integration  was  to  be  organised  in  EDC,  see  Ruane  (2000:  16).  The  link 
between NATO and EDC was outlined in two protocols, see Maier (1990:  104f,  122f.).
348  On  the  importance  of the  link  with  the  US  for  Adenauer  during  the  EDC  negotiations,  see

the  idea of tying  Western  defense  to  European  integration.  Only  after  Washington  had 
accepted  London’s  unwillingness  to  play  a  significant  role  in  the  project,  the  British 
supported the  EDC to keep the US  happy and  committed to  Europe (Ruane 2000:  27ff; 
Maier  1990:  91).  The  problem  was  France,  where  military  defeats  in  Indochina  and 
British reluctance to get involved reduced confidence in EDC.  When  it became clear that 
ratification  was  in  danger,  the  US  exercised  pressure  on  Paris  through  both  sticks  and 
carrots, though without much success (Ruane 2000: 46f.; Maier  1990:  138). Adenauer in 
1953  wrote  to  a  party  colleague  “the  Americans  are  currently  our  only  friends”  (in 
Schwarz,  1991: 47).

When  the  French  parliament  in  August  1954  rejected  the  EDC,  the  German-American 
project  appeared  to  have  hit  a  wall.  Eisenhower  was  frustrated  and  Adenauer  was 
devastated, fearing that the US now would abandon the European project and with  it the 
path  carved  out  for  the  new  Germany.  The  British  government  came  to  the  rescue 
(Ruane,  2000).  Privately  welcoming  the  ‘death’  of the  federal  utopia,  Churchill  and 
Eden  saw  a  chance  to  revitalise  NATO  and,  with  French  approval,  worked  out  a 
compromise which  paved the way for Germany  into NATO  via the  ‘Western  European 
Union’  (WEU)  (Grewe  1960:  63f).  Washington  and  Bonn  welcomed  the  proposal,  and 
the  treaties  where  revised  and  in  May  1955  the  FRG  acquired  NATO  membership, 
ensuring German participation  in the debate about its future in the ‘free world’.

Conclusion
Against  the  backdrop  of  a  reading  of  security  institutions  serving  the  purpose  of 
negotiating  a  common  project  among  friends,  this  chapter  provided  evidence  for  the 
argument that  German and  American  decision  makers  invested  in  NATO  because  they 
considered  it  the  most  suitable  institution  through  which  they  could  transform  their 
shared  experienced  space,  Europe,  into  a shared  envisioned  space.  The  chapter  showed 
Adenauer,  on  the  one  side,  and  Truman,  Acheson  and  Eisenhower,  on  the  other  side, 
coming to  see each  other as attractive partners -  more so than with  either France or the 
UK  -   for  redefining  their  respective  place  in  the  world,  that  is,  for  rendering  their 
‘being-in-Europe’  meaningful through the  idea of a peaceful  Europe ordered around the 
value  of  ‘freedom’  and  ‘unity’.  In  other  words,  they  shared  the  common  interest  of 
turning  ‘Europe’  into a meaningful space through the vision (utopia) of a ‘United  States 
of  Europe’  which  resonated  with  respective  national  biographies  and  manifested 
German-American friendship in a shared Western project.

223

It has also been argued that this investment provided Adenauer with a partner supportive 
of  German  rehabilitation  in  a  Christian/Occidental  space  willing  to  treat  him  as  an 
‘equal’. At the same time it provided the Truman and Eisenhower administrations with a 
friend  who  understood  their  world  and  with  whom  they  could  build  up  a  European 
‘Third  Force’  supportive of the US  narrative.  Both  sides came to agree that NATO was 
the  suitable  forum  for doing  so  and  the  discussion  suggested  that  Adenauer’s  push  for 
rearmament was a strategy aimed at establishing Germany’s status as a formally  ‘equal’ 
member in NATO. He mobilized negative visions, or dystopias, of what Germany ‘could 
become  if  not  for  Westintegration,  -   the  Korea  model  and  the  Prague  model  -   to 
strengthen  the  bond  with  the  US  narrative  and  to justify  the  adjustment  of the  pacifist 
element  of  the  FRG’s  narrative  domestically.  The  next  chapter  discusses  why,  two 
decades later, the German government deemed it necessary to invest in a new institution.

CHAPTER NINE: CSCE / GERMAN-US TENSIONS (1965-1975)

Introduction

The  previous  chapter  showed  how,  in  the  decade  following  World  War  Two,  German 
and  American  policymakers  bonded  over  the  idea  of  how  to  order  Europe  through 
NATO  in  a way  that  resonated  with  their respective national  biographies.  This  chapter 
focuses on Willy Brandt as the main figure representing the German narrative to offer an 
explanation  for  his  motivation  to  invest  in  a  new  institution  for  ordering  ‘Europe’, 
namely the Conference of Security and  Cooperation  in  Europe (CSCE)  in which the US 
was  reluctant to  participate.350  Applying the  estrangement lens  developed  earlier,  I  seek 
to  explain  this  in  terms  of a  divergence  between  German  and  American  narratives  of 
authentic  becoming,  specifically  with  an  emerging  dissonance  about  a  desirable  vision 
(utopia)  for  European  order.  To  substantiate  this  argument,  the  chapter  traces  the 
narratives  of ‘Germany’  and  ‘America’  in-the-world  as  formulated  by  Brandt/Bahr (on 
the  German  side) and Johnson  and Nixon/Kissinger (on the  US  side)  between  1965  and 
1975, with particular attention given to their visions of ‘peace  in Europe’  and how these 
informed evaluations of NATO and CSCE.

The  discussion  proceeds  as  follows:  first,  it  outlines  Brandt’s  vision  of  ‘Germany-in- 
Europe’,  how  it  differs  from  Adenauer’s  version,  and  how  it  motivates  a  policy  of 
peaceful  change.  Second,  it notes Kennedy’s  influence  in  formulating this narrative and 
also  shows  how,  at  the  same  time,  the  Berlin  Wall  experience  exposed  the  dissonance 
between  German  and  American  narratives.  Third,  it outlines  attempts to tone  down  the 
dissonance through NATO’s Harmel Report and Brandt’s silence on the US engagement 
in Vietnam.  Fourth,  it discusses the Nixon administration’s reorientation  of America-in- 
the-world  and  the  ambiguous  role  of  Europe  in  this  narrative  and  carves  out  the 
disagreements  between  Kissinger and  Brandt over visions  of European  order.  The  final 
part of the chapter links this to German-American differences concerning the evaluations 
of CSCE  and  closes  with  a  review  of Kissinger’s  failed  ‘Year  of Europe’  attempt  to 
reinvigorate the partnership.

350  There  is  very  little  literature  on  German  motives  and  corresponding  position  in  the  CSCE 
process.  See  Becker  (1992);  Spohr  Readman  (2006),  also  Peters  (1999).  A  recent  and  valuable 
publication  which  goes  in  the  direction  of the  account  presented  in  this  chapter  is  Bange  and 
Niedhart (2008).  For the US position,  see Maresca (1984).  On the CSCE process and  its  effects, 
mostly with how it contributed to the end of the Cold War,  see Bender (1996);  Schlotter (1999); 
Thomas (2001); Adler (1996).

Brandt
The (re)formulation of Germany’s national  biography in  and the  investment in CSCE  in 
the  period  under  investigation  here was  pursued  most forecefully  by  Willy  Brandt,  first 
as  Foreign  Minister  (1966-69)  and  then  as  Chancellor  (1969-72).  Brandt  was  the  first 
Social  Democrat holding a leading position  in the federal government since the founding 
of the  FRG.351  As  a young  social  democrat,  he  had  escaped Nazi  persecution  by  going 
into exile in  Scandinavia (mainly Norway) and returned to Germany after the end of the 
war to  resume  both  his  citizenship  and  his  political  activities  in  the  Social  Democratic 
Party (SPD).  With  Schumacher’s  help Brandt became a member of parliament in  1949, 
then serving as an assistant to Ernst Reuter, the mayor of West Berlin, before taking this 
post  himself  in  October  1957.  In  1961  and  1964  Brandt  was  the  (unsuccessful)  SPD 
candidate  for  Chancellor,  became  the  party’s  leader  in  1964  and  in  1966  Foreign 
Minister  in  the  Grand  Coalition,  with  Kurt-Georg  Kiesinger  (CDU)  as  Chancellor.  He 
succeeded Kiesinger as Chancellor in  1969, was confirmed in this position in a sweeping 
re-election  in  1972  before  forced  to  resign  in  1974,  handing  the  position  over  to  his 
party-colleague Helmut Schmidt.

As  will  become  clear  in  this  chapter,  the  SPD’s  understanding  of Germany-in-Europe 
differed  significantly  from  that  propagated  by  Adenauer’s  Christian  Democrats.  This 
inevitably made the Kiesinger/Brandt government’s formulation of the German narrative 
a  compromise  and  less  sharp.  Kiesinger  was  willing,  however,  to  shift  away  from 
Adenauer’s  course  and  pursue  some  significant  Ostpolitik  initiatives.352  This  created 
CDU-intemal 
loyalists  accusing  Kiesinger  of 
compromising  core  principles  of  Westintegration  by  giving  in  to  Brandt’s  course. 
Eventually  the  differences  between  Kiesinger  and  Brandt  and  their  respective  parties 
concerning the path Germany-in-Europe should take became unbridgeable and led to the 
break-up  of the  coalition  in  1969,  with  Brandt taking  over  as  chancellor  in  a  coalition 
with the Liberal Party (FDP).

tensions,  however,  with  Adenauer 

351  Bom under the name of Herbert Frahm, he took on the pseudonym  ‘Willy Brandt’  after Hitler 
came to power. For a biography, see Prittie (1974); Merseburger (2002).
352  Kiesinger  gradually  moved  away  from  the  Hallstein  doctrine  (or  ‘around  it’,  as  Kiesinger 
preferred  to  put  it)  by  taking  up  diplomatic  relations  with  Rumania  in  January  1967  and  with 
Yugoslavia in early  1968, and establishing low-level contacts with the GDR (Hacke 2003:  134f). 
These  initiatives  stripped  Westintegration  of Adenauer’s  maxim  of non-engagement  with  ‘the 
East’.  On  Kiesinger’s  Ostpolitik  and  the  relations  with  the  US,  see  Niedhart  (1999);  Hacke 
(2003).

Like  Adenauer,  Brandt  was  a  combination  of  a  visionary  and  a  practitioner  of 
realpolitik.353  As  Golo  Mann  (1971)  reminds  us  in  his  foreword  to  a  collection  of 
Brandt’s  speeches,  Brandt was  well  aware  of the  importance of moral  forces, or values, 
in  the  Weltgetriebe  and  structured  his  conception  of  Germany’s  national  biography. 
Brandt emphasised the  importance of history as a guideline.  In a book written during his 
time as foreign minister, he notes how he was guided by the “knowledge that you cannot 
escape your people’s history but carry  it as a heritage and experience” and that the task 
was to use the various forces contained in this history in a fruitful way, emphasizing the 
responsibility  to  build  on  “the  tradition  of  a  movement  for  liberty  and  its  will  to 
form/create  [Gestaltungswille]” (Brandt  1968:  2 If.).  While  less cunning than  Adenauer 
in  day-to-day  practice,  he  shared  the  old  Chancellor’s  thinking  in  long  term  processes 
and  his  evolutionary  understanding  of  politics,  the  fixing  a  greater  vision  gradually 
approached  through  ‘politics  of small  steps’  (Mann  1971:  15-20).  Supported  by  Egon 
Bahr,  a  close  aide  whose  conceptual  thinking  played  an  important  role  in  Brandt’s 
formulation  of  the  German  narrative,  the  belief  in  social  democratic  principles  and 
personal  experiences  Brandt  to  pursue  a  utopia  of Germany-in-Europe  different  from 
Adenauer’s in important aspects.

Envisioning Germany-in-(G>eater-)Eiirope
For  Brandt,  the  highest  value  for  Germany’s  future  was  ‘peace’  and, 
like  his 
predecessors, Brandt conceived of a peaceful Germany as embedded in a united Europe. 
When  in  his  two  speeches  at  Harvard  in  1962  Brandt  emphasized the  interdependence 
between  the  German question  and  the  European  order, this was  a  long-held  conviction. 
Already  in  1949  he  spoke  of a “European  solution” for the new Germany and that task 
was to think “about Germany’s place in the European order” (in Brandt  1971:  48-49).354 
Brandt  envisioned  to  have  Germany unfold  in  a  ‘European  Peace  Order’  [Europaische 
Friedensordnung\  based  on  the  familiar  principles  of freedom/democracy and  unity.355 
In  a  speech  to  Social  Democrats  in  Berlin  in  May  1949  he  referred  to the  Heidelberger 
Programme  and  its  call  for  the  creation  of  a  ‘United  States  of  Europe’  to  note  that 
commitment  to  European  unity  was  central  to  social  democratic  thinking  (in  Brandt 
1971:  52).  Almost two  decades  later,  in  a  speech  to  the  Council  of Europe  in  January 
1967  Brandt claimed that all the different paths pursued  in  Bonn were “striving towards

353 The latest biography on Brandt is subtitled ‘visionary and realist’ (Merseburger, 2002).
354  Before  Thomas  Mann  put  out  his  famous  dictum,  Brandt  noted  in  1946  that  “the  Nazis 
attempted to Germanise Europe in their own  way. Now the task is to Europeanise Germany” (in 
Brandt 1971:41).
355  See the collection of his  speeches in Brandt (1971).  In  Stockholm  in  February  1945  he noted 
that the post-war order would be marked by claiming rights of freedom and democracy (in Brandt 
1971:23).

227

the  same  goal:  European  unity”  (in  Brandt  1970:  21).  While  the  commitment  to 
democracy  was  ingrained  in  the  party’s  identity,  according  to  Kocka  (2004:  41)  the 
explicit  adoption  of  ‘freedom’  as  a  core  value  first  occurred  noted  explicitly  with  the 
1959  Godesberger  Programm,  which  also  marked 
the  SPD’s  acceptance  of 
‘Westintegration’  and,  hence,  the  role  of  the  United  States  as  a  partner  in  creating 
Germany in the Western space.

That  said,  Brandt’s  utopia  was  distinct  from  the  one  pursued  by  Adenauer  in  two 
fundamental  ways.  First,  Brandt  pursued  the  idea  of  a  Europe  built  on  a  social 
democratic  order.  His  commitment  to  social  democracy  as  an  ordering  principle, 
exemplified  by  his  party  affiliation,  for  the  European  space  was  fostered  by  his  exile 
experience  in  Scandinavian  social  democratic  countries  during  the  war,  in  particular 
Norway.  Oliver Bange even  suggests that “Brandt’s  idea of a  ‘social  democratisation  of 
Europe’  was  bom  in  Scandinavia”  (Bange,  2006:  715).  Like  Schumacher,  for  Brandt 
social democracy was the only alternative to communist totalitarianism, even noting that 
“the  United  States  of Europe  will  be  filled  with  social  democratic  thinking or they will 
not  be.”  (Brandt,  1970:  53).  Even  though  as  Chancellor  he  sought  to  downplay  the 
impression  that  he  was  pursuing  a  different  conception  of  European  order  than  his 
predecessors.356  ‘social(ist)’  values  remained  central  to  the  Europe  he  envisioned,  also 
exemplified  in  his  attempt to  bring Britain  and  Scandinavian  countries  into  the  EEC.357 
In March  1963  he noted that Europe was not limited to the six EEC members: “the signs 
of our  times  point  towards  greater  integration  (Zusammenschlusse).  Nobody  will  stop 
this development” (Brandt,  1971:  77)

Here  the  second  major  departure  from  Adenauer’s  course  emerges.  Whereas  the  latter 
planned to have Germany to unfold into a Europe anchored geographically in the South- 
West,  Brandt undertook an adjustment of Germany’s  path  into a wider European  space. 
Most  importantly,  when  he  discarded  the  project  of a  ‘small’  or  ‘Vatican  Europe’  and 
formulated  the  idea  of Germany  situated  in  a  ‘Greater  Europe’  [Gesamteuropa],358  this 
also  encompassed  ‘the  East’.  This  crucial  and  most  controversial  spatial  extension  of 
Germany-in-Europe,  which  informed  his  Ostpolitik,  was  formed  significantly  through 
Brandt’s experience of living in Berlin.

356  In  a  speech  to  the  Bundestag  in  November  1970  Brandt  noted  that the  project  of European 
unity  should  not be  hampered  by  tensions  over  ‘Christian  Democratic’  or  ‘socialist’  notions  of 
‘Europe’,  as  both  would  share  the  deeper  commitment  to  liberal,  law-based  and  social 
democracy.
357 In July  1972 he noted to Pompidou that economic growth could not remain the only indicator 
of success in European integration and proposed a ‘Social Union’  (Brandt,  1976: 345).
358 The literal translation would be ‘entire Europe’.

228

Whereas  Adenauer was  never  fond  of Berlin,  Brandt  conceived  of the  European  space 
largely from Berlin. Until the wall was built in  1961, the city had been an example of the 
permeability  of the  borders  between  Eastern  and  Western  zones.  As  discussed  below, 
witnessing  the  division  first  hand,  convinced  Brandt  of  the  human  tragedy  of  the 
division of Germany-in-Europe.  It made him  ‘see’  that the European  space was not, and 
could  not  be,  limited  to  ‘the  West’  but  needed  to  encompass  ‘the  East’  as well.  In  that 
sense,  the  Berlin  years  widened  his  horizon  of experience:  despite  his  rejection  of the 
communist  order,  Brandt  did  not  see 
‘the  East’  as  a  foreign,  backward  and 
fundamentally  ‘different’  land  as  Adenauer  had  done.  Just  as  the  GDR  was  part  of 
‘Germany’, most Warsaw Pact countries were part of ‘Europe’.  Thus,  in a speech to the 
Bundestag in November  1970 he stressed the importance of including the  ‘East’  into the 
future  of Europe,  warning  of an  internal  contradiction  when  “if we  conjure  the  future 
(only) to the West and the past (only) to the East” (Brandt,  1976:  331).359

That  said,  Brandt’s  vision  of  Greater  Europe  remained  situated  within  the  Western 
space.  While his domestic critics complained that Brandt was pursuing the “chimera of a 
Grossraum  Europer”  at  the  cost  of West  European  integration  (in  Ash,  1993:  25),  this 
was  not  the  case.  While  Brandt  did  speak  against  a  “one-sided  West  orientation”  and 
favoured a policy of ‘Ausgleich'  (Ash,  1993:  37f.),  in  line with the  SPD’s programmatic 
‘turn’  at  Bad  Godesberg  in  1959  in  which  the  party  formally  gave  up  opposition  to 
Westintegration,  Brandt saw the project of building a Greater Europe  as  occurring from 
within the Western space.  He noted that Social Democratic internationalism  in tune with 
the  Atlantic  Charter (Ibid., 26) and  did  not  see  a contradiction  between  West-European 
integration  and  the  building of a Greater Europe,  quite  the contrary (Brand,  1976:  318- 
373).  When  taking  office  as  Chancellor  in  1969,  he  took  steps  to  reinvigorate  the  EC 
process  and  repeatedly  expressed  how  Western  European  integration  was  part  of the 
vision of a greater European order.  Indeed, he wanted the EC to become an “exemplary 
order”  which  would  serve  as  building  block  for  his  Greater  European  Peace  Order 
[Gesamteuropdische  Friedensordnung]  (Brandt,  1976:  320,  331).  As  Bange  puts  it, 
Brandt saw the two  processes  as  “two equally valued  pillars  of an  overarching concept 
for  the  ‘social  democratisation’  of  a  Greater  Europe”  (Bange,  2006:  713).  Brandt’s 
vision  of Germany-in-Europe  thus  did  not  intend  to  replace  ‘Western’  with  ‘Eastern’

359 Already  in  1945  he  vowed that “the problem  of Germany  and  Europe can  only be  solved  on 
the basis of freedom and democracy.  It can  only be solved  by bringing together West and  East -  
and what lies in the middle” (Brandt  1971: 41).

229

orientation  but,  rather,  to  shift  of the  vision  of Europe  within  the  Western  project.  By 
doing so, he inevitably attempted to alter the character of the latter as visible in Brandt’s 
‘New Ostpolitik’.

Building the new European Order trough Peaceful Change
Traditionally,  discussions  of Ostpolitik  read  it  as  Deutschlandpolitik  and  focus  on  the 
bilateral  ‘Eastern’  treaties,  treating  the  CSCE  process  as  an  add-on  without  greater 
political  significance  (for  instance,  Haftendom,  1985:  159-252).  The  Germany-in- 
Europe  perspective  does  not  consider  ‘Germany’  isolated  from  the  broader  European 
space, and so in this chapter I follow the more recent interpretation of Bange (2006) and 
read  Ostpolitik  as  Europapolitik  of which  the  CSCE  process  became  an  intrinsic  part 
(Bange, 2006).

Ostpolitik was driven by Brandt’s conviction that the division of Germany-in-Europe did 
not  constitute  a  state  of  peace  and  that  building  Germany-in-Europe  required  a 
transformation  of the  status  quo  (the  order of Yalta).  Most  importantly,  it rested  on  his 
conviction  that  such  a  transformation  was  possible.  In  his  Harvard  speech  in  October 
1962  Brandt noted that recognition of ‘coexistence’  of East and  West was giving rise to 
a  ‘chance’,  with  which  he  meant  a  perspective  of change  through  small  steps.  Brandt 
was  convinced  of the  artificiality  and  permeability  of the  borders  in  Europe  and  noted 
that  establishing  points  of  contact  between  East  and  West  would  at  core  be  about 
pursuing a “politics of transformation” (Brandt  1971:  89).  A revitalised  Europe “a self- 
confident,  dynamic  West”  would  provide  an  opportunity  for  “a  peaceful  offensive  of 
freedom” which  would  contribute to the deconstruction  of walls  (in  Brandt  1971:  111). 
These  thoughts  were  reiterated  in  1963  in  Tutzing,  where  Brandt  called  for  a  “new 
dynamic”  in  orienting Germany and  a policy of peaceful  change which  would  break up 
the  static division  of Europe.  This  approach  was  captured  famously by  Egon  Bahr who 
in his Tutzing speech coined the catchy slogan ‘change through rapprochement’  [Wandel 
durch Anndherung].

It is important to note the intrinsic link Brandt made between ‘peace’  and  ‘change’  when 
emphasising  peaceful  change.  The  conviction  that  “peace...is  nothing  static  but  a 
dynamic  process”  (in  Brandt  1971:  110)  reveals  that  for  Brandt  the  process  of 
transforming  the  space  into  a  Greater  and  Social  Democratic  Europe  was  not  simply 
means to  an  end.  In  an  evolutionary national  biography,  ‘endpoints’  are  never reached. 
Brandt’s vision established a new horizon in which the unfolding of Germany-in-Europe 
was to occur and there was no difference between this envisioned space and how to  ‘get

230

there’.  By investing in the transformative potential of this vision, the process of peaceful 
change was as an end  in itself. Brandt was convinced that change was possible.  For him, 
the  building  of the  Berlin  wall  and  the  violent  oppression  of the  reform  movement  in 
Czechoslovakia in  1968  were  signs of weakness of the communist order.  And  so  rather 
than risking an  infection of the Western space with the communist ‘virus’, as envisioned 
in  Adenauer’s  ‘Prague’  scenario  (see  previous  chapter),  Brandt  was  convinced  that 
increased points of contact would have the opposite effect.360

A major target of this change was the conception o f ‘Germany-in-Europe’  in the national 
biographies  of  Eastern  Europe.  This  was  one  of the  key  points  made  by  Egon  Bahr. 
Upon becoming head of policy planning in the Foreign Office in  1967, Bahr organised a 
brainstorming  session  about  how  unification  could  be  achieved.  The  result  was  the 
recognition that neighbours needed to feel so secure from  ‘Germany’ that they would not 
be  afraid  of  its  unification,  which  lead  to  the  subsequent  question  of  how  ‘Europe’ 
would have to be organised to provide security not only for and but also from  Germany 
(Bahr  1996:  226).  In  other  words,  building  a  Germany  in  a  Greater  Europe  meant 
creating a narrative  of the  FRG  whose  ‘past’  and  ‘future’  positively resonated  not only 
with  ‘the  West’  but also with  ‘the East’.  This meant Brandt needed to adjust the  FRG’s 
biography,  that  is,  he  had  to  devise  a  narrative  which  broke  with  the  continuities 
Adenauer had maintained to the Third Reich, most notably the scathing anti-communism 
and the ‘forgetting’  of Nazi crimes.

Brandt  did  not  make  use  of the  dystopia  of  a  communist  Germany.  In  his  eyes,  the 
Western branding of communism as a threat had manifested the division of Germany-in- 
Europe.  While  Brandt/the  Social  Democrats  rejected  the  communism  as  a  desirable 
order,361  formally expressed  in  the  1959  Godesberger Program, they  did  not consider  it 
an  alien 
the  SPD’s  (and  Brandt’s) 
disagreement  with  communism  was  anchored  on  a  different  level,  namely  in  the 
translation  of socialist  principles  into  political  practice.  This  meant there  was  a  shared

ideology,  as  Adenauer  had  done. 

Instead, 

360 Brandt noted to NATO colleagues in  April  1969 that the Prague  Spring was evidence  for the 
weakening of the dream  of a communist Europe and, thus,  for the possibility for changing views 
of the  people  in  the  Warsaw  Pact  towards  something  close  to  social  democracy  (Brandt  1976: 
282-288).  Already  in  1958  he  claimed  “we  have  much  more  chance  of poisoning  them,  so  to 
speak” (in Hofmann 2006: 436)
3  1  In  a  speech  to  his  SPD  colleagues  in  January  1949,  at the  height of the  Berlin  blockade,  he 
noted that “today one cannot be  a democrat without being anti-communist.  But anti-communism 
is not the only criteria of the democrat” (Brandt  1971: 44).

231

baseline  which  allowed  offering  nations  in  ‘Eastern  Europe’  a  democratic  alternative 
from within the socialist narrative.362

A  major  hurdle  was  to  address  the  ‘image  problem’  the  FRG  had  in  the  East.  Just  as 
Adenauer had  projected  memories  of the  Third  Reich  into  the  East through  the  ‘Korea 
model’,  the  same  was  done  in  reverse  by  Moscow  and  the  GDR  leadership,  in  whose 
narrative  the  FRG  was  the  continuation  of German  fascist  order  in  the  colours  of a 
capitalist,  imperialist,  and  aggressive state  aimed  at dominating  ‘Europe’.  This  strategy 
of using each other for locating and disposing of the  ‘bad’  memories of the Third Reich 
worked well  as  long  as there  were  two  ‘Germany’s’.  Flowever,  Brandt was  well  aware 
that  a  unified  Germany  would  not  have  this  luxury.  Any  attempt  by  the  FRG  to  claim 
sole  representation  of  the  German  national  biography  in  Greater  Europe  could  only 
succeed  by taking on  responsibility  for what had  happened  in  Germany’s name,  that  is, 
by taking ownership of and  dealing with Third  Reich memories. Already  in  a speech  in 
Stockholm  in  February  1945  Brandt  noted  that  „Unreserved  recognition  of the  crimes 
committed  by  Germans  and  in  the  name  of  Germany  on  other  peoples  is  the  first 
precondition of a healing [Gesundung] of the German people” (in Brandt  1970:  36). This 
conviction  lead  Brandt  to  apologise  to  the  Czechoslovak  nation  that  the  GDR  had 
participated  in  the  1968  occupation,  as  well  as  his  more  well-known  (and  more 
symbolically profound)  gesture  of kneeling  in  front of the  Warsaw-Ghetto  memorial  in 
December  1970.363

Redefining Germany-in-Europe thus required re-engaging the memory space created by 
the Third  Reich  and  disseminating the  new vision  of (Germany  in)  a Greater European 
Peace  Order.  The  Brandt  government  first  pursued  this  through  direct  (bilateral) 
engagement  with  key  nations 
the 
‘renunciation of the use of force’, which Brandt had pursued as foreign minister together 
with  Kiesinger.  As  soon  as  he  became  Chancellor,  the  talks  were  intensified  and,  in  a 
remarkable  speed  the  Brandt  government  negotiated  and  signed  treaties  with  Moscow 
(1970),  Warsaw  (1970),  and  the  GDR  (1972).364  Two  crucial  elements  were  required, 
however, to turn this  into an enduring project within the  Western  space.  First,  it needed

in  Eastern  Europe,  mainly  through 

talks  on 

362 That Brandt’s vision was appreciated in Eastern Europe is suggested by Jiri Dienstbier, one of 
the  most  prominent  dissidents  in  Czechoslovakia  in  the  1970s  and  80s,  who  prefaced  his  book 
entitled “Dreaming of Europe’  with the note that in thinking about the goal how to overcome the 
order of Yalta,  Brandt’s Ostpolitik was the only larger conception developed in the West “which 
reckoned with  a  Europe  other than the  one  to  which  we had  all  accustomed ourselves”  (in  Ash 
1993:  15).
363 On the symbolic power of that gesture, see Ash (1993: x); Markovits and Reich (1997:x).

to  resonate  with  the  partner  most  intimately  linked  with  the  FRG’s  unfolding  in  the 
Western  space,  America.  Second,  the  question  was  which  institution  was  suitable  to 
enable  the  successful  negotiation  of this  project,  specifically  whether  and  how  NATO 
could be made that institution. It is these questions the discussion now turns to.

Locating Friends in the West:  ‘Kennedy America’
As  the  friendship  lens  suggests,  Brandt’s  vision  and  transformative  agenda  of having 
Germany unfold  into  a  Greater  European  Peace  Order  was  not  created  in  isolation  but 
with support from Western friends.

Within  limits,  Britain  and  France  played  important  roles  in  Brandt’s  project  insofar  as 
both  could  accommodate  his  vision  of  a  Greater  Europe  and  also  provided  creative 
impulses.  The  attempt of the  Labour government under Harold  Wilson to bring Britain 
‘closer to  Europe’  was  supported  by  Brandt,  who  in  December  1961  noted  that  Social 
Democrats “always were of the opinion that one cannot imagine the free Europe without 
England” (in  Brandt  1971:  72)  and  in  the  following years  repeatedly  advocated  Britain 
joining the  EC  (Ibid.,  73,  129;  Brandt  1970:  2 1).365  For Brandt,  British  membership  in 
the  EC  was  a  central  element  in  building  a  Greater Europe.  The  connection  to  London 
remained  strong even  when  Wilson was  replaced  by  a  conservative  government  led  by 
Edward  Heath,  whom  Brandt  describes  as  someone  with  whom  he  confidently  shared 
‘European’ topics and a relationship “close to friendship” (Brandt  1976:  326).  However, 
despite British willingness to consider a future ‘in Europe’, London was not in a position 
from  where  it  could  significantly  engage  with  Bonn  in  building  a  Greater  Europe 
because  it  lacked  membership  in  the  EC  and  was  significantly  outranked  in  NATO  by 
the US.

While  France  remained  a  core  partner  in  the  process  of building  Germany-in-Greater- 
Europe,  for  Brandt cooperation  with  Charles  de  Gaulle  and  since  1969  with  Pompidou 
who,  in  Brandt’s  view,  was  continuing  Gaullist  policies  was  not  easy.  It  required 
navigating  between  the  French  desire  to  build  a  Europe  independent  from  the  US  and 
one  in  which  ‘Germany’  was  not  getting  too  strong  (Hoffmann  1964,  Bozo  2001).  De 
Gaulle’s  determination  to  create  a  European  ‘third  force’  under  French  leadership  and 
his  boycott  of  institutions  he  considered  not  supportive  of this  aim  affected  both  the

365 In a speech to the British parliament in March  1970, Brandt linked British  participation  in the 
project of “organising the peace” in Europe to the British democratic tradition and the memory of 
the second  World  War when  Britain  had “the power  [Kraft]  not to  let the  flame  of freedom  be 
extinguished  when  it  was  very  dark  on  the  continent”,  as  well  as  to  British  willingness  for 
understanding for Germany’s “special problems and anxiety over Berlin” (in Brandt 1971:  186).

233

Western  and  Eastern  dimensions of Brandt’s project of building a  ‘Greater Europe’.  On 
one side, de Gaulle’s  ‘empty chair’  in the EEC (Juli  1965 to February  1966), withdrawal 
from  NATO’s  integrated  military  structure  in  1966  and  the  veto  of  British  EEC 
membership  in  May  1967  were  seen  as  unhelpful to  strengthening Western  Europe.  On 
the  other side,  de  Gaulle was  one  of the  early protagonists  of ‘detente’  and  had  loosely 
advocated the  creation  of a European  security  system  ‘from  the  Atlantic to the  Ural’  in 
the  early  1960s.  His  increasing  contact  with  Moscow  and  the  three-step  model  from 
‘detente’  via  ‘entente’  to  ‘cooperation’  (Vahl  1979:  231)  was  an  important  factor  in 
opening  space  for  Kiesinger  and  Brandt  to  turn  away  from  Adenauer’s  path  (Bange 
2006).

The  key partner remained the US,  however. Already in  May  1949 Brandt noted that the 
reconstruction  of  Europe  was 
largely  depended  on  American  support,  speaking 
favourably  of the  Truman  administration  and  noticing  its  commitment  to  democracy, 
freedom,  and  internationalism  (Brandt  1971:  45).  While  in  these  early years  one  finds 
the  occasional  calls  from  Brandt  for  European  ‘independence’,  by the  time  he  held  the 
position  of  mayor  of  Berlin,  Brandt  was  convinced  of  the  importance  of  close 
partnership  with  the  US.  In  March  1963,  in  a  debate  over  the  Franco-German  Elysee 
Treaty, he warned Adenauer not to strengthen the bonds with  Paris at the expense of the 
relationship  with  Washington.  According 
is  vital 
[lebenswichtig].... not only... because America is the leading power of the West, but it is 
a  friendship  founded  in  the  dark  days  of the  Berlin  blockade...no  document  can  make 
changes to this friendship, this foundational  structure of the free West” (in Brandt  1971: 
75).  He  repeated  this  stance  in  a  television  address  on  President  Kennedy’s  death  in 
November  1963  where  Brandt  criticises  Adenauer’s  conception  of  European  order, 
specifically his focus on a ‘small Europe’.

friendship 

John  F.  Kennedy  played  a  crucial  role  in  Brandt’s  conception  of the  US  as  a  partner 
which  endured  long  after  the  US  President’s  death.  Although  there  were  also  signs  of 
dissonance,  discussed  below,  it  is  suggested  here that  it was  ‘Kennedy America’  which 
Brandt  was  looking  for  as  a  partner  and  hoped  to  build  Germany’s  future  with.  In 
addition  to  formally  supporting  German  unity,  this  ‘Kennedy  America’  was  composed 
of two elements which profoundly influenced Brandt’s vision of Germany-in-Europe.366

366  In  his  memoirs  Brandt  devotes  an  entire  chapter to  Kennedy,  the  only  person  for  whom  he 
does so (Brandt,  1976:  71-100).  On this relationship and  its  impact on  respective thinking about 
detente, see Hofmann (2006).

234

The  first  element  was  Kennedy’s  conception  of the  relationship  between  the  US  and 
Europe as a “creative partnership of equals” (Winand  1996:  139).  Invoking the  image of 
‘two  pillars’  carrying  the  Western  project  Brandt  repeatedly  referred  to  Kennedy’s 
speech  from  4  July  1962  which  renewed  the  view that  a  united  Europe  embodying the 
spirit  “which  gave  birth  to  the  American  Constitution”  was  “a  partner  with  whom  we 
can  deal on a basis of full  equality in all the great and burdensome tasks of building and 
defending  a  community  of  free  nations”.367  Although  Kennedy  never  imagined  US 
giving up  its  leadership position,  his  ‘two pillars’  metaphor represented the relationship 
between  the  US  and  Europe  as  one  of  equals  pursuing  a  common  project  or,  more 
precisely,  carrying  a  shared  roof of  ‘freedom’,  ‘unity’  and  ‘peace’.  After  Kennedy’s 
death  Brandt  declared  it  a  core  task  to  make  this  ‘active  partnership’  a  reality  “not 
merely  as  a partnership  of defense  but  going  far  beyond  that...as  a  partnership  of two 
world  powers  and  crystallisation  point of free  people”  (in  Brandt  1971:  110;  Brandt  in 
his  1962 Harvard speech, here p.  87). In an interview in February  1967 Brandt noted that 
“the politically organised  Europe we aim  at understands  itself as a partner of the United 
States and...as  a factor  in  the  stabilisation  of peace”,  adding that this  was  the  vision  of 
Kennedy and the “declared aim” of Johnson (in Brandt  1970:  3 1).368

The  second  element  was  Kennedy’s  forward-looking  optimism  and  courage  to  induce 
change  (Brandt  1976:  100).  Brandt  saw  not  only  a  president  who  had  vowed  in  his 
inauguration  speech  that  “we  shall  pay  any  price,  bear any  burden,  meet  any  hardship, 
support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty”.  He also 
saw  someone  his  own  age,  a  representative  of a  new  generation  with  whom  he  shared 
the ability to think beyond tradition and who inspired to open up  ‘new horizons’  (Brandt 
1976:  71).  In  an  almost  romantic  flourish,  Brandt  notes  Kennedy’s  youth,  energy, 
compassion,  and  courage  to  tackle  difficult  projects  and  heal  divisions  (Ibid.,  99f). 
Brandt’s perception  of Kennedy as  a representative of a courageous  America promising 
a  better  future  was  echoed  in  Kennedy’s  simultaneous  toning  down  of  the  anti­
communist position and advocacy an ‘activist’ or ‘transformative’ approach towards ‘the 
East’.369 After the Cuban missile crisis Kennedy chose a course of peaceful  engagement 
in  which  efforts  to  reduce tensions  with  Moscow through  negotiations  on  arms  control 
were  coupled  with  establishing  trade  relations  with  East  European  states  intended  to

367 See Kennedy (1962). For the context, see Winand (1993: Ch. 7).
368  Yet  he  also  knew  that  to  be  considered  equal,  the  US  expected  Europeans  to work  closer
together.  In  a  speech  in  Brussels  in  1964,  Brandt reminds  his  European  socialist colleagues that 
“we  are  valued  in  Washington  only  as  much  as  we  in  Europe  and  out of Europe  can achieve
together and contribute” to the common project (in Brandt  1971:  130).

progressively  detach them  from  the  Soviet Union  by  creating new  aspirations  (Winand 
1996:  364).  This  pursuit  of  an  active  strategy  of  gradual  transformation  stimulated 
Brandt’s thinking, as evident  in his  speeches at Harvard (1962) and Tutzing (1963) and 
influenced his conception of Ostpolitik (also Ash  1993: 258).

While Arne Hofmann (2006:  437) finds that the “general conceptual agreement between 
Brandt  and  Kennedy  was  extraordinary”,  he  also  shows  that  within  this  dynamic there 
were  important  differences.  This  concerned,  in  particular,  Kennedy’s  view  on  the 
necessity of recognising the  ‘status quo’, which  stood  in tension with his transformative 
outlook and  required  some adjustment on  Brandt’s  side  (Hofmann  2006:  440).  Because

Berlin Wall in August  1961, must be looked at in more detail.

is 

indicative  of 

The ‘Berlin Complex’
Even  after  the  termination  of the  occupation  statute,  the  Western  powers  continued  to 
hold  some  formal  and  informal  authority  in the  FRG,  in  particular when  it  came to  the 
use  of the  Bundeswehr.  Yet  it  was  the  unresolved  status  of Berlin  where  the  anxiety- 
producing  ‘Potsdam  complex’  was  most  strongly  felt.  The  city  remained  formally 
divided  into  four  zones  with  the  Occupation  Statute  still  in  force  and,  hence,  was  the 
place where the  four powers continued to  hold  ‘supreme authority’.  For Brandt,  who  as 
noted  earlier  lived  in  the  city  for  two  decades  after  the  war,  including  as  mayor,  the 
Potsdam  complex  became  the  ‘Berlin  complex’,  the  concern  that  negotiations  between 
Washington  and  Moscow  affecting  European  order  were  bypassing  Bonn  and  that  the 
two  sides  would  come  to  an  agreement  detrimental  to  the  vision  of having  Germany 
unified  in a Greater Europe.  Brandt experienced the utter powerlessness of the FRG vis- 
a-vis  the  occupying  powers  and,  in  particular,  the  potential  dissonance  between  his 
vision and the  one held  in  Washington  in  August  1961  when  he witnessed  the  building 
of the Berlin  Wall.370 Brandt begins his memoirs with an account of these days and was 
deeply  affected  by  the  event.  Berlin  was  a  highly  symbolic  place  of  historical 
significance  and,  in  Brandt’s  view,  was  the  likely  capital  of a  unified  Germany.  Most 
importantly it was the place where hope of overcoming the division was  still alive.  The 
unexpected building of the wall and its death-strip reversed that vision and turned Berlin 
into the  starkest symbol of the divide.  Bahr remarked the  ‘loss’  of the  Eastern  zone felt 
like  the  amputation  of a  leg  (Bahr  1996:  133ff).  Brandt  recalled  the  feeling  was  that

370  Bahr recalls  this  dissonance  became visible  already in  the  reactions of the  Western  Allies to 
the June  1957 uprising (Bahr  1996: 81).

“someone  had  lifted  the  curtain  to  show  us  an  empty  stage...we  have  been  stripped  of 
our illusions...which clung to something that had ceased to exist” (Brandt  1976:  17).

Central  to  Brandt’s  disillusionment  was  the  hesitant  American  reaction  to  the  event. 
Brandt had  placed high expectations  in earlier statements from US  officials  insisting on 
the  Allied  ‘rights’  in  Berlin,  which  to  him  meant that  the  city was  part  of the  Western 
project (Brandt  1976:  18).  Moreover, as noted  above Brandt thought highly of Kennedy 
who  had  linked  the  idea  of German  unity  with  Berlin  and  had  declared  it  a  valuable 
place in the  West.  Yet for three days after the wall  had gone up there was no substantial 
reaction  coming  out  of Washington,  and  then  only  after  a  strongly  worded  letter  from 
Brandt  voicing  his  frustration  and  in  which  he  noted  that  there  was  the  “danger  of a 
crisis  of trust  [ Vertrauenskrise]”  (Brandt  1976:  29).  Although  Kennedy  in  his  response 
expressed sympathy, also sending Vice President Johnson for a visit and deploying some 
additional American troops in the city, he made clear that the wall only manifested what 
was  ‘reality’.  Changing the  status quo would  require  a war which,  Kennedy noted,  was 
in  no-ones’ 
interest  (Bahr  1996:  136).  From  Kennedy’s  perspective  (as  well  as 
Adenauer) the building of the wall was an unfortunate part of the logic of the division of 
Europe.

Brandt  did  not  accept  this  assessment  of the  inevitability  of the  division.  For  him  the 
building of the wall was a “human tragedy” deserving a reaction of anger (Brandt,  1976: 
16f)>  and  he  began  to  have  doubts  over  the  American  commitment  to  the  project  of 
German/European  unity:  “If Berlin  as  the  capital  in  waiting  is  put  into  question,  what 
would  then  be the  perspectives  for Germany as  a  whole?” (Ibid.,  25).  Recognising that 
even  an  energetic  visionary  like  Kennedy  was  willing  to  accept  the  status  quo,  Brandt 
adjusted his horizon of expectations vis-a-vis the Western project (see also Merseburger, 
2002:  396ff;  Ash  1993:  58ff).  In  a  Bundestag  speech  from  December  1961  entitled 
‘sober  assessment  on  the  state  of the  nation’,  Brandt  emphasizes  that  the  FRG  must 
bring its own contribution towards ‘peace’, even noting that the FRG must put forward a 
vision of peace which “will relieve our friends and win new friends” (1971:  68f). While 
for  Brandt  the  US  remained  the  most  important  partner  with  whom  Germany’s  future 
could  be  built,  the  Berlin  wall  episode  had  made  it  clear  that  new  initiatives  were 
necessary  for  re-shaping  the  path  through  which  Germany-in-Europe  was  to  unfold. 
Looking back, he noted this episode forced him to recognise “that traditional formulas of 
Western  politics  had  proven 
reality 
[wirklichkeitsfremd]“ (Brandt,  1976:  17).

As  Hofmann  (2006:  440ff.)  shows,  Brandt  adapted 
to  Kennedy’s  emphasis  on 
recognising  the  ‘status  quo’  and  combined  it  with  his  transformative  outlook.  The 
resulting dialectic was reflected in his speeches at Harvard (1962) and in Tutzing (1963) 
and became the credo of Ostpolitik',  ‘recognising the status quo in order to change it’. By 
attributing  this  dialectic  to  Kennedy,  Brandt  not  only  skilfully  reconciled  the  tension 
between  (i)  accepting the  status  quo,  including the  GDR,  which  meant the  death  of the 
Hallstein  doctrine371  and  was  widely  seen  as  undermining the  idea that  there  was  only 
one  authentic  vision  for Germany-in-Europe,  and  (ii)  maintaining the  latter.  It  kept the 
impression  that  the  US  and  Germany  were  still  investing  in  the  same  project,  thereby 
sustaining  the  friendship.  This  is  testified  in  Brandt’s  insistence  later  on  that  Kennedy 
had  not  undermined  but  continued  to  support  his  vision,  which  an  in  large  parts  be 
attributed  to  Kennedy’s  willingness  to  reassure  Germans  of  commitment  to  a  ‘free 
Berlin’  through  his  famous  speech  in  June  1963,  at  the  15h  anniversary  of the  air  lift, 
declaring that he also was a ‘Berliner’.372

Johnson: The Fading of ‘Kennedy America’
Johnson’s  link  to  Kennedy  was  sufficient  to  at  least  maintain  the  impression  that 
Kennedy-America  was  still  ‘there’  and  Kennedy’s  approach  of  gradual  engagement 
carried  over  into  Johnson’s  suggestion  to  build  bridges  in  Europe  (Froman,  1991:  26; 
Bange,  2008:  107).  In  a  speech  from  October  1966  ‘Making  Europe  Whole:  An 
Unfinished  Task’,  Johnson  not  only  reiterated  Kennedy’s  image  of the  two  pillars  but 
also  noted  that  the  US  expected  Europe  “to  move  more  confidently  in  peaceful 
initiatives  toward  the  East”  and  to  “provide  a  framework  within  which  a  unified 
Germany could  be  a  full  partner without  arising  ancient  fears”  (in  Winand  1996:  364). 
Johnson  remained  supportive  of  integration  processes  taking  place  in  the  EC  and 
continued  to  see  ‘Europe’  as  the  key  political  partner  for  building  the  Western  world. 
When  leaving office,  he reportedly was disappointed that Western  Europe had not come 
closer to unity as he considered it “essential to have an effective partner if the US role in 
the world is to be stabilized in the long term” (in Lundestad,  1993:  82).

371 On the Hallstein doctrine (the politics of non-recognition of the GDR), see Gray, 2003.
372  Kennedy  skilfully  reconciled  the  American  commitment  to  the  shared  narrative  when  he 
declared  “All  free  man,  wherever they  may  live,  are  citizens  of Berlin  and,  therefore,  as  a  free 
man,  I  take pride  in  the words,  Ich  bin  ein  Berliner”.  Brandt notes the  enthusiastic  reception  of 
Kennedy’s  visit  and  describes  the  speech  as  a  highly  emotional  moment  in  which  the  US 
president  provided  the  perspective  of a  “just  peace”  (72f).  Looking  back,  Brandt  defended  the 
late  Kennedy  against the  claim  that  he  had  tried  to  seek  agreement  with  the  SU  ‘at the  cost  of 
Germany’  (in  Brandt  1971:  109).  On  the  importance o f ‘Berlin’  in the  US  narrative,  see  Risse- 
Kappen (1995).

238

However,  the  notion  of  the  EC  as  a  ‘third  force’  had  become  less  attractive  in 
Washington  since  de  Gaulle  gave this term  a  new  meaning.  Observing EC  institutional 
reform  and  the  establishment  of  the  Commission  and  the  Council  of  Ministers,  a 
memorandum  from  the  State  Department’s  European  bureau  to  Dean  Rusk  from 
February  1965  recommended  continued  support  further  integration  along  a  ‘federalist’ 
design, but also noted that EC members must not create a “small Europe” or ignore “the 
crucial collateral policy of Atlantic partnership” (in Lundestad,  1998:  78).  In response to 
de  Gaulle’s  attempt  to  weaken  the  Atlantic  framework  and  reduce  US  influence  on 
building  European  order  good  relations  with  Bonn  only  gained  in  importance  (also 
Winand  1996, Ch. 9.). To ensure that the EC was not ‘closing o ff  Western Europe from 
the  US,  the  Johnson  administration  began  to  invest  in  the  ‘Atlantic’  approach  by 
confirming  its  commitment  to  NATO  and  emphasizing  it  as  the  primary  forum  for 
consultation.  Johnson’s  strategy was to  “bind the Atlantic  nations  closer together  [and] 
support,  as  best as we can,  the  long term  movement towards  unity  in  Western  Europe” 
(in Lundestad,  1998:  80f).

Johnson’s  support  for  ‘European  unity’  mainly  focused  on  Western  Europe  rather than 
Greater  Europe.  Enlargement  in  Washington  meant  British  EC  membership  and  not 
expanding  European  order towards  the  East.  If the  division  of Europe/Germany  was  a 
result of ‘tensions’  between the superpowers, these tensions needed to be reduced before 
divisions  could  be  overcome.  Maintaining  a  peaceful  Europe  thus  meant  keeping 
Western  Europe  close  to  the  US  and  improving  relations  with  Moscow,  rather  than 
actively pursuing a transformation of European order.  While the Johnson administration 
maintained  that  overcoming  the  division  of  Europe  was  desirable  and  that  it  was 
committed to the  idea of German unification,  “particularly  as  a means of strengthening 
ties”  to  the  FRG,  “its  immediacy  disappeared”  (Froman,  1991:  33).  Oliver  Bange’s 
(2006)  finding  that  there  is  little  to  no  evidence  for  any  substantial  ‘bridge  building’ 
projects  under Johnson  is exemplified  by George Ball’s testimony to the  Senate  in June 
1966 
to  explain  what  was  meant  by  ‘bridge  building’.  Ball  basically  repeated 
Adenauer’s  mantra  by  noting  that  the  primary  focus  was  on  strengthening  Western 
Europe  which  would then  function  “as  a very powerful  magnet” to  Eastern  Europe  and 
that,  specifically,  German  unification  would  be  achieved  by  integrating  the  FRG  in  a 
system  of Western  unity  whose  magnetic  forces  would  be  the  greater  the  closer  it  is 
connected  to  the  US  (Winand,  1996:  364).  For  the  medium  term,  a  policy  of strength 
meant strengthening the status quo (Thomas  1997).

NATO’s ‘Harmel report’ and the Ambiguity of Detente
The  differences  emerging  between  German  and  American  ideas  of  ordering  Europe 
(transformation  versus  status  quo)  were  managed  until  1969  by  Kiesinger  moderating 
Brandt’s views and Johnson embodying the image of Kennedy-America. They also were 
tamed  by  an  important  adjustment  to  the  Atlantic  Alliance  as  the  institutional  frame 
through  which  to  order  the  ‘shared’  Western  space  with  the  help  of  a  new  strategic 
document.

Bonn  was  eager  to  legitimize  its  move  towards  Ostpolitik  through  NATO,  and  in  a 
speech  to  the  WEU  assembly  in  January  1967,  Brandt  described  NATO  as  “a  living 
organism  which  adapts  to  changing  demands  (Anforderungen)”  (in  Brandt,  1970:  16). 
Support came from NATO Secretary General Manlio Brosio who  in  1966  noted that the 
Alliance  was  loosing  its  shared  sense  of  a  mission  and  its  function  as  a  center  for 
consultation.  In  addition  to the  French  exit from  military  integration  and  Washington’s 
focus  on  Vietnam,  Brosio  criticized  that  the  ‘detente’  policies  pursued  in  Western 
capitals  were  conducted  without  coordination,  let  alone  consultation  (Bagnato,  2006: 
174-177). Upon the initiative of Belgian foreign minister Pierre Harmel a working group 
was put in place with the task to come up with a document which would ensure NATO’s 
viability  as  a  forum  for  pursuing  a  common  project.  The  resulting  document  from 
December  1967  was  entitled  “The  Future  Tasks  of the  Alliance”  and  informally  called 
the Harmel Report.m

From  Bonn’s  perspective  the  Report  was  important  in  manifesting  that  “the  ultimate 
political  purpose  of  the  Alliance  is  to  achieve  a  just  and  lasting  peaceful  order  in 
Europe” and that to this end “the possibility of a crisis cannot be excluded as long as the 
central  political  issues  in  Europe,  first  and  foremost  the  German  question,  remain 
unsolved.”  It then  combines  two views on  how this  “uncertainty”  should  be  dealt with, 
namely  (i)  through  the  maintenance  of  “a  suitable  military  capability  to  assure  the 
balance of forces” to create “a climate of stability” in which (ii) the Alliance can “pursue 
the  search  for  progress  towards  a  more  stable  relationship  in  which  the  underlying 
political  issues  can  be  solved”.  As  such,  the  report  states  that  “military  security  and  a 
policy  of  detente  are  not  contradictory  but  complementary”.  Furthermore,  the  report 
recognises that the German question is an open one and declares

“no final and stable settlement in Europe is possible without a solution of
the  German  question  which  lies  at  the  heart  of  present  tensions  in

373 North Atlantic Council (1967).  See also  Hafitendom (1985:  117-123; 2006:  107-113).

Europe.  Any  such  settlement  must  end  the  unnatural  barriers  between 
Eastern  and  Western  Europe,  which  are  most  clearly  and  cruelly 
manifested in the division of Germany”

It  goes  on  stating  that,  consequently,  the  Allies  would  examine  “suitable  policies 
designed  to  achieve  a  just  and  stable  order  in  Europe,  to  overcome  the  division  of 
Germany  and  to  foster  European  security”.  While  stating that  “the  participation  of the 
USSR and the USA will  be necessary to achieve a settlement of the political problems in 
Europe”  the  report  reiterates  that  NATO  was  the  primary  forum  for  dealing  with 
European  order,  noting  “the  way to  peace  and  stability  in  Europe  rests  in  particular on 
the  use  of the  Alliance  constructively  in  the  interest  of detente”.  Here  the  report  also 
describes  NATO  as  “an  effective  forum  and  clearing  house  for  the  exchange  of 
information and views” and  recognises that “to this end the practice of frank and timely 
consultations  needs  to  be  deepened  and  improved”,  in  particular  when  discussing  “the 
problem of German reunification and its relationship to a European settlement”.

The  achievement  of the  Harmel  Report  was  the  prominent  place  it  attributed  to  this 
ambiguous  term:  detente.  To  be  sure,  this  did  not  ease  the  frustration  of Brosio,  for 
whom  detente  remained  a  “political  mirage”,  no  more  than  “a  word,  a  smoke”  (in 
Bagnato,  2006:  180).  Yet  ambiguity  was  intrinsic  to  the  term  since  it  had  entered  the 
political discourse of the West in the early  1960s, some described it as a “mood of spirit” 
(Seabury,  1973:  62).  On  the  most  general  level,  detente  meant a  relaxation  of tensions 
and  captured  the  spirit  of  cooperation  for  ‘peace’.  It  stood  for  all  kinds  of  policies 
intended  to  reduce  tensions  between  ‘East’  and  ‘West’,  that  is,  any  motion  “from  the 
pole  of war to  the  pole  of peace”  (Kohler,  1981:  41)  and  as  leading “to  a more normal 
situation” meaning ‘more peaceful’  (Maresca  1984 :  3).374 By inserting a commitment to 
‘detente’  into  NATO’s  task  catalogue  the  Harmel  Report  provided  the  framework  into 
which  various  national  detente  policies  could  be  integrated  (Haftemdom  1985:  119; 
Thomas  1997:  88-101).  It  allowed  policymakers  in  Bonn  and  in  Washington  to 
understand  detente  as  leading  to  a  ‘more  peaceful  Europe’  and  to  agree  that  it  was  a 
vision worth investing in.

Yet there was the question what a  ‘peaceful  Europe’  looked  like.  For Bonn the value of 
the  Harmel  Report was  its commitment to overcoming German division/the  ‘unnatural’

374  One  scholar tracing the  development of the  idea of ‘detente’  in  US  administrations  from  the 
1950s  onwards  notes  it  was  “among  the  most  contentious  terms  in  diplomatic  discourse” 
(Froman,  1991:  1).  Indeed,  it  was  not  always  clear  whether  detente  was  replacing  or  refining 
containment. On the difficulty of defining detente, see also Frei (1981); Hanhimaki (2000).

barriers  in  Europe,  thus  allowing  Brandt  to  interpret  the  ‘European  settlement’  a  as 
Greater  European  Order  and  ‘detente’  as  accommodating  a  transformative  Ostpolitik. 
Among German policymakers,  this  made the  Harmel Report the  central  reference  point 
for NATO’s  purpose  for  decades  to  come,  indeed  as  Ash  points  out  it  was  considered 
“the bible of East-West relations” (Ash  1993: 4 1).375 However, in Washington a peaceful 
European  order  meant  primarily  reducing  the  possibility  of  conflict  and  reaching  a 
mutually agreeable level of ‘coexistence’  with the Soviet Union rather than transforming 
the  European  space.  In the  words  of one  US  official  the  report was  “to  fill  in  a  mental 
picture  of the Atlantic system  we  wish  to  build”,  which  basically  meant to  solidify the 
cohesion of the  Western  space and to complement a  ‘peace through strength’  with talks 
with Moscow about arms control (Thomas  1997:  89f., emphasis added), displayed in the 
Harmel Reports’ emphasis on stability/stable relationships rather than change.

Pushing the Limits of NATO
While  the  vague  meaning  of  ‘detente’  provided  sufficient  manoeuvring  space  for 
German and American policymakers to continue  speaking of a shared  commitment to a 
common  ‘Western’  project  pursued  through  NATO,  both  sides  saw  limits  of  the 
institution concerning its ability to embed respective narratives o f ‘world building’.

In  Bonn,  Egon  Bahr  most  clearly  identified  the  limits  of the  Harmel  Report  for  the 
German  narrative.  He  noted  that  despite  its  endorsement  of  detente  the  emphasis  on 
stability/stable  relationships  cemented  the  division  of  Europe  into  two  blocs  and 
displayed  the  limits  of NATO  as  that  institution  for  building  Germany  in  a  Greater 
Europe (Bahr  1996:  228). As a consequence, Bahr advocated an alternative institution to 
NATO.  In  June  1968  his  policy  planning  staff produced  an  important  paper  entitled 
“Conception  of European  Security”  which  laid  out  three  visions  of a  European  peace 
order  achieved  through  (i)  significant  reduction  of  tensions  between  the  two  pacts 
through 
through  gradual 
institutionalisation  of a  common  security  conference,  and  (iii)  replacing the  two  pacts 
through a European security system supported by both superpowers without having them 
as  members.376  The  paper  noted  that  the  first  option  was  the  most  likely  and  would  at 
least keep the German question  open  and the  second would  be  desirable for Germany’s 
neighbours  but  would  offer  little  perspective  for  overcoming  the  division.  The  third 
option  would  open  up  the  possibility  to  fundamentally  reorder  Europe  and  “create  a

two  pacts 

reductions, 

arms 

(ii)

376 Tellingly, the three security  systems  were discussed  in purely political terms,  with  the report 
noting that it had “abstained from the presentation of military aspects” (in Hacke, 2003:  155).

political  basis for the reunification  of Germany and a European  peace  order” and  be the 
best  scenario  from  a  German  perspective  (Bahr  1996:  227f.).  Although  he  conceded  it 
was  also  the  least  likely to  happen,  this  third  version  was  the  one  Bahr  recommended. 
While  he  knew  that  the  idea  of building  Greater  Europe  through  an  institution  from 
which the US was excluded was not acceptable for either Brandt or Kiesinger, the paper 
was effective in making clear the need to go beyond the Atlantic Alliance, a view shared 
by Brandt (Hacke 2003:  154).

Bahr’s  paper  not  only  coincided  with  a  1967  French  study  laying  out  de  Gaulle’s 
tripartite  ‘detente-entente-cooperation’  idea  (Bahr,  1996:  228;  Vahl,  1979:  230f.),  and 
his third version resonated with the idea of a European Security Conference proposed by 
the  Warsaw Pact.  A  1954  proposal  from  Moscow attempting to reduce US  control  over 
the  FRG  and  prevent  the  latter’s  entry  into  NATO  had  been  taken  up  by  the  Polish 
foreign minister Adam Rapacki in October  1957 and modified into a proposal to create a 
nuclear-free  zone  in  Central  Europe.  Repeated  by  diplomats  and  scholars  calling  for 
some sort of pan-European security  system, by  1966 the  idea of a European  conference 
had  become “a recurring theme”  in  statements coming from the Warsaw  Pact (Maresca 
1984:  5).  As  of yet,  neither  Washington  nor  Bonn  had  responded  to  these  proposals 
because they implied participation  of the GDR and  only observer status  for the US,  and 
because they  made the  inviolability of existing borders  a precondition  for talks.  NATO 
members  only  confirmed  their  general  commitment  to  detente  in  the  ‘signal’  of 
Reykjavik  from  June  1968  in  which  they  agreed  to  discuss  mutual  and  balanced  force 
reductions (MBFR).

In  Washington,  the  Harmel  Report  was  interpreted  not  only  as  a  document  of detente 
which  confirmed  US  leadership  in  ordering  (stabilizing)  Western  Europe,  but  also  as 
approving  the  spatial  extension  of the  Western  project  beyond  Europe.  By  noting  that 
“the North  Atlantic  Treaty  Area cannot  be  treated  isolated  from  the  rest  of the  world”, 
that  “crises  and  conflicts  arising  outside  the  area  may  impair  its  security”  the  report 
indirectly  sanctioned  US  military  engagement  in  Vietnam.  This  tacit  widening  of the 
scope  to  the  ‘global’  hinted  at  later  attempts  of using  the  institution  for  ‘out  of area’ 
missions,  discussed  in  the  next  chapter.  Moreover,  in  the  view  of  Secretary  of  State 
Dean  Rusk  it  encouraged  members  to  cooperate  over  security  issues  outside  the  treaty 
area without requiring them “to go at the speed of the slowest ship” (in  Sherwood  1990: 
133f.).  While  the  Vietnam  engagement  gradually  expanded  the  American  experienced 
space,  for  the  present  purpose  the  German  reception  must  be  noted  because  the 
difference to Adenauer’s reaction to the Korean War is telling.

Vietnam is not Korea: Brandt*s Silence
Expanding the  Western project through NATO beyond  Europe did  not meet enthusiasm 
in  Bonn.  Initially,  the  narrative coming out of Washington was  reminiscent of ‘Korea’, 
justifying the engagement with the familiar formula of Vietnam being a test for Western 
steadfastness  in support of freedom  loving people. The engagement was to secure  South 
Vietnamese independence and to demonstrate US determination to oppose the expansion 
of communist order, there or ‘elsewhere’  (Gaddis, 2005 (1982): 264). This narrative was 
adopted by Kiesinger at first; however, when the US stepped up its military involvement 
the  German  support  did  not  go  beyond  offering  a  medical  vessel  in  February  1967 
(Schoellgen  1999:  76).  In stark contrast to Adenauer’s leading voice two decades earlier 
in  merging  US  engagement  in  Korea  with  ordering  Europe,  this  time  the  German 
government  joined  other  NATO  allies  resisting  US  attempts  to  make  Vietnam  “a 
genuine NATO  issue”  (Nuenlist  and  Locher:  13).  As  Elizabeth  Sherwood  notes  on  the 
subject of the war in Vietnam “NATO remained mute” (Sherwood,  1990:  133).

to  become  guilty 

in  sharing 

the  American  failure 

Brandt’s  silence  was  an  attempt  of not  fostering  the  dissonance  in  German-American 
world-building  narratives.  While  the  Chancellor  privately  noted  that  he  did  not  see 
Berlin  being defended  in  Vietnam,  in  public  he  only  came  up  with  vague  formulations 
on the government’s position which were often dropped under the pressure of his foreign 
and  defence  ministers  (Merseburger  2002:  562,  626).  When  in  his  1973  governmental 
declaration he refused to criticize US  bombing campaigns Brandt was heavily criticized 
within  his  party  and  in  public.  The  SPD-intemal  newspaper  asked  “Why  is  Brandt 
silent?”  and  a  list  of  150  German  academics  and  public  intellectuals  called  on  the 
chancellor  not 
in  Vietnam 
(Merseburger 2002:  670). The Chancellor’s silence did not just stem from not wanting to 
openly  criticize  a  friend  in  trouble;  it  expressed  a  fundamental  ambiguity  Vietnam 
brought into the German-American relationship:  On the one hand,  he saw Johnson as an 
extension  of ‘Kennedy-America’  pursuing  the  ‘transformative’  agenda  which  also  had 
inspired  him and  he acknowledged the Nixon administration’s difficulty of withdrawing 
from the conflict.  He also did not want to be associated with the  increasingly harsh  anti- 
American undertone found in the critique voiced  in Germany, going as far as associating 
US activities with those of the Third Reich (Mueller and Risse-Kappen  1987:  76-78). On 
the  other  hand,  Brandt  was  unable  to  positively  insert  ‘America-in-Vietnam’  into  the 
shared  project  of building  the  West.  The  forceful  extension  if the  Western  space  into 
South-East  Asia  did  not  fit  with  the  ‘peaceful  change’  agenda  of  Ostpolitik,  most 
obviously as American military activity was  irreconcilable with the  pacifist principle of

244

the  German  narrative.  Indeed,  the  escalation  appeared  as  a  failure  in  US  judgment, 
generating doubt about Washington’s virtue and its contribution to the Western project.

Nixon/Kissinger:  Reorienting America-in-the-World
When  Richard  Nixon  took  over the  White  House  in  1969,  the  Vietnam  experience  had 
begun  to  bring  uncertainty  into the  American narrative. This  uncertainty  arose over the 
question what the US  was doing  in Vietnam, which  had gradually evolved  into a costly 
military  campaign  which  did  not  succeed  and  had  become  questionable  on  moral 
grounds  at  home  and  abroad.  In  addition,  with  Western  Europeans  getting  stronger 
economically  and  the  Soviet  Union  apparently  reaching  ‘strategic  parity’,  there  was  a 
general  feeling  of American  power  in  decline.  To  Nixon  the  direction  of US  foreign 
policy  was 
in  1968  called 
“philosophical  deepening”  (in  Gaddis,  2005:  275).  This  deepening,  that  is,  the  Nixon 
administration’s  conception  of America-in-the-world  and  the  place  of Germany/Europe 
took  in  it,  was  significantly  shaped  by  National  Security  Advisor,  and  after  September 
1973  Secretary of State,  Henry Kissinger.377

for  reorientation,  or  what  Kissinger 

in  dire  need 

In particular when  it came to grand strategy and the US approach to ‘detente’  in Europe, 
Kissinger was the  leading thinker and  practitioner.  His academic background made him 
well  equipped  to  come  up  with  a  “conceptually  coherent”  (Gaddis)  narrative  of 
America’s  place  in  the  world,  which  he  did  by  resorting  to  ‘realist’  principles  to 
conceive  of the  world  as  one  of ‘great  powers’  (Gaddis  2005:  272ff).  Specifically,  he 
saw the US unfolding in a ‘pentagonal’  world populated by the United  States, the Soviet 
Union,  Western  Europe,  Japan  and  China.  According  to  the  model,  relations  among 
these  entities  were  facilitated  by  a  common  interest  for  ‘security’  and  pledge  to  non­
intervention.  Ideology  was  to  play  a  reduced  role  in  judging  others,  there  was  no 
‘communist block’, and no need to change the internal order of others; that is, there was 
to  be  no transformative  agenda.  Vietnam  was  to  be  reduced  to  “a  small  peninsula  on  a 
major continent” (in Gaddis, 2005:  275) without greater value for America. What Nixon 
liked  to  called  a  ‘structure  of peace’  was  achievable  in  this  world  through  balancing 
coalitions  and  deals  struck  among  the  great  powers.  According  to  Gaddis,  Nixon  took 
his conception of the condition of peace from Kissinger’s book  ‘A world restored’  when 
noting in a  Time  interview  in  1972,  “the  only time  in  history of the world  that we  have

377 On Kissinger’s influence,  see Kohl (1995);  Hanimaki (2004);  Dallek (2007).  Oddly, the latter 
two  contain  very  little  on  Kissinger’s  view  of  Europe  and  the  tensions  with  Germany,  in 
particular.

245

had  any  extended  period  of  peace...is  when  there  has  been  a  balance  of power”  (in 
Gaddis 2005:  278).

Although  there  was  a  need  to  bring  more  certainty  into  America’s  unfolding,  the 
theoretical  lens  applied  here  suggests  that  Kissinger’s  ability  to  ‘rethink’  America-in- 
the-world,  that  is,  his  ability  to  change  the  American  narrative,  was  limited.  As  noted 
earlier,  the phenomenological  perspective holds that one cannot withdraw from  a world 
once disclosed and cannot strip  it of values/meaning. Thus, while Kissinger’s  frame (as 
presented by Gaddis) was useful  for providing the Nixon administration  with  a strategy 
to withdraw militarily from Vietnam, it did not change the fact that ‘Vietnam’ became a 
significant experience in the memory space of the American biography.

Most  important,  while  Kissinger’s  ‘realist’  model  suggests  a  world  without  friendship, 
the lens applied here points attention to the fact that this was not the case.  For the Nixon 
administration the  building of a meaningful  Western  space  containing  ‘Europe’  and  the 
seeking  of intimate  bonds  with  certain  European  counterparts  remained  central  to  the 
agenda  of  manifesting  ‘America-in-the-world’.  As  Gaddis  notes,  while  according  to 
Kissinger relations were to be “purged of (their) sentimental and emotional components” 
and instead build upon “those common interests” of survival and security” he also added 
“a congenial  international  environment” to the  list (Gaddis, 2005:  277). The  meaning of 
‘congenial’  is open to interpretation, yet that Nixon was very much looking for friends is 
noted by Kissinger himself when he recalls that the President was eager to revitalise the 
special relationship with Britain (under Heath):  “[Nixon]  wanted nothing so much as an 
intimate  collaboration  of  a  kind  he  would  grant  to  no  other  foreign  leader”  and 
especially  wanted  Britain  to  be  this  “kindred  spirit”  whom  he  would  “not  need 
constantly  to  buttress,  and  from  whom  we  might  learn  a  great  deal”  (Kissinger,  1979: 
932f.).  This  unsuccessful  attempt to  strengthen  bonds  with  Britain378  can  be  explained 
with  the  administration’s  discomfort  with  Brandt’s  course.  Before  outlining  the

Keeping  *Europe ’ Close
For  Kissinger  the  US  relationship  with  ‘Europe’  was  that  of an  ‘uneasy  alliance’.  He 
recalls  that  Washington  looked  back  in  nostalgia to  US-‘European’  cooperation  during 
the  time  of Marshall  Plan,  which  was  seen  as  a  time  of harmonious  relations  where

378 When London turned down the offer for a special relationship Nixon was greatly disappointed 
according to Kissinger (1979: 933).

246

American  moral  leadership  had  evoked  “spontaneous  and  authentic  consensus”  from 
Europeans (Kissinger:  1979:  380).  This nostalgia was an  indicator that Washington was 
not quite happy with the ‘Europe’  it was dealing with now. Kissinger captured this basic 
discontent  when  noting  “Europe  was  proceeding  toward  political  unity -   if not  always 
along the  route we  favored”  (Ibid.,  381).  The  kind  of route  he  favoured,  of course,  was 
one  in  which  ‘Europe’  was  supportive  of  the  multipolar  ‘structure  of  peace’  he 
envisioned.  Yet  as  ‘Europe’  was  a  valued  space  the  ordering  of which  was  part  of the 
Western project, Kissinger’s attempt to reduce it to a ‘pole’ was beset by ambiguity.

To begin with, the Nixon administration decided to take a “low profile” on the project of 
European  unity  and  wanted  to  stay  out  of  “intra-European  quarrels”,  pretending  to 
pursue  an  approach  based  on  concern  for  “what  the  Europeans  want  for  themselves” 
(Kissinger,  1979:  390).  While this gave the impression that Washington had  lost interest 
in  the  European  project,  this  was  not  the  case.  Rather than  being  indifferent  about  the 
direction  ‘Europe’  was  taking,  Kissinger preferred that to  maintain  a  European  order  it 
could  understand.  The  tension  arising  out  of  not  wanting  to  engage  questions  of 
European  integration  but  at  the  same  time  wanting  ‘Western  Europe’  to  remain  a 
familiar space was visible in two ways.

First,  while  in  Kissinger’s  pentagonal  world  Western  Europe  was  a  ‘unit’,  he  did  not 
really  want  it  to  be  one.  Indeed,  as  Lundestad  (1998,  Ch.  8)  points  out,  the  Nixon 
administration shut the door to the ‘Europeanists’  and was the first administration which 
did  not  fully  support  the  vision  of European  unity.  When  testifying  to  the  Senate  in 
1966, Kissinger noted that he would prefer a confederal Europe (i.e. the way it currently 
was)  over  a  federal  one  because  the  former  would  permit  the  US  to  maintain  its 
influence “at many centers” while a more united Europe might become more  ‘Gaullist’, 
that is, take an anti-American  stance.  With his suggestion that Anti-Americanism might 
become the  “one  cohesive  bond”  among  Europeans,  Kissinger  departed  from  the  view 
that  a  more  united  Europe  would  remain  a  natural  partner  of the  US  (Kissinger  1979: 
390).

Second, while Kissinger did  not want to create an  ‘organic’  bond to ‘Europe’, he wanted 
it to  stay  close  to  the  US.  In  1966  Kissinger expressed  his  discomfort with  the  idea  of 
forming some sort of Atlantic community and  noted that  his “instinct” was that Europe 
and the US would work together for “common interests” without being “organically tied 
together”  (in  Winand  1996:  363).  In  a  meeting with  the  British  prime  minister,  Nixon 
noted that he would  like to  see Britain  in  a “strong” Europe which was  independent but

247

“going parallel with the United States” (in Kissinger  1979: 418). That the US conception 
of an  ‘independent’  Europe was ambivalent is also exemplified  by a report to Congress 
from February  1970 in which the Nixon administration advocated its  ‘strategy for peace’ 
and  noted  that the  US  could  not  detach  itself from  Europe just  like  it  could  not detach 
itself from Alaska. In other words, ‘Western Europe’ was expected to remain an intimate 
part of the Western space.

To  keep  it  there,  the  Nixon  administration  further  endorsed  the  building  of  ‘Europe’ 
through  NATO.  It  reacted  positively  to  a  proposal  by  Britain’s  Minister  of Defense, 
Denis Healy, from  March  1969 for creating a  ‘European’  group within NATO.  Whereas 
some  were  concerned  that  such  a  European  caucus  might divide  the  Atlantic  Alliance, 
Kissinger was  “generally  favourable”  of European  attempts  “to  create  a  more coherent 
voice  within  NATO”  because,  in  his  view,  “there  was  no  conceivable  contingency  in 
which  Europe  would  be  better  off without  American  support”  (Kissinger  1979:  385, 
emphasis added).  The  conception that NATO  allies were  engaged  in  a common  project 
also  was  visible  in  the  ‘burden  sharing’  debates.  These  were  not  merely  about  the  US 
trying to get Europeans to  invest more  in  military capabilities  in the  current of the  new 
NATO  strategy  of  ‘flexible  response’  and  pressure  by  Congress  to  cut  defense 
expenditures.379  Like  his  predecessors,  Nixon  used  this  as  a  lever  to  get  Western 
Europeans  to  help  the  US  with  its  balance  of payments  and  other  economic  problems 
(Lundestad  1998:  102f;  Duke,  1993).  At  bottom  the  White  House  never  intended  to 
withdraw  US  troops  from  Europe  because  their presence  provided  an  effective  lever to 
exert influence over any order-building enterprise (Kissinger  1979:  393ff.).380

Hence,  Kissinger  in  a  memo  to  Nixon  from  March  1970  argued  that  policy  towards 
Europe  should  adhere  to  three  principles:  (i)  to  remain  ‘sober’  when  dealing  with  the 
Soviet Union  so  Europeans  would  not  “grow to  fearful  of a US-Soviet deal”,  (ii)  to  be 
‘meticulous’  in  consultation  with  NATO  allies  so  they  could  “be  sure  that  their  vital 
interests  would  be  protected”,  and  (iii)  to  avoid  unilateral  decisions  of  withdrawing 
forces  from  Europe  to  avoid  any  “tendencies  of  submission  to  the  Soviet  Union” 
(Kissinger  1979:  382).  These points show that Kissinger was not only well aware of the 
Bonn’s  ‘Potsdam complex’, that is,  of being  ‘left out’  in vital  decisions  about Europe’s

379 In the US this strategic shift was neither new, nor was it clear what exactly ‘flexible response’ 
meant militarily (Kissinger 1979: 393, 398).
380 This  was  highlighted  in  the  debate  around the Mansfield  amendment from  May  1971, which 
(once  again)  demanded  to  cut  US  forces  in  Europe  by  half.  The  White  House  defeated  the 
proposal by gathering the support of old pro-European luminaries such as Acheson,  McCloy, and 
Ball.  Nixon  also  asked  Brandt to  issue  a statement warning that  US  withdrawal  would  leave the 
impression that “the United States is on  its way out of Europe” (Kissinger  1979: 938ff.).

emerging in the dissonance with the Brandt government.

Discomfort with  ‘Brandt Germany’
The  Nixon  administration  continued  to  see  Germany  as  playing  a  central  role  in  the 
making of European order. Kissinger noted (and presumably not only with the hindsight 
of 25 years): “There were only three powers capable of disrupting the postwar status quo 
in  Europe -  the two  superpowers  and  Germany” (Kissinger,  1994:  735f.).  He was  also 
aware  of Bonn’s  “unfulfilled  national  aims”,  specifically that unification  would  always 
be an  overarching aim that would be difficult to achieve  in  a divided  Europe (Kissinger 
1979:  96ff).  Yet  while  German  unification  may  have  been  desirable  in  principle,  in 
Kissinger’s  world  Germany-in-Europe  was  to  remain  a  stable  space.381  As  he  put  it 
diplomatically, the Western powers were “willing to wait; they were not prepared to run 
significant risks on behalf of reunification” (Kissinger  1979: 411).

Yet,  as  noted  earlier,  ‘waiting’  was  not  the  vision  energizing  Ostpolitik  and  the 
dissonance  generated  anxiety  in  Washington.  On  his  first visit to  Western  Europe  after 
becoming President in  1969, Nixon expressed scepticism about the popularity of detente 
he  encountered,  concerned  that  the  European  commitment  for  peace  was  “played  on” 
cleverly  by  Moscow.  To  keep  Europeans  from  slipping  away,  he  concluded  that  “we 
could  best  hold  the  Alliance  together  by  accepting  the  principle  of  detente  but 
establishing  clear  criteria  to  determine  its  course”  (Kissinger  1979:  403).  Behind  this 
assessment lurked the spectre of Rapallo and the discomfort with Brandt’s Ostpolitik.

Kissinger’s  assessment  was  that  Ostpolitik  was  “not  without  dangers”.  The  State 
Department in October  1969 suggested that under the new Brandt government “an active 
all-German and  Eastern policy will have the first priority” but also that Bonn “could not 
pursue  simultaneously  active  policies  towards  East  Germany  and  integration  of  the 
Federal  Republic into Western Europe” (Kissinger  1979:  408). The  implication was that 
Bonn’s  Ostpolitik  was  conducted  at  the  expense  of  ‘Western  European’  integration. 
Although Kissinger did not assume that Brandt wanted to ‘defect’ from the West, he saw 
this  as  a possible  unintended  consequence  of Ostpolitik.  In  a  memo to  Nixon  he  noted 
“there can be no doubt about their [the Brandt government’s] basic Western orientation. 
But  their  problem  is  to  control  a  process  which...may  shake  Germany’s  domestic

381  How  Kissinger  felt  about the  country  of his  birth  and  how  his  personal  experiences  of the 
Third  Reich 
impacted  his  thinking  about  Germany-in-Europe  is  an 
important  question. 
Unfortunately, I am not aware of a study addressing it in a substantial way.

stability  and  unhinge  its  international  position”  (Ibid.,  408f.).  Kissinger’s  scepticism 
echoed  Adenauer’s reasoning  in  suggesting that Brandt’s course  could turn  into “a new 
form  of classic  German  nationalism”  and  that  “from  Bismarck  to  Rapallo  it  was  the 
essence  of Germany’s  nationalist  foreign  policy to  manoeuvre  freely  between  East  and 
West”.  Only  through  NATO  and  the  European  Community  the  FRG  had  become 
grounded firmly in the West (Kissinger  1979: 409).

Uncertainty  over  whether  the  unfolding  ‘Germany’  would  remain  in  ‘the  West’ 
concerned  the  Nixon  administration,382  and  its  discomfort  with  Brandt-Germany  was 
reflected  in  how  the  personalities,  Brandt  and  Bahr,  were  evaluated.  From  Kissinger’s 
memoirs it  is clear that among Western  European  leaders,  Brandt was  liked the  least by 
Nixon.  While  the  president  admired  de  Gaulle  and  hoped  to  establish  a  special 
relationship with Heath, neither he nor Kissinger spoke favourably of the Chancellor.  In 
private,  Nixon  expressed  outright  dislike  of the  ‘socialist’  and  worse  (see  Merseburger 
2002:  626).  Kissinger  also  had  little  sympathy  for  Bahr,  his  ‘back  channel’  contact. 
After the  latter’s  first  visit  in  Washington  in  1968,  Kissinger concluded  that  Bahr  was 
not  committed  to  the  German-American  friendship:  “a  man  of the  left...above  all  a 
German  nationalist  who  wanted  to  exploit  Germany’s  central  position  to  bargain  with 
both  sides”,  who “believed that Germany could only realize  its  national destiny only by 
friendship  with  the  East”  and  who  “was  obviously  not  as  unquestionably  dedicated  to 
Western unity as the people we had known  in the previous government; he was also free 
of  any  sentimental  attachment  to  the  United  States”  (Kissinger  1979:  41 Of).  These 
meetings were hence not characterized by an intimate connection and were not a creative 
source for world building. After their first meeting, Kissinger complained about “single- 
mindedness” of Brandt and Bahr “asking not for our advice but for our cooperation  in a 
course  to  which  its  principal  figures  had  long  since  been  committed” (Kissinger  1979: 
41 If.).

latent 
Instead  of  voicing  this  concern  openly,  Kissinger  decided  “to  mute  the 
incompatibility  between  Germany’s  national  aims  and  its  Atlantic  and  European  ties” 
and  to  channel  Brandt’s  policy  “in  a  constructive  direction”  (Kissinger  1979:  410).  A 
‘constructive  direction’  meant  supporting  Ostpolitik  where  it  fit  the  US  agenda  of

382  Considering  German  public  opinion’s  desire  for  ‘equidistance’,  the  US  had  reasons  for 
questioning  the  FRG’s  ‘Western’  commitment.  In  a  poll  from  May  1973  the  majority  (54%) 
thought  Bonn  should  pursue  a  strategy  of  equal  cooperation  with  Washington  and  Moscow, 
whereas  36% preferred closer cooperation  with  the  former and  3% with  the  latter.  See  Clemens 
. (1992:  43,  51).  Kissinger’s concerns were  not  limited to  Germany.  He  also  feared a communist 
takeover in Italy: “These trends seemed obvious to me” (Kissinger  1979: 920fi).

stabilising  Europe  and  where  it  offered  a  lever  in  negotiations  with  Moscow,  and 
remaining passive,  at best,  where  Bonn’s course  risked  undermining Kissinger’s world. 
The  overall  aim  was  not  to  allow  Brandt  to  redefine  the  Western  project,  while  at  the 
same time not letting him become frustrated with the US and loosen ties. To keep Brandt 
close,  Nixon  took  up  his  request  for  regular  ‘consultations’  -   Brandt  recalls  an 
“unprecedented”  close  contact  between  the  Chancellery  and  the  White  House  -   and 
sought  to  make  sure  all  major  Ostpolitik  initiatives  went  through  NATO,  without 
energizing  them.383  Hence,  when  in  a  meeting  with  Nixon  in  December  1971  Brandt 
expressed  his  gratification  for NATO’s  support for  Ostpolitik “Nixon  frostily corrected 
him, saying the Alliance did not object to the policy” (Kissinger  1979:  966, emphasis in 
original).

Brandt: Discomfort with Nixon/Kissinger America
The  Brandt government was  aware that  its  ambitions to  introduce  fundamental  changes 
into  the  design  of Europe  were  not  shared  in  Washington.  Although  the  White  House 
never openly  expressed  doubts  about  Ostpolitik or European  unity towards  him,  Brandt 
noted  the  “ambivalence”  and  scepticism  he  encountered  in  meetings  and  registered 
unwillingness to engage in a constructive discussion about European order.384 Moreover, 
open critique to his course from the old US foreign policy establishment, in particular its 
‘Europeanists’.  Encouraged  by  an  active  CDU/CSU 
to  mobilise 
Washington  against  Ostpolitik,  figures  like  Clay,  Ball,  McCloy  and  Acheson  variably 
accusing Brandt of weakening the FRG’s  commitment to NATO and to the  EC (Brandt 
1976:386).

trying 

lobby 

The  Chancellor  worked  hard  to  counter  this  impression  and  dispel  American  doubts 
about his government’s commitment to the Western  project,  repeatedly assuring that his 
Ostpolitik  was  a  German  contribution  to  detente.385  On  every  possible  occasion  he 
emphasized to American audiences the importance of the FRG’s partnership with the US

383 Symbolic was the meeting in December  1971  where Nixon assured Brandt that despite the US 
focus  on  the  Soviet  Union  and  China  “Europe  is  the  most  important,  and  the  key  to  Europe  is 
Germany  (...)  The  future  of  Germany  and  its  position  in  the  Alliance  always  stands  in  the 
foreground  of  American  considerations.  Maintaining  the  strength  of  the  Alliance...[is]  the 
precondition for the efforts to detente” (in Brandt 1976: 397f.).
384  In  his  memoirs,  Brandt recalls  a confusing conversation  with Nixon  over US  support for his 
negotiations  on  the  ‘Eastern  Treaties’.  He  even  prints  an  transcript  extract  to  demonstrate  his 
difficulties  in  understanding  Nixon’s  position  when  he  said  things  like  “the  USA  will  respect 
[Bonn’s] decision with benign neutrality” (in Brandt 1976: 401).
385 To  the American  Council  on  Germany  in New York he presented his policies  as  “the  logical 
complement and extension” of what NATO allies were doing (Brandt  1976: 394fi).

251

and  assured  that  his  government  was  not  going  ‘off course’.386  He  buttressed  this  by 
arguing  that  in  his  understanding  the  German  and  American  biographies  remained 
intimately  linked.  In  a  dinner  speech  at  the  White  House  he  stressed  the  German 
commitment to the  values  of liberty/freedom,  democracy and  self determination  which 
“corresponds  not only our experience  but also  determine  our spiritual  position  in  world 
politics”  (Brandt  1976:  381).  At the National  Press  Club  in  Washington  in  April  1970, 
Brandt  praised  the  American  support  in  rebuilding  Germany  after  the  war  as  a  high 
moral  accomplishment  and  the  ‘rescue  of  Berlin’  in  1948/49  as  unforgettable  (ibid., 
384f).  Yet  he  also  noted  that  overcoming  the  frozen  European  fronts  and  working 
towards  peaceful  coexistence  in  Europe would  require  leaving behind  outdated theories 
and  making an effort towards “a new synthesis of reality and  ideals” (ibid.,  385).  In the 
same  vein,  in  a  speech  in  Yale  in  1971  he  called  for  the  “willingness  and  ability  for 
permanent reform” (ibid., 387).

In this aspect Brandt had great difficulties to see in the Nixon administration the desired 
partner for building a shared European order. To him “the role of the United States in the 
world...had  undergone  substantial  [wesentlich]  change  since  the  time  of  Kennedy” 
(Brandt  1976:  379),  with  ‘wesentlich’  describing  a  change  that  cannot  be  captured  in 
measurable  quantities  but  points  to  a  change  in  a  state  of authentic  being.  That  Brandt 
was thinking in these terms becomes clear when noting that he took ‘Kennedy America’ 
as a point of comparison against which  ‘Nixon America’  appeared as a power in decline 
with  a  conservative  president  who  seemed  insecure  and  never  really  seemed  at  ease 
(Ibid.,  375).  In  particular  when  it  came  to  discuss  ‘Europe’  he  encountered  a  US 
administration whose  position  ranged  from  being vague and  indifferent to the  confused 
and defensive.

Brandt  recognized  the  importance  of Kissinger  in  shaping  the  American  conception  of 
the  world  and  regarded  the  basic  principles  of  this  outlook  as  problematic.  For  the 
Chancellor, the world  at the  end  of the 20th  century  could  “never match the  ‘concert of 
the  powers’,  which  had  determined  politics  and  diplomacy  of the  19th  century”  (Brandt 
1976:  376f).  He  sensed  that  with  this  frame  in  place  Kissinger’s  willingness to  engage 
the  European  project did  not  go far.  According to  Hanrieder,  the  Chancellor was  “fully 
aware” 
that  Washington  pursued  an  “essentially  conservative”  European  policy 
(Hanrieder,  1989:  98). Herbert Blankenhom, the FRG’s ambassador in London, assessed

386 This also motivated Brandt’s strategy to remain silent over the issue of Vietnam noted earlier.

252

in  1969  that  “the  American  government...does  not  want  to  touch  upon  the  European 
status quo at this point” (ibid.).

Thus, when  it came to the issue of European order, Brandt complained that Kissinger did 
not  show  sufficient  understanding  and  was  unwilling,  even  unable  to  be  a  creative 
partner.  In  his  memoirs  he  recalls  that  “the  word  Europe...also  hints  at  the  shadows 
which occasionally touched my relations with Kissinger. I could not fight the impression 
that  he  did  not  want  to  fully  acknowledge  the  reality  of the  slowly  and  laboriously 
[muhselig]  growing European Community -  as  if it was particularly difficult for him to 
understand the changing Heimat of his parents  and forefathers”  (Brandt  1976:  377).  He 
goes on describing his American colleague in rather unflattering terms when noting how 
Kissinger often reacted  impatiently and that “perhaps...he [Kissinger] was overburdened 
not only  physically  but  psychologically”  (Ibid.,  377).  Brandt’s  disappointment with the 
lack  of  fruitful  interaction  is  also  noted  in  his  observation  that  Kissinger  seemingly 
wanted to take East-West questions in his own hand and considered himself in a position 
from  which  he  could  see  better:  “He  sometimes  seemed  to  look  (down)  at  the  old 
continent  with  the  contempt  of the  new  Roman  for  the  Hellenic  small  states”  (Brandt 
1976:  377ff).

NATO or CSCE? Tensions Towards Helsinki
Recognising that NATO was not the institutional frame through which  ‘Germany’ could 
unfold  into  a  Greater  European  Peace  Order,  the  proposal  for  a  European  Security 
Conference 
(ESC)  gained  momentum  in  Bonn.  The  ‘Budapest  Appeal’  from  March 
1969  renewed the  proposal  for a ESC  and dropped the demand that NATO would  have 
to  be  dissolved.  The  same  month,  Brandt  made  a  positive  remark  about  such  a 
conference  in  the  Bundestag,  and  in  April  he  suggested  to  Nixon  and  Kissinger  to 
engage the proposal to make further progress on the way to  ‘peace’  by linking it to talks 
on  force  reductions  (Brandt  1976:  248f.).  NATO  foreign  ministers  offered  to  look  into 
how  a  useful  process  of negotiation  could  be  initiated,  insisting that  US  and  Canadian 
participation would be necessary in a conference of this kind, which was accepted by the 
Warsaw Pact in June  1970. After some back and forth establishing the conditions under 
which the  conference  would  take  place,  concerning  in  particular the  demand  by  Brandt 
that the  status  of Berlin  and  the  relationship  between  FRG  and  GDR had to be clarified 
prior  to  the  conference,  talks  on  what  now  was  called  a  Conference  on  Security  and

253

Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  were  opened  in  Helsinki  in  July  1973.387  This  was 
followed  by  working  level  negotiations  in  Geneva  from  September  1973  to  July  1975 
and concluded with a meeting of heads of states in Helsinki on  1  August  1975.

As  John  Maresca  recalls,  it  was  clear  to  participants  that  at  core  of  the  CSCE 
negotiations was the question  of Germany in  Europe:  “although  it was never mentioned 
publicly...all  of the  delegates  at  the  Conference  realised  that  the  CSCE  was,  in  fact, 
about Germany, and that it would bear importantly on the status of that divided nation in 
the  future”  (Maresca  1984:  81).388  In  light  of  the  dissonance  of  how  to  envision 
Germany-in-Europe,  American  and  German  approaches  to  the  negotiations  differed 
significantly.

those  Adenauer  had  used 

For Brandt the idea of a pan-European security conference was not a  ‘Soviet’  idea.  Even 
though the first concrete proposal had come from Moscow, the idea of such a conference 
and  the  notion  of  ‘collective  security’ 
it  promised  had  circulated  among  Social 
Democrats  since the  1950s.  This  allowed  Brandt to  adopt and  substantiate the  proposal 
with his own  ideas of order, appropriating it for his project of a ‘Greater Europe’. Given 
Moscow’s eagerness to engage the conference,  it also enabled the Brandt government to 
practice  ‘linkage’  politics  similar  to 
towards  NATO 
membership.389  As  noted  earlier,  Brandt  had  accepted  that  negotiations  about  change 
required the quasi-recognition of the GDR, but the aim was to tie the latter to the former. 
The  conference  offered  a  lever for  bilateral  negotiations  concerning the  status  of Berlin 
and  of the  FRG-GDR  relationship,  as  otherwise  participation  of both  FRG  and  GDR 
would  de facto  legitimise  the  latter  as  a  state  equal  to  the  FRG  (Brandt,  1976:  248; 
Tessmer 2004:  58).  Yet the conference was far more than  a  lever.  The  ‘Eastern treaties’ 
and the Helsinki Final Act were interwoven, part of a two-step strategy.390 When Brandt 
noted  in  March  1973  that the time had  come where the  bilateral  elements of Ostpolitik 
were  to  be  replaced  by  multilateral  ones  (in  Roloff  1995:  83),  he  saw  CSCE  as  the 
necessary forum  through which the  development of a Greater European  order could  be

387  In  May  1970  a  NATO  communique  laid  out  (Bonn’s)  precondition  that  the  bilateral 
negotiations  between  the  FRG  and  the  Soviet  Union,  Poland  and  the  GDR  would  have  to  be 
completed  beforehand.  After  the  Germany-Soviet  treaty  was  signed  in August  1970  and  the 
Germany-Poland  treaty  in December  that  year,  Bonn  insisted  on  a  four  power  agreement  on 
Berlin  before starting preparatory talks for a  ‘European’  conference.  Moscow,  in turn,  asked  for 
the  bilateral  treaties  to  be  ratified  in  the  Bundestag before  singing the  Berlin  agreement.  When 
the  FRG  and  the  GDR  agreed  on  a  ‘basic  treaty’  establishing  mutual  recognition  in  December 
1972, the way to CSCE was opened.
388 While many saw the Helsinki  document as a de facto peace treaty thirty years after the end of 
the Second World War, Germany sought to prevent this, which is why it was called ‘Final Act’.

pursued  and  in  which  a  change  of  the  narrative  of  Germany-in-Europe  could  be 
embedded,  Domestically,  this  move  produced  a  heated  debate  over  its  impact  on  the 
Western  project.  Brandt  and  Scheel  were  accused  by the  CDU/CSU  of abandoning  he 
Hallstein Doctrine/recognising the GDR and of weakening the FRG’s ties with the West, 
indeed  of  pursuing  a  course  of  ‘changing  camps’.391  The  government  countered  that 
Ostpolitik was  the  German  contribution  to  the  Western  detente  effort  operating  firmly 
within  the  frame  formulated  in  the  Harmel  Report  and  intended  to  strengthening  the 
West (Knapp  1974:  169f.).

The Nixon  administration  was not at all  enthusiastic about the  prospect of a conference 
which could only  introduce uncertainty  into  European order.  Rather than  seeing  it as an 
opportunity to  recreate  the  Western  project, Nixon  considered  the  conference  “a  Soviet 
project”  (Maresca,  1984:  42).  In  his  eyes  Moscow  was  seducing  Western  Europeans 
with  a false promise for peace  by being extraordinarily persevering  in  proposing such  a 
conference  over and over again  which  “like  drops  of water on  a stone... sooner or  later 
erode  the  resistance  of restless  democracies”  (Kissinger  1979:  413).  Hence,  once  the 
talks  got underway the Nixon  administration  exercised  a  Tow  profile’  approach.  When 
in  early  1971  Brandt again brought up the topic  in  Washington  he found  his discussion 
partners  “surprisingly  indifferent”  (Brandt  1976:  386),  an  attitude  which  according  to 
Brandt did not change (Ibid., 391 ).392 This attitude o f ‘indifference’  is confirmed by John 
Maresca,  the  senior  American  diplomat  participating  in  the  negotiations  process,  who 
recalls  that  the  administration  showed  a  “desire  to  deliberately  downgrade  (its) 
significance” (Maersca  1984:  64). The US  delegation was not provided with  specific or, 
indeed,  any written  instructions and throughout the conference used three different chief 
negotiators with little experience (Ibid., 44flf.). At the same time, Washington pressed for 
an early conclusion of the negotiations, with Kissinger at one point calling for an end of 
the  “theological  debate”  in  Geneva  (Ibid.,  65f).  Kissinger  also  publicly  ridiculed  the 
number of Western  proposals tabled  and  fostered the view  in  the  American  public  that 
the CSCE was “a somewhat silly haggle among diplomats” (Ibid., 68).

The American  Tow profile’  approach  is  sometimes explained with  Washington’s desire 
not  to  disturb  its  negotiations  with  Moscow  over  MBFR  and  the  preoccupation  with

391  The  CDU/CSU  rejected  the  Helsinki  Final  Act.  On  the  CDU/CSU  position  to  Brandt’s 
Ostpolitik more generally, see Clemens (1989).
392  The  ESC  receives  very  sparse  attention  in  Kissinger’s  accounts  of  his  time  in  the  White 
House:  three  out  of  almost  1500  pages,  which  mainly  note  its  ‘irrelevance’.  Similarly, 
Lundestad’s  (1998)  appraised  account  of the  US  policy  towards  European  integration  does  not 
mention the CSCE.

finding an  ‘honourable’ way out of Vietnam (Kissinger  1979:  1249f;  Maresca  1984:  45). 
Yet the theoretical  lens used here suggests that Washington toned  down  its involvement 
not  because  it  considered  the  CSCE  process  irrelevant  but  because  it  unsettled  the 
American  understanding  of European  order  and,  hence,  the  Western  project.  With  the 
fears  of  a  ‘selective’  detente  and  Rapallo 
the  position  of  the  Nixon 
administration  was  indifferent  only  at  the  surface.  Given  its  potential  to  change  the 
status  quo  in  Europe,  the  display of indifference  masked  a  feeling of uneasiness.  Thus, 
when  Brandt  complained  that  the  Nixon  administration  did  not  “clearly  enough 
[recognize]  the  great  opportunity  which  could  arise  out  of this  novel...connection  to 
Europe” (Brandt  1976:  386f.),  he failed to notice that it did care.  As Kissinger writes  in 
his  memoirs,  directly  referring  to  Brandt’s  assessment:  “He  was  wrong.  We  got  the 
point.  We  simply  were  not  persuaded  by  the  argument  and  we  thought  it  to  be  more 
tactful  not  to  pursue  it”  (Kissinger  1979:  424).  What  to  Brandt  looked  like  an 
opportunity  to  create  something  new,  for  Kissinger  it  brought  an  uncertainty  into  the 
Western space he did not like.

The ‘Year of Europe’
Kissinger  tried  to  counter  the  growing  popularity  of the  ESC  idea  with  initiatives  to 
revitalize the Western project through NATO.  Yet given the  lack of a shared vision of a 
future  European  space, these attempts only exposed the  dissonance  over ideas  of order. 
Two  initiatives exemplify this.  As soon as entering the White House  in  1969,  Kissinger 
had  tried  to  revitalize  NATO  as  the  primary  institution  for  shared  world  building  in 
Europe.  In April  he  emphasized  in  a memo to Nixon  the need  for “consultations within 
NATO  designed  to  develop  coherent  western  positions”  (Kissinger  1979:  415)  and 
proposed a  ‘Committee on the Challenges of Modem  Society’  within NATO,  as well as 
suggestions for a more frequent mid-level meetings. Nixon put these ideas forward in his 
speech on the twentieth anniversary of the Alliance in April  1969 (Ibid., 386).  Kissinger 
complained that this  proposal  only  received  a “lukewarm  reception”  from  Bonn,  which 
he took as  proof that German/European  calls  for rethinking the  purpose  of the  Alliance 
were  not  serious  and  that  demands  for  more  consultations  were  only  meant  “to  limit 
America’s freedom of action” (Ibid., 387). Yet Kissinger had failed to accommodate that 
Brandt  was  not  asking  for  working-level  meetings  and  talks  about  environmental 
protection  and 
improving  transportation  but  was  looking  for  top-level  exchanges 
working towards the peaceful transforming of Greater Europe.

Similarly  ill  conceived,  yet  more  revealing,  was  Kissinger’s  proposal  for  a  ‘New 
Atlantic Charter’  from April  1973  (Kissinger  1973),  which  can  be  seen as a response to

256

the EC’s communique from  October  1972  calling for a  ‘constructive dialogue’  with the 
US.  In this proposal, Kissinger called for making  1973 the  ‘Year of Europe’. Noting that 
“the  problems  in  the  Atlantic  relationship  are  real”  Kissinger  rightly  identified  the 
challenge  as  whether  its  unity  can  be  restored  by  drawing  “new  purpose  from  shared 
positive aspirations”  (Kissinger  1973:  188f.).  Indeed,  he went as  far as  saying that “the 
Atlantic nations must join in a fresh act of creation, equal to that undertaken by the post­
war  generation  of  leaders  in  Europe  and  America”.  For  this  purpose  Nixon  would 
“embark on a personal and direct approach to the  leaders of Western Europe (...) to  lay 
the basis  for a new era of creativity in the West” and to reinvigorate “shared  ideals  and 
common purpose with our friends” (Ibid.,  189).

Apart  from  complaining  about  rising  economic  competition  and  lacking  reciprocity  in 
defence spending, Kissinger identified two key problems.  First, his note that the US  had 
global  interests  and  responsibilities  whereas  Europeans  had  regional  ones  and  his 
suggestion  to  include  Japan  in  the  common  project,  point  to  the  difference  between 
American  and  European  spatial  horizons  in  their  world  building  ambitions.  Second, 
Kissinger’s remark that “some of our friends  in Europe seemed “unwilling to accord the 
United  States the  same trust  in  our motives as they  received  from  us”  (Kissinger  1973: 
191)  pointed  to  a  divergence  of  horizons  of  expectations.  However,  while  Kissinger 
recognised  these  fundamental  problems  and  called  for “a  shared  view of the  world  we 
seek to build”, the initiative was,  in the eyes of one close observer, “a failure” because it 
“created  more  discord  than  it  alleviated”  (Kohl  1975:  18).  It was  perceived  not  as  an 
invitation for building a shared world but for contributing to Kissinger’s world.

It was not only that the speech was crafted and  delivered without any prior notification, 
let  alone  consultation  of  NATO  allies,  leaving  them  surprised  and  suspicious  of 
American  intent (Ibid.). The key problem was that Kissinger, while paying lip service to 
the  continuous  US  support  for  “the  unification  of  Europe”  (Kissinger  1973:  190), 
depicted a united  Europe primarily as an  economic rival.  From the German perspective, 
in particular, Kissinger’s  ‘New Atlantic Charter’  lacked a sense of the  European project 
as  one  of transformation.  Brandt,  in  a  response  to  Kissinger’s  speech  in  the  New  York 
Times, stressed that the European project was growing beyond economic integration and 
that  “the  major  task  of  all  Europeans  [is]  reuniting  our  divided  continent”.  Indeed, 
whereas  Kissinger  did  not  specify  the  shared  project  Brandt  noted  that  Ostpolitik  has 
released  “energies  for  the  construction  of  a  common  Europe”  (Brandt  1973:  193). 
Notable  in  this  response  is  that  it  maintains  that  this  development  is  anchored  in 
Jefferson’s  ‘pursuit  of  happiness’  principle,  while  at  the  same  time  calling  it  an

257

‘emancipated  partnership’  built  on  a “new  self-awareness  of Europe”  and  a “consensus 
of  opinion  within  the  European  Community...formed  around  the  nucleus  of  Franco- 
German solidarity” (Brandt  1973:  194f.).

With this  last point Brandt also refers to the support the CSCE conference received from 
other  Western  European  governments.  When  the  US  took  a  low  profile  stand  Brandt 
successfully  moved  to  the  EC  as  the  primary  forum  for  coordination  and  consultation 
among  Western  Europeans.  The  Luxembourg  Report  from  October  1970  was  an 
important stepping stone  in establishing the EC’s new ‘European  Political  Cooperation’ 
(EPC) mechanism and for forming the EC subcommittee in the CSCE process which, as 
analysts  have  pointed  out,  was  quite  successful 
in  devising  joint  positions  and 
influencing  the  negotiations  (Smith  2004:  69-89;  Maresca  1984:  19;  Spohr  Readman 
2006:  1101).  While  Western  Europeans,  in  particular France,  may have opted  for close 
consultations  in the EC  in part because they wanted to keep a close watch on Germany, 
the  EC  caucus  was  an  effective  forum  in  the  negotiations  because  its  members  could 
agree on the  purpose of the conference as  instilling opportunities for changing Europe’s 
order (Maresca  1984: 43).

Conclusion
This  chapter  sought to  explain  the  tensions  entering  German-American  relations  in  the 
decade  leading  up to  the  Helsinki  Final  Act.  Framed  as  a  process  of estrangement,  the 
objective was  to  assess  why  and  in  what way  political  leaders  in  Germany  and  the  US 
came  to  disagree  about  the  relative  value  of NATO  and  CSCE  as  the  most  suitable 
institution through which their respective understanding of ‘Germany’  and  ‘America’  in 
the  world  could  unfold.  The  discussion  traced  this  disagreement  to  dissonance  over 
visions of an order of Europe at peace.

The  discussion  laid  out  Brandt’s  vision  of  ‘Germany’  becoming  unified  in  a  Greater 
European Peace Order, which motivated his policy of overcoming the order of Yalta and 
rendered  Ostpolitik  a  kind  of  Europapolitik.  While  it  was  argued  that  Brandt’s 
transformative vision  of Germany-in-Greater-Europe  was  developed  in  interaction  with 
‘Kennedy  America’,  his  relationship  with  the  Nixon/Kissinger  administration, 
in 
particular, was not marked by creativity but by dissonance over the meaning o f ‘peace in 
Europe’.  It  was  shown  that  in  contrast  to  Brandt’s  transformative  vision,  from 
Washington  ‘peace  in Europe’  meant stability of the order of Yalta and that Kissinger’s 
conception  of  ‘Europe’  was  not  only  static  but  also  ambiguous  about  the  value  of

258

European  ‘unity’  for  the  Western  project,  rendering  him  unable  to  solve  the  tension 
between envisioning an independent yet ‘close’ Europe.

The  chapter  showed  that  German-American  dissonance  found  expression  in  mutual 
suspicion  about  commitment  to  the  Western  project.  In  an  attempt  to  maintain  the 
friendship,  it  was  mediated  by  silence  on  contentious  issues,  such  Vietnam,  and  by 
hiding  diverging  paths  under  a  shared  commitment  for  ‘detente’  as  formulated  in 
NATO’s Harmel Report. The chapter suggested that despite Nixon/Kissinger’s efforts to 
curtail  Ostpolitik  through  NATO  and  revitalize  the  Atlantic  frame,  Brandt  considered 
NATO  insufficient for Germany’s authentic becoming in a  ‘Greater Europe’  and sought 
investment  in  CSCE.  It  interpreted  the  Nixon  administration’s  reluctant  support  of the 
conference and attempt to decrease  its  importance through a show of ‘indifference’  was 
as  a strategy to  keep  Brandt committed to  the  Western  project yet reduce  his  ability to 
bring uncertainty into European order.

CHAPTER TEN: CFSP / GERMAN-US DIVERGENCE (1985-1995)

Introduction
The  previous  chapter  explained  German-American  tensions  over  investment  in  CSCE, 
specifically Bonn’s pro-active stance and Washington’s reluctance, with dissonance over 
the  meaning  of  ‘peace  in  Europe’  signifying  a  process  of estrangement.  This  chapter 
addresses  the  divergence  in  German-American  security  cooperation  in  the  decade 
surrounding  the  end  of the  Cold  War,  specifically  Bonn’s  investment  in  CFSP  as  an 
alternative to NATO  and  CSCE.  The  theoretical  lens  applied  here  suggests that  during 
this  period  one  can  witness  an  enduring  dissonance  between  German  and  American 
narratives of being-in-the-world prompting the Kohl  government to pursue a strategy of 
emancipation.  Corroborating this  argument  is  not  an  easy  task  as  it  runs  counter three 
conventional  wisdoms.  First,  Kohl  is  known  for  his  pro-American  attitude  and  the 
Germany/Europe-friendly  reputation  of the  three  US  administrations,  lead  by  Ronald 
Reagan,  George  Bush  and  Bill  Clinton,  increased  from  the  first  to  the  last.  Second, 
German  unification  is  generally  considered  an  example  of  close  and  harmonious 
German-American  cooperation  rather  than  part  of  an  estrangement/emancipation 
process.  Finally,  NATO’s engagement  in  Bosnia  in  1995  is  generally  seen  as  affirming 
its relevance and symbolising the failure of CFSP. This chapter does not repudiate these 
points,  but  it  suggests  that  if  looked  at  carefully  they  did  not  halt  the  process  of 
estrangement but were either hiding or even fuelling it.

The  discussion  proceeds  in  three  parts.  The  first  part  lays  out  the  orientation  of the 
Kohl/Genscher  government  as  a  merger  of  Adenauer’s  and  Brandt’s  narrative  of 
‘Germany-in-Europe’  and  points  out 
the  Reagan 
administration.  The  second  part  outlines  the  close  cooperation  between  Bonn  and 
Washington during the negotiations  leading to German unification to  suggest that  it  left 
untouched the  dissonance over the vision of European  order.  The third  part shows  how 
dissonance  resurfaced  in  the  evaluation  of the  meaning  of the  1991  Gulf War  and  the 
conflict  in  Bosnia for the  ‘Western’  project,  discussing German  resistance to  building a 
‘New World Order’ with military force and lacking American commitment to invest in a 
‘European  Peace  Order’.  The  discussion  concludes  with  arguing that to compensate the 
estrangement  process  with  Washington,  Bonn 
throughout  pursued  a  strategy  of 
emancipation by cooperating with France to invest in CFSP.

Merging Adenauer and Brandt
Brandt’s  successor  Helmut  Schmidt  (SPD),  Chancellor  from  1974  to  1982,  did  not 
formulate  a  new/original  vision  of  Germany-in-Europe  to  the  extent  Adenauer  and 
Brandt  did  but  self-confidently  steered  the  FRG  on  a  path  balancing  Ostpolitik  and 
Westintegration.  Schmidt  is  often  described  as  a  manager who,  after having completed 
the  CSCE  talks  in  Helsinki,  pursued  a  strategy  of  “consolidation”  of  Ostpolitik 
(Hanrieder  1989:  209f.) while focusing on making the FRG “the second world power in 
the  West”  (in  Niedhart  2004:  51).  As  such,  he  placed  less  emphasis  on  the  vision  of a 
‘Greater  Europe’  and  more  on  strengthening  the  FRG’s  position  in  the  Western  space. 
While  developing  strong  bonds  with  France  and  considering  the  EC  a  valuable 
institution for deepening the Western European integration,  Schmidt regarded friendship 
with the US  a “clear priority” (in Banchoff 1999:  111).  Thus, although Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich  Genscher  worked  hard  to  keep  the  CSCE  process  alive  (see  below), 
Schmidt moved the government’s emphasis back to NATO. But his relationship with the 
Carter  administration  was  tense  and  produced  few  impulses  for  common  creative 
endeavours,  and  his  famous  ‘double-track decision’  was  controversial  domestically and 
played a key role in his political downfall in  1982.393

Since  1982 the government was formed by a coalition between Christian Democrats and 
Liberal  Democrats,  headed  by Chancellor Helmut Kohl  (CDU) and,  until  1992,  Foreign 
Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher (FDP).  Despite the fact that the FDP was only a minor 
coalition  partner,  Genscher  exerted  considerable  influence  on  the  government’s  path. 
Even more so than  Schmidt the narrative of Germany-in-Europe it pursued was a merger 
of the orientations of Adenauer and  Brandt, that is, a bifurcation of Westintegration and 
Ostpolitik.

As  part of the Flakhelfer generation  which  had  experienced the war as teenagers,  Kohl 
and  Genscher  shared  the  anti-war  sentiment  characterizing  the  narrative  of  post-45 
Germany.  They  also  shared  the  sense  that  the  FRG’s  prosperity  was  owed  largely  to 
having adhered to Western  ideals. Thus, they were both committed to continue building 
Germany  in  a  peaceful  European  space  valuing  ‘freedom’  and  ‘unity’.  Beyond  that,

393  The  anti-American  sentiment  expressed  by  domestic  critics  of  Schmidt’s  ‘double-track’ 
decision  did  not translate  to  dissonance  amongst the political  leadership,  or to  a  German  move 
away  from  NATO.  Schmidt’s  decision  against  domestic  opposition  was  motivated  in  part  to 
ensure that the  West  remained  ‘strong’  and Germany  a  ‘reliable  ally’.  Underlying was  Schmidt 
view  that peace  in  Europe,  a process  aimed  at overcoming  division,  could  only  succeed  from  a 
position  of  strength/military  balance.  The  domestic  peace-movement,  by  contrast,  upheld  a 
stricter  interpretation  of the  pacifist  principle  and  called  for  ‘making  peace  without  weapons’ 
[Frieden schaffen ohne Waffen]. See Mueller and Risse-Kappen (1987); Rupps (1997: 256ff);

Kohl  and  Genscher favoured two  slightly different visions  of Germany-in-Europe,  with 
the  former  emphasizing  the  ‘Western  Europe’  space  of  Adenauer  and  the  latter 
favouring the notion of a ‘Greater Europe’  reminiscent of Brandt.

Kohl grew up in Ludwigshafen in the Rhine region, the Palatine, and after the war joined 
the  newly  founded  CDU  in  1946.  He  gradually  climbed  up  the  ranks  of  the  party, 
becoming  minister  president  of Rhineland-Palatinate  in  1969,  federal  chairman  of the 
CDU  in  1973  and  three  years  later  leader  of  the  parliamentary  opposition  in  the 
Bundestag.  In  1982,  after Schmidt’s resignation,  Kohl  was  elected  Chancellor and  held 
this  position  until  1998.  Regarding  himself as  the  political  heir  of Adenauer,394  Kohl 
upheld  the  maxim  that  German  unity  would  be  desirable  only  within  the  ‘free  world’ 
(Kohl  1996:  2 Iff.).  His  ‘Report on  the  State  of the Nation  in  a divided  Germany’  from 
March  1984 was entitled  ‘Freedom  is the core of the German question’  and declared that 
“the  protection  of freedom  takes  priority  over  all  other  goals”.  It  claimed  “we  know 
where we belong; we know where we stand:  on the side of freedom” and that, therefore, 
Germany’s place would always be in the West (Kohl  1984; also von Weizsaecker  1986). 
Kohl’s commitment to  ‘freedom’  was combined with a strong commitment to European 
unity.  In  the  abovementioned  report  he  noted  that  “we  must  unify  Europe  to  also 
complete  the  unification  of  Germany”  and  that  the  lessons  from  the  mishandling  of 
Germany’s position at “the heart of Europe” was that “we have to and want to shape our 
future  within  a  European  framework  and  resolve  our  national  question  as  a  work  of 
peace”  (Kohl  1984:  3).395  For Kohl,  the  creation  of a  united  Europe  was  in  Germany’s 
“existential  interest” (Bering  1999:  159; Banchoff 1999; Duffield  1998).

Kohl’s  agenda  of revitalizing  the  vision  of German  unity  was  thus  built  on  a  strong 
commitment to the space of Western Europe.  Like Adenauer,  Kohl  was a Catholic  from 
the  Rhine-region  and  liked  to  stress  his  Heimat  roots  in  the  Palatine  from  where  he 
conceived  of Europe  as  a  Christian  space.  In  his  memoirs  Kohl  describes  in  grandiose 
terms  how the  Palatine  is  intertwined  with the  history  of Heimat Europa and  manifests 
“to  be  from  the  Rhine  means  to  be  from  the  Occident”.396  Kohl  held  a  very  positive 
image  of  the  US.  He  “grew  up  in  a  CDU  that  was  wedded  to  German-American

394 Kohl even liked to refer to himself as Adenauer’s grandson (Bering  1999: 43)
395  During a visit of Thatcher,  Kohl reportedly asked one of her advisors to “convince her that I 
am not German but European”, to which Thatcher is said to have responded “My god, Helmut is 
so German!” (in Papcke  1993:  11).
396  Kohl  invokes the  cathedrals  in  Speyer and  Worms  as  places  from  which  the  German  Kaiser 
“carried the consciousness of the Occident world, this... Christian shaped cultural space”.  He calls 
Palatine the center of the Holy Roman  Empire and “a European coreland (Kernland)” and traces 
all values guiding his vision o f ‘Europe’  into this region (Bering  1999: 29; Kohl 2004: 26-29).

262

partnership” (Clemens 2001:  180; Zimmer 2001:  144f.) and according to one biographer 
believed  that  the  Americans  were  needed  “as  an  important  stabilizing  factor  for  the 
German  psyche”  (Bering  1999:  14).  The  friend  Kohl  wanted  as  a  stabilizing  partner, 
however,  was  ‘Truman  America’.  As  Clay  Clemens  notes,  Kohl’s  positive  image  of 
America  was  anchored  in  memories  of US  support  for the  ‘new  Germany’  during  the 
post-War decade. The Chancellor was an admirer of Truman who in his view had placed 
America  “at  the  heart  of  a  historic  shift  in  [Germany’s]  orientation...to  a  respected 
democracy”.  For  Kohl  the  value  of  the  German-American  relationship  was  thus 
maintained  by  a  feeling  of gratitude  which  proved  “remarkably durable...despite  what 
remained his own fairly modest level of specific knowledge (of) the US itself’ (Clemens 
2001:  179ff, Bering  1999: 45).

Genscher saw things differently.  He grew up near Halle and  initially chose to stay in the 
Soviet  occupied  zone  after  the  end  of the  war,  where  he  studied  law  and  joined  the 
newly founded German Liberal  Democratic Party. Yet this attempt to built up his  life  in 
the  Eastern  Zone  eventually conflicted  with  the  political  project pursued  by the  leaders 
of the GDR and,  by extension,  Moscow.  By  1952  he felt  ‘out of place’  in the GDR and 
concluded  it was “not my state” (Genscher  1965:  65),  deciding settle over to  Bremen  in 
the  FRG where he joined the  Free  Democratic Party (FDP).  After fighting tuberculosis, 
in  1965  Genscher became a member of the Bundestag,  serving  in  several  party offices, 
including chairman of the FDP (Genscher  1995:  55-68).  He was Minister of the Interior 
in  Brandt’s  cabinet  and  in  1974  became  Foreign  Minister  under  Schmidt  and  in  this 
position  in  the  Kohl  government  until  his  retirement  in  1992.  During  his  18  years  as 
Foreign  Minister,  Genscher  became  one  of  the  FRG’s  most  popular  politicians  and 
profoundly  shaped  the  office,  so  much  that  in  the  remaining  three  years  of the  period 
under investigation here his successor and protege Klaus Kinkel can be seen as operating 
within Genscher’s orientation.

Not  surprisingly  given  his  party  affiliation,  Genscher championed  a  liberal  order,  once 
noting  that  “freedom  is  the  breath  of progress”  (Genscher  1995:  523).  Yet  despite  the 
obvious  resonance  concerning  the  desirability  of  liberal  order,  the  connection  to  the 
American  narrative  was  not  a  deep,  emotional  one.  In  contrast  to  Kohl,  Genscher’s 
appreciation  of the  US  was  less  sentimental.  While  he  agreed  that  US  assistance  was 
instrumental  for  allowing  a  new  ‘Germany’  to  emerge,  his  personal  experiences  of the 
post-war  decade  were  not  filled  by  friendly  GI’s  and  CARE  packages  but,  as  noted 
earlier,  by trying to  build  up  his  life  in  Halle  and  finding  his  place  in  the  West.  While

263

committed  to  having  ‘Germany-in-Europe’  unfold  in  the  Western  space,  Genscher’s 
vision of a desirable European order was less  ‘Adenauer’  and more ‘Brandt’.

Genscher was not simply a ‘liberal internationalist’  but committed to the idea of a united 
Europe.  In  1981  Genscher  attempted  to  revitalize  the  vision  of  a  European  Union, 
claiming that  “(from) the  great goal  of political  unification  of Europe...we  shall  derive 
the  strength  to  act  in  a  spirit  of solidarity  and  to  take  decisions...which  are  genuinely 
forward-looking  solutions”.  Yet  other  than  Kohl,  he  was  oriented  towards  a  ‘Greater 
Europe’.  Raised as a Protestant and skeptical  about using Christian beliefs as the maxim 
for  guiding  politics,  the  notion  of  a  ‘Vatican  Europe’  did  not  resonate  with  him 
(Genscher  1995 :  55).397  Moreover,  his  roots  in  East  Germany  bestowed  him  with  a 
horizon  of experience  reaching  deeper  into  the  East than  Kohl  and,  thus,  an  emotional 
attachment to the  space  beyond the wall.398 A  critique  of Adenauer’s  course,  already  in 
1966  he  advocated  a “clear concept for the  future  development  in  Europe”  which  “has 
nothing to do with a policy of strength” (Genscher  1995:  93).  With entering the SPD-led 
government in  1969, the  Liberal  Democrats signed on to Brandt’s  Ostpolitik, adopting a 
similar vision of a Greater European Peace Order and stating in  its electoral platform the 
aim to prevent any “one-sided  dependency” of Germany.  So when  shifting to the CDU- 
led  government  in  1982,  Genscher  saw  himself  as  “the  guardian  of  the  Ostpolitik 
tradition” (Zimmer 2001:  149).

Despite these differences there was sufficient overlap between the two  leaders and their 
respective parties to allow for a workable coalition government steering the path of both 
Westintegration  and  Ostpolitik.  Kohl  did  not  consider  the  East  a  completely  Alien 
land399  and,  other  than  his  party-internal  rival  Franz-Josef  Strauss,  was  open  to  the 
FDP’s  insistence  to  continue  some  form  of  Ostpolitik,  though  preferring  the  term 
Entspannungspolitik  (Hanrieder  1989;  Banchoff  1999:  120ff.).  Theo  Sommer  noted  in 
1988  that  “there  is  no  break  in  the  continuity  of Bonn’s  Ostpolitik.  As  Brandt  laid  it 
down,  and  Schmidt played  it  in,  so  it  is  advanced  by  Kohl”  (in  Ash  1993:  33),  leading 
Ash  to  even  suggest  that  “there  was  one  ‘Ostpolitik’  of  the  Federal  Republic  of

397  However,  Genscher  agreed  with  Pope  John  Paul  II  over  the  desirability  of overcoming  the 
division  of Europe  peacefully  and  speaks of “extraordinary  cooperation”  between  Bonn  and  the 
Vatican on  issues concerning the CSCE process (Genscher 1995: 288f).
398 On Genscher’s Heimat feelings for, in particular, Halle, see Genscher (1995:66f.,  1024ff.)
399  When  opening the  German  Historical  Museum  in  Berlin  in  October  1987,  Kohl  emphasized 
that  the  opposition  between  East  and  West  could  only  be  overcome  through  a  “lasting 
overarching  European  Peace  Order”.  He  also  noted that  Berlin  was  intimately  interwoven  with 
the  German  narrative  and  that  there  was  “hardly  any  other  place  so  suitable”  for  hosting  the 
museum (Kohl  1987).

Germany”  (Ash  1993:  33).  This  was  possible  because  Genscher  was  not  calling  for  a 
social(ist)  but for a  liberal democratic  Europe  and  accepted the central  place  of the US 
in  the  German  narrative.  In  short,  they  converged  around  the  authentic  narrative  of 
Germany-in-Europe stressing familiar core values of freedom, anti-militarism and  unity. 
Recognition  as  a  ‘normal’  Western  state  thus  meant recognition  as  a  liberal  democracy 
committed to European  integration through a politics of ‘checkbook diplomacy’, a sense 
of Self which has also been called a “Civilian power” (Maull  1990;  Duffield  1998).

Dissonance with Reagan’s World
The  problem  was  that  the  intersubjective  integration  of this  narrative  in  the  Western 
project and  its  stabilization with the  United  States  as the  significant Other was  difficult 
to  pursue  with  the  Reagan  administration.  Ronald  Reagan  entered  the  White  House  in 
1982  at a time of perceived  ‘decline’  of America in  its world.  A  significant part of this 
world was the Western  space and Reagan declared it his aim to reclaim US  leadership in 
the shaping of the Western agenda.  In the imagery of one analyst, buoyed by a domestic 
constituency  which  called  for  “strength  and  toughness  in  foreign  affairs”  (Schneider 
1983: 43), Reagan aimed at moving the US from an  ‘entangled’ to a ‘defiant’  eagle (Oye 
1983;  Posen  and  Evera  1983).  This  meant  not  an  isolationist  strategy  of withdrawing 
from  the  world  but  one  of  engaging  it  more  forcefully  on  ‘American  terms’.  Like 
Adenauer  in  the  1950s,  Reagan  sought  to  strengthen  America’s  voice  in  the  West  by 
mobilizing the  enemy-image  of communism  and  buttressed  his  rhetoric  of ideological 
confrontation with a significant military buildup.  Such a strategy had  little sympathy for 
an approach  seeking gradual change through dialogue and  so the Reagan  administration 
was  “sharply  hostile  and  skeptical  of negotiations  and  remnants  of  detente”  (Kahler 
1983:  28If.).  Secretary of Defense Weinberger informed his European  counterparts that 
“if detente  is  progress,  then  let  me  say that we  cannot  afford  much  more  progress”  (in 
Lundestad  1990: 49).

Yet  as  scholars  have  pointed  out,  despite  the  moral  righteousness  with  which  Reagan 
instilled  the  aim  of restoring  US  primacy,  his  policies  were  far  less  clear  in  direction 
than  his  stark  rhetoric  suggested  (Kyvig  1990).  It  was  difficult  to  see  the  strategic 
rationale behind  Reagan’s policy of strength, that  is,  his denouncement of ‘detente’  and 
the  focus  on  military  buildup,  including  the  controversial  Strategic  Defense  Initiative 
(SDI),  in  dealing  with  the  Soviet  Union  (Posen  and  van  Evera  1983:  75ff).  Reagan’s 
vision  of  America-in-the-world  remained  blurry  in  particular  when  it  came  to  the

265

question  of European  order.400  Certainly  ‘Europe’  was  still  important,  but  it  was  less 
clear what place  it had  in the American narrative.  More  precisely,  it was not clear what 
place the idea of a united Europe had in America’s West. The rise of the EC as a serious 
economic player (‘rival’) was  seen  as  a central  factor  in  the  (felt)  decline  of US  power 
(Oye  1983:  7ff.).  And  the  dispute over the  pipeline  project  into the  Soviet Union  in the 
early  1980s  and  tacit  European  attempts  to  address  security  issues  in  an  institutional 
setting  outside  NATO  (see  below)  cast  doubt  that  a  stronger  Europe  was  a  ‘natural 
partner’  and  fed  concerns  that  Europeans  might  ‘gang  up’  against  the  US  (Lundestad 
1998:  111). Thus,  ‘Europe’ was a place where the US needed to reassert its authority.

On a more fundamental  level the Reagan administration was confronted with Kissinger’s 
ambivalence, mentioned  in the previous chapter, about the value of European integration 
for  America’s  unfolding:  if a  project  committed  to  the  idea  of a  unified  Europe  was 
actually  closing  the  space  to  American  influence  was  it  still  worth  supporting?  The 
answer  given  by  the  Reagan  White  House  was  negative.  As  Klaus  Larres  points,  out 
Reagan  was  “not  the  least  interested  in  a  supranational  Europe”  (Larres  2001:  106). 
Thus,  Reagan’s  policy  of  strength  and  what  Larres  calls  his  “arrogant  inattention” 
towards  Europe  go  together.  Rather  than  seeing  Reagan’s  ‘defiant  eagle’  approach  as 
directed  primarily  against  Moscow,  the  friendship  lens  interprets  it  a  strategy to  regain 
voice  in  the  Western  project  and  shift  it  away  from  a  European  order  of  ‘unity’. 
Reminiscent  of Adenauer’s  strategy  of rearmament  in  the  1950s,  discussed  in  chapter 
eight,  Reagan  sought  to  reassert  America’s  leadership  position  in  strategic  debates 
within NATO.

The  problem  with  Reagan’s  approach,  and  the  reason  why  one  might  see  it  as  one  of 
‘inattention’,  was  that  the  administration  was  not  merely  unsupportive  of  European 
integration  but was  indecisive as to what would make a desirable European order.  More 
precisely,  in  particular  from  the  German  perspective  the  ‘defiant  eagle’  narrative  was 
devoid  of a  vision  of a  ‘peaceful  Europe’.  Whereas  for  Nixon/Kissinger  ‘peace’  had 
meant stability of the status quo, the Reagan administration neither appeared to pursue a 
policy of stability,  nor did  its  policy of strength  seem  embedded  in  a vision  of peace  in 
Europe.  Even  after Reagan toned  down the  confrontative  rhetoric  and  shifted to portray 
itself a “party of peace” (Kahler  1983:  301; Lundestad  1990:  52), the lacking willingness 
to  engage  a  discussion  on  European  peace  order,  combined  with  a  continued  emphasis 
on  US  military  capabilities,  did  little  to  counter  the  view,  prevalent  in  the  peace

like 

‘dialogue’, 

‘conciliation’, 

Given Reagan’s discomfort with the vision of European unity  it is not surprising that he 
bonded with Britain’s Margaret Thatcher, with whom he shared the project of countering 
a  feeling  of  decline  with  bold  ‘conservative’  policies  (Krieger  1987).  However, 
Germany continued to  matter and the  Reagan  administration welcomed Kohl’s  Western 
commitment  and  his  seemingly  humble  and  decisively  pro-American  attitude.  It  was 
irritated,  however,  by  Genscher and  his  insistence on Entspannungspolitik.  As  one  not- 
so-neutral observer put it, Reagan officials considered the German Foreign Minister as a 
“royal  pain  in  the  neck”  because  he  seemed  “incapable  of uttering  a  sentence  without 
words 
‘European  security 
conference’,  or  ‘detente’  tumbling  uncontrollably  form  his  tongue”  (Bering  1999:  21). 
Behind  these  and  similarly  harsh  descriptions  of Genscher  as  an  “ambiguous  figure” 
portraying  “weakness”  (Weinberger)  and  “a  guy  who  was  very  slippery,  who  could 
change  any  time”  (Richard  Burt),  the  Reagan  administration  showed  anxiety  about 
Germany  moving  in  a  direction  which  did  not  seem  to  strengthen  the  American 
narrative.402  In  other  words,  its  frustration  with  ‘Genscherism’  echoes  Kissinger’s 
problem with  Ostpolitik (personified by Bahr) discussed  in the previous chapter, namely 
the  concern  of an  unpredictable  German  maneuvering between  East  and  West captured 
in the  ‘Rapallo complex’.

‘cooperation’, 

‘peace’, 

Kohl attempted to keep the bond  intact by denouncing domestic criticism of the US  and 
by trying to be  supporting of US  initiatives 403 Yet while a  ‘policy of strength’  approach 
resonated  with  Kohl  in  principle,  he  also  felt  uneasy  with  Reagan’s  course.  It was  not 
only the concern that a renewed confrontation between  Washington and  Moscow would 
‘freeze’  the  status  quo,  which  threatened  to  deprived  Europe  of a  “supportive  political

401  Critique  was  most  vocal  in  the  left  wing  of the  Social  Democrats,  whose  leader,  Oskar 
Lafontaine,  wrote  a  book  entitled  “Fearing  the  friends”.  On  the  debates  within  the  SPD  in  the 
1980s,  see  Ash  (1993:  Ch.  VI).  A  poll  from  May  1984  among  Germans  showed  53  per  cent 
feared that Reagan’s re-election was bad for world peace (Mueller and Risse-Kappen  1987:  60).

Gassert (2004); Morris (2004).

403  Eventually  Kohl  even responded  positively to  a US  invitation  to participate  in  SDI  research, 
against  the  protest  of Genscher,  who  threw  his  weight  behind  the  French  EUREKA  initiative 
(Sandholtz  1992:  263f).  Although  Kohl was “extremely cautious”  in  his official  remarks  on  SDI 
and did not endorse the military rationale, his government only came to support EUREKA “once 
it  became  clear that  it  was  not  an  alternative  to  SDI  but  rather parallel  to  it”  (Sandholtz  1992: 
272). For a detailed discussion, see Sandholtz (1992, Ch. 9), also Smyser (1990:  5Iff); Genscher

atmosphere”  in  which  the  unity  of  Germany-in-Europe  could  be  pursued  (Hanrieder 
1989:  213).  Even  when  Reagan  shifted  away  from  his  confrontational  stance  in  his 
second  term,  he  continued  to  discomfort the  Kohl  government with  unexpected  moves 
on  strategic  policies  affecting  European  order.  Symbolic  was  his  meeting  with 
Gorbachev  in  Reykjavik in  October  1986,  which  involved  significant discussions  about 
US  nuclear  strategy  without  any  prior  notification,  let  alone  consultation,  of NATO 
allies.  Tellingly,  not  only  were  US  officials  surprised  when  Bonn  reacted  with  serious 
discontent about being sidetracked, even more “this mutual  misunderstanding was never 
adequately  clarified”  (Smyser  1990:  59).  Thus,  ‘Reagan  America’  kept  the  ‘Potsdam 
complex’  alive 
in  complaints  about  his  policies  as  being 
contradictory  and,  hence,  unpredictable  voiced  by  moderate  and  centrist  voices 
(Genscher  1995:  528; Mueller and Risse-Kappen  1987).

in  Germany,  visible 

To reduce the uncertainty, Kohl’s approach of not criticizing Reagan was complemented 
by a campaign of stabilizing Germany’s narrative as a ‘normal’  Western European state, 
to  confirm,  as  Kohl  put  it  “the  solid  mooring  and  position  of the  Federal  Republic  of 
Germany  in  the  West”  (in  Verheyen  1999:  158).  In  this  campaign  the  notion  of 
‘normalization’  became  a  “tirelessly  repeated  formula”  (Ash  1993:  15).  Domestically, 
the  ‘normalization’  agenda  sparked  the  Historikerstreit,  a  major  controversy  among 
German historians  about the  place of the Third  Reich  in the  German  biography and  the 
weight  of  its  lessons.404  Externally,  Kohl’s  normalization  agenda  was  pursued  with 
France  and  the  US  and  received  symbolic  approval  through  joint  appearances  with 
Mitterand  at  the  military  cemetery  in  Verdun  in  1984  and  with  Reagan  to  a  German 
military  cemetery  in  Bitburg  in  1985.  It  not  only  allowed  Kohl  to  continue  an  intra- 
German “selective detente” (Hanrieder)  but also to regain  US  commitment for a  shared 
vision  of ‘unity’,  as  displayed  in  Reagan’s  Berlin  speech  from  June  1987  in  which  he 
called on Gorbachev to “tear down this wall!” (Reagan  1987).

Institutional Choices: Dealing with Dissonance
The  basis  on  which  Bonn  evaluated  security  institutions  was  captured  by  Genscher  in 
1986 when he noted that Germany was  looking for an  institution providing the frame of 
action  [.Handlungsrahmen]  which  allowed  it  to  pursue  its  “legitimate  wish  for  a 
condition  of  peace  in  Europe  within  which  in  can  regain  its  unity  in  free  self

404  At  the  core  was  an  attempt  by  some  historians  to  rehabilitate  the  Kaiserreich  as  a  positive 
memoiy space, while at the same time toning down the uniqueness of the Holocaust, not only its 
importance within  the  German  biography  (as  the  sole  focus)  but  also  as  an  event  in  general  by 
comparing it with Stalin’s Gulag (Kattago 2001; Verheyen  1999).

determination”  through  “trustworthy  and  peaceful  cooperation  with  all  its  neighbours” 
(Genscher  1995:  318).  This  was  a  diplomatic  formulation  of the  Kohl  government’s 
narrative:  the  vision  of a  unified  Germany  in  a  free  and  peaceful  Greater  Europe.  The 
security  institutions  available  were  NATO  and  CSCE.  While  Kohl’s  ‘normalization’ 
agenda 
the 
Western/European  project,  it  was  visible  in  Bonn’s  exploration  of  the  EC  as  an 
alternative security institution.

the  estrangement  with  Reagan  America  over 

largely  concealed 

In  Bonn,  NATO  remained  the  primary  institution  for  negotiating  the  Western  project. 
Kohl’s Western orientation and commitment to German-US relations made him a strong 
supporter  of  NATO,  with  one  biographer  describing  him  as  “fundamentally  a  deep 
believer  in  the  NATO  alliance”  (Bering  1999:  14).  The  sense  fostered  under  Schmidt 
that the  FRG  was  the  most  important European  member and  an  “indispensable  part”  of 
the Atlantic Alliance was maintained  even by Genscher:  “NATO relied  in the first place 
on  German  participation  and  American  engagement  in  Europe”  (Genscher  1995:  349). 
However,  in  contrast  to  the  Reagan  administration,  the  Kohl  government  read  NATO 
through the  Harmel  Report,  that  is,  as an  institution  committed to  ‘detente’.  The aim  of 
bringing  about  peaceful  unification  of  Germany-in-Europe  was  still  considered  “the 
heartpiece” of the  report,  which  Genscher called  “the  Magna Charta of the transatlantic 
policy  of responsibility”  (Genscher  1995:  466).  Given  Reagan’s  rejection  of detente, 
what was left from Bonn’s perspective was to continue Schmidt’s strategy and  influence 
in the ‘strategic’  debate on arms control,405 while de-emphasizing military instruments as 
a means  of achieving national  objectives  and  resisting US  pressure to  increase  defense 
spending (Allan and Diehl  1988). The ‘Civilian power’  narrative was reconciled with the 
Bundeswehr as  the  largest  conventional  army  in  Western  Europe  by  it  being  integrated 
into  NATO  and  with  Articles  26  and  87a  of  the  Basic  Law  restricting  its  use  for 
defensive  purposes  only,  explicitly  denouncing  the  right  to  attack,  making  the  very 
scenario  of Bundeswehr  engagement  outside  the  Western  European  space  a  “foreign 
world” (Hilz 2005: 44).

German  support  for  CSCE  was  steady,  but  here  Kohl  and  Genscher  differed  in  their 
assessments. The Christian  Democrats had of course rejected the Helsinki Final  Act and 
although  Kohl  appreciated  the  CSCE  as  a  forum  for  Entspannungspolitik  he  did  not 
consider  it the  primary forum  through which  to  build  Germany-in-Europe.  By contrast,

blocking  US  modernization  plans.  See  Banchoff (1999:  Ch.  4);  Broer  (2001);  Genscher (1995: 
Ch.  15).

269

Genscher was  enthusiastic  about CSCE’s  potential  to  pursue  a  Greater European  Peace 
Order  (1995:  100,  212-216,  299-323).  He  had  participated  in  the  final  stages  of the 
Helsinki  negotiations  and  considered  CSCE the  most suitable  negotiating  frame  for,  as 
he  put  it  diplomatically,  the  aims  formulated  in  NATO’s  Harmel  Report  (Genscher 
1995:  315).  In  1985  he  initiated  a  10-year anniversary meeting  in  Helsinki  as well  as a 
cultural  forum  in  Budapest  and  was  an  active  force  in  the  third  follow-up  meeting  in 
Vienna ffom  1986 to  ‘89.  Yet these attempts of keeping the Helsinki  process alive were 
hampered by continued disagreement with Washington over its purpose (Genscher  1995: 
229f.,  303-320).  Instead  of seeing  CSCE  as  a  forum  for  negotiating  a  transformative 
path  into  a  Greater  Europe,  US  administrations  interpreted  the  Final  Act  as  a  formal 
acknowledgment  of  the  ‘status  quo’  order  of  Yalta  and  used  it  as  a  tool  in  its 
confrontation with the Soviet Union, specifically as a vehicle to criticize Moscow for its 
record of human rights violations.406 For Genscher, the US approach  did not correspond 
with  “the  European  CSCE  philosophy”  (Genscher  1995:  312;  Lucas  2001:  71f;  Ash 
1993: 263f.).

Notable  developments  were  occurring  in  the  EC  and  the  WEU.  While  the  1980s  are 
generally  known  for  reviving  economic  integration,  culminating  in  the  1987  Single 
European Act (SEA),407 attempts were made to also move the EC  into the security realm. 
Here  the  German  government  found  common  ground  with  member  states.  Genscher’s 
initiative  from  November  1981  to  extend  the  EC’s  competence  in  ‘external’  relations, 
strengthening  EPC  and  incorporating  ‘security’  issues  into  the  EC’s  domain  found  its 
way  into a  ‘Solemn Declaration’  in  Stuttgart in  1983  (Genscher  1995:  362-366).  It was 
picked  up  again  by  France  in  1984  with  a  proposal  to  revive  the  WEU,  leading to  the 
Rome  declaration  from  October  1984  in  which  EC  foreign  and  defense  ministers 
promised “to increase cooperation between member states in the field of security policy” 
(WEU  1984).  In  October  1987,  the  WEU  Ministerial  Council  adopted  a  Platform  on 
European Security Interests which declared that “we are convinced that the construction 
of an  integrated  Europe  will  remain  incomplete  as  long  as  it  does  not  include  security 
and defence” (WEU  1987). In pursuing these investments Bonn relied on the availability 
of European  partners,  particularly  France.  As  Smyser observed,  “after Reykjavik,  Kohl 
and  Mitterand  turned  to  each  other”,  intensifying  consultations  and  high-level  visits

406  The  US  participated  only reluctantly  in  meetings  in  Belgrade  (1978)  and  Madrid  (1981-83), 
which  were  characterized  by  clashes  with  Moscow.  In  the  latter  meeting  the  US  agreed  on 
signing a final declaration only after Kohl persuaded Reagan to do so (Lucas 2001: 70).
407 On the negotiations leading to the SEA, see Moravcsik (1991).

which  produced  also  bilateral  initiatives  like the joint Franco-German  Brigade  (Smyser 
1990:  59).

While playing the  ‘European card’  (Krieger 2001:  195),  Kohl  did not want to loosen ties 
with  the  US.  He  remained  sensitive  to  a  warning  from  the  State  Department  in  March 
1985  to  WEU  members  not  to  seek  common  positions  on  security/defense  matters 
outside NATO (Lundestad  1998:  111) and endorsed the emphasis in the  1987  ‘Platform’ 
that  the  revival  of  WEU  was  to  occur  within  NATO  and  for  the  sole  purpose  “to 
strengthen the European pillar of the Alliance” (WEU  1987;  see also  SEA, Title III 6(a) 
and (c)). Still, Smyser notes, Washington realized that “the German moves towards Paris 
represented  a  kind  of  insurance  policy  that  reflected  some  German  doubts  about  the 
United States” (Smyser  1990:  61).

Unification and the Question of Germany-in-Europe
The ‘end of the Cold War’ did not bring about a radical change in the German-American 
relationship. The period  surrounding the years  1989/90 -  the fall  of the Berlin  Wall and 
the  formal  unification  of ‘Germany’  -  followed  by the  dissolution  of the  Soviet  Union 
and  the  Warsav  Pact,  is  generally  considered  a  transformative  ‘moment’  in  European 
order.  Yet  from  a  phenomenological  perspective  for  there  to  be  change  within  ‘the 
world’  friends  disclose  and  build  together  it  must  be  incorporated  into  their  meaning 
structures  as  ‘change’.  In  other words,  this  period  did  not  designate a  historical  ‘break’ 
unless  it  was  construed  as  such.  Hence,  without  denying  Timothy  Garton  Ash’s 
observation  that  between  November  1989  and  October  1990  “more  happened  in  ten 
months than usually does in ten years. The whole map of Europe was -  or began to be -  
redrawn” (Ash  1993:  343), the point is that the  ‘redrawing’  of the European map did not 
happen  on  a tabula rasa but  occurred within existing narratives  of authentic  becoming. 
And  these  narratives,  by  definition,  are  coherent  (‘stable’).  German  and  American 
policymakers  were  giving  meaning  to  ‘what  is  happening’  and  channelled  it  in  a 
direction that strengthened the project they  invested  in.  Even though both sides saw  ‘the 
end  of  the  Cold  War’  as  an  opportunity  for  reinvigorating  the  relationship  and  the 
Western  project,  as discussed  below their different views about the  place of ‘Europe’  in 
the same were carried over.

Bonn’s Agenda of ‘Continuity’
In  1989  the  overarching  concern  for  the  Kohl  government  was  that  the  dynamic 
witnessed  in  the  GDR  and  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  would  be  channeled  into  the 
‘right  direction’.  This  direction  was  given  by  the  vision  of  Germany-in-Europe

271

formulated  and  fostered  in  Bonn  over  the  years.  And  so,  while  formal  unification  of 
FRG  and  GDR  changed  the  physical  appearance  of  ‘Germany’,  adding  population, 
territory and,  in March  1991, full  legal sovereignty, from national biography perspective 
also  “unification  amounted  to 
little  more  than  a  takeover  of  the  GDR  by  the 
Bundesrepublik” (Markovits and Reich  1997: 24).

The  Kohl  government’s desire to  keep the  ‘Germany’  narrative  stable  found  expression 
in  a  policy  of  ‘continuity’.  As  Kohl  promised  his  NATO  colleagues  on  4  December 
1989,  there  would  be  no  German  ‘special  path’  (Kohl  1996:  188).  Indeed,  as  Mark 
Duffield  notes,  Bonn’s  commitment to  ‘continuity’  appeared  to  become an  end  in  itself 
(Duffield  1998:  66). Under a policy of continuity, the  usable pasts and desirable futures 
lending coherent meaning to the narrative of Germany-in-Europe were merely adjusted. 
As  President  Richard  von  Weizsaecker  put  it  “Germany  has  become  a  completely 
Western  country and  will  fully remain  so following unification”  (in  Duffield  1998:  63). 
The  government  remained  dedicated  to  the  idea  of European  unity,  manifested  in  the 
revised  preamble  of  the  Basic  Law  committing  the  German  people  to  European 
integration.  At  the  first  congress  of  the  reunited  CDU  in  1991  Kohl  claimed  that 
“German unity  and  European  unity are two  sides of the  same coin”  and that “Europe  is 
our future” (cited  in Markovitz and Reich  1997:  45).408 In short, unified Germany was to 
continue  to  exist  as  a  ‘Civilian  Power’,  as  a  ‘normal’  liberal  democratic  and  peaceful 
state in the Western world committed to building a united Europe.

By  emphasizing  ‘continuity’  the  government  attempted  to  prevent  a  reopening  of the 
infamous  ‘German  question’.409  More  precisely,  the  ‘continuity’  strategy  was  so 
important because Kohl knew that the question of which was the  ‘normal’ Germany was 
back  on  the  table.  Neighbours  in  both  East  and  West  continued  to  harbour  concerns 
about ‘Germany’  falling back into its ‘old’  Third Reich being and reviving its hegemonic 
aspirations.  Not  surprisingly,  these  concerns  were  strongest  among  those  who  had  the 
most intense experiences of the belligerent ‘Germany’, namely France and Britain  in the 
West,  where  German  unification  had  a  “seriously  unsettling  effect”  (Markovits  and 
Reich  1997:  134), and Russia and Poland in the East.  In these countries, the  ‘pessimist’s 
view’  prevailed as the  ‘Germany’  narrative had not or only partly shifted away from the

408  Hence  I  disagree  with  Ash’s  characterization  that  unification  was  “closer  to  Adenauer 
hopes...than it was to Brandt’s” and that it was “fundamentally different from anything that West 
Germany had done, dealt with, envisaged,  or planned in  its Ostpolitik” (Ash  1993:  343, emphasis 
added).  While  the  precise  timing  and  circumstances  were  envisaged  in  neither  of  the  two 
narratives,  the  unification  process  unfolded  within  the  familiar  horizons  of  experience  and 
expectations characterizing both  Westintegration and Ostpolitik.

negative  image  anchored  in  the  memory  space  created  by  the  Third Reich  (Markovits 
and  Reich  1997:  50-55,  also  chapters  4,  8  and  9;  Ash  1993).  And  given  the  important 
role  these  countries  played  in  enabling  German  unity  to take  place,410  Bonn’s  effort to 
maintain the ‘Germany-in-Europe’ narrative made perfect sense.

Facing a process in which the four victorious WWII powers were negotiating about how 
to  situate  a  united  ‘Germany-in-Europe’,  Bonn  was  dealing,  once  again,  with  its 
‘Potsdam  complex’.  Kohl’s  strategy to tame the anxiety and  influence the terms of how 
Germany was  unfolding  in  1989/90 was to  rely  heavily on  Bonn’s  intimate relationship 
with Washington.  For instance, in the run-up to a summit between Bush and Gorbatchev 
in Malta in  late November  1989, he sought repeated reassurance from  Bush that  ‘Malta’ 
would  not  become  another  ‘Yalta’,  which,  just  like  Potsdam,  stood  for  great  powers 
deciding  over  the  future  order  of  Germany-in-Europe.411  Indeed,  there  is  general 
agreement  among  analysts  and  involved  officials  that  the  process  leading  to  German 
unification  was  marked  by  an  extraordinary  degree  of close  cooperation  between  the 
FRG  and the US,  captured  in what Robert Hutchings calls a “Bonn-Washington nexus” 
(Hutchings  1997:  109)412

Bush and the Question o f ‘Europe ’
In  January  1989  Reagan  was  succeeded  by  his  former  Vice  President,  George  H.  W. 
Bush.  While  more  moderate/cautious  than  Reagan  and  often  described  as  a  ‘pragmatic 
realist’  sceptical about the ‘vision thing’, Bush reportedly encouraged his staff to “dream 
big dreams” (Zelikow and  Rice  1995:  24).  And these were  needed  as  his administration 
needed  to  integrate  the  events  in  Europe  into  the  narrative  of America-in-the  world. 
While  a “lonely  superpower”  in  military terms (Krauthammer  1991),  from  a friendship 
perspective the US did not seek to build the post-Cold War world on  its own.  Instead,  it 
was  first  and  foremost  looking  for  someone  in  ‘Europe’  to  rebuild  the  Western  space 
with rather than against someone.

On  the  one  hand,  the  understanding  was  that  the  US  had  won  the  Cold  War  and  that 
‘freedom’  had  prevailed  lead  to  what  Snyder  (1992)  calls  “end-of-history  optimism” 
about  the  superiority  of  (American)  values  of  economic  and  political 
liberalism 
(Fukuyama  1992). At the same time, the changes in Europe and the disappearance of the

4,0  Poland  due  to  the  unsolved  legal  status  of ‘Germany’s  Eastern  border,  which  Kohl  initially 
tried to keep open, see Hutchings (1997:  115f.).

‘order  of Yalta’  affected  the  configuration  of the  Western  space  and,  hence,  required 
adjustment  of the  Western  project.  As  one  astute  observer  pointed  out,  “the  existence 
and meaning of Europe dominated  international politics in  1989” and  ‘defining Europe’ 
once  again  became  “a  practical  problem”  (Hoagland  1989:  34).  Yet  the  Bush 
administration  had  its  difficulties  with  formulating  a  vision  of a  desirable  ‘Europe’.413 
While  willing  to  take  a  more  positive  stance  towards  European  integration  than  his 
predecessor, the lacking vision of a desirable European order had been carried over from 
Reagan.  Bush  once  described  himself as  “less  of a  Europeanist”  (in  Zelikow  and  Rice 
1995:  28) and the first months of his administration were marked by a careful attempt to 
formulate American Europapolitik.  Even when the political  dynamics in  ‘Europe’  made 
this  a  more  pressing  matter,  there  was  no  clear  sense  of  a  desirable  European  order 
beyond a general commitment to a Europe that was “whole and free” and  ‘stable’.414 As 
Robert Hutchings, Director for European Affairs with the NSC at the time, recalls:

“We  wanted  a  strong,  more  cohesive  Europe  as  our  main  partner  in 
world  affairs,  and  we  were  prepared 
lend  our  support  and 
encouragement to that end...But these  abstract judgments  still  begged 
the question of what kind of Europe” (Hutchings  1997: 29).

to 

Again,  the  question  was  whether  a  united  Europe  would  be  a  ‘natural  partner’  or  a 
competitor.  Alongside  the  hope  that  European  unity  would  “reduce  the  burden  on 
ourselves, yielding a  new transatlantic balance  of roles  and  responsibilities” (Hutchings 
1997:  158f.)  was  the  concern  of  an  emerging  ‘Fortress  Europe’.  Whereas  Bush 
reluctantly accepted the development of the EC  into a potential  economic competitor,415 
he did not want this to spill over into the security realm. Such a Europe, he feared, might 
become  “more  exclusionary  and  potentially  in  competition  with  the  Atlantic  Alliance” 
(Hutchings  1997:  29), which  is another way of saying that it would reduce Washington’s 
ability  to  shape  European  order.  The  overarching  aim  was  to  ensure  that  a  ‘united 
Europe’  remained in the Western space -  “to forge a unity based on  Western values”, as 
Bush  put  it  (in  Zelikow  and  Rice  1995:  31)  -   by  maintaining  a  permanent  American 
‘presence’  in  Europe  and  promoting  a  “new  Atlanticism”.416  As  Hutchings  recalls,  the

413  In  light of my analysis, the claim that Bush  was  “outlining a future  for a new  Europe which 
was  more  ambitious 
than  anything  his  postwar  predecessors  or,  for  that  matter,  his 
contemporaries...had  been  prepared  to  contemplate”  (Cox  and  Hurst  2002:  133)  cannot  be 
upheld.
414  An  NSR  document  on  ‘Comprehensive  Review  of US-West  European  Relations’  (NSR  5) 
from  15 February  1989 remains classified.
415  The  EC’s  emergence  as  an  economic  ‘block’  yet  its  diffuse  Gestalt  as  a negotiating partner 
during the  1991  Uruguay Round frustrated the Bush administration (Hutchings  1997:  159f.).

aim of keeping the US  ‘in’  Europe was “our central vision and key organizing principle” 
and the driving force behind a new European strategy group (Hutchings  1997:  157).

While  the  question  remained  what  exactly  the  US  would  do  with  its  European 
‘presence’,  it  was  clear  to  the  Bush  administration  that  the  ‘European  question’  was 
intertwined  with the  ‘German question’.  An NSC  memorandum from  March  1989  held 
that  “the  top  priority  for  American  foreign  policy  in  Europe  should  be  the  fate  of the 
Federal  Republic  of Germany...we  cannot  have  a  vision  for  Europe’s  future  that  does 
not  include  an  approach  to the  ‘German question’”  (in  Zelikow and  Rice  1995:  26-28). 
The  US  commitment to  build  ‘Europe’  with  Germany  was  reflected  in  Bush’s  Mainz 
speech  from  May  1989,  in  which  he  famously  declared  the  two  countries  to  become 
“partners  in  leadership”.  Indeed, given the amount of attention  Germany received  at the 
time,  Hutchings  feels  compelled  to  remind  that  among  US  policymakers  “in  1990  the 
question  was  not  so  much  about  Germany  but  about  the  European  order  into  which  it 
needed to fit” (Hutchings  1997:  141).

The  *Bonn-Washington Nexus’
Although there were voices who continued to see the division  of Germany-in-Europe as 
a  stable  source  of peace,  the  possibility  of overcoming of the  status quo  was  cautiously 
accepted  in  the  White  House,  with  the  NSC  memorandum  recommending  “we  should 
offer  some  promise  for change” to  Germany (in  Zelikow and  Rice  1995:  26-28).  In  an 
attempt  to  give  meaning  to  events  and  move  them  in  a  fruitful  direction,  the  Bush 
administration  resorted  to  the  view  that the  American  narrative  had  always  envisioned 
German  unity as  a good thing.  Thus,  once the  possibility was  raised  by Kohl, the  Bush 
administration was supportive and gave ‘Germany’ a strong voice in the process to “take 
the  lead  in  deciding (its)  future”  (Hutchings  1997:  97,  113).  With  that,  the  US  position 
differed  significantly from the sceptical  views held  by Germany’s European  neighbours. 
In  September  1989  he  denounced  the  view  prevalent  “in  some  quarters”  that  a  unified 
Germany would be detrimental to the peace of Europe (in Nye and Keohane  1993:  117). 
Reminiscent of the supportive attitude during the post-45  decade, Bush trusted that Kohl 
was moving Germany in the right direction:  “I felt that Germany had  learned its  lesson” 
(cited in Bering  1999:  135).

To  be  sure,  even  though  the  Bush  administration  saw  in  ‘Kohl  Germany’  a  loyal  and 
reliable  partner,  the  ‘Rapallo’  complex  -   the  concern  that  a  Germany  striving  for 
unification might accept the status of ‘neutrality’  to accommodate Soviet demands -  did 
not  disappear  (Hutchings  1997:  107).  While  full  of  praise  of  Kohl’s  pro-Western

275

orientation  and  his  commitment  to  NATO,  US  officials  continued  to  be  wary  of 
Genscher and the direction he seemed to represent. Many in the Bush administration saw 
Genscher  as  “undercutting  Western  positions”  (Bering  1999:  138).417  Hutchings  puts  it 
diplomatically:  “it was  simply that Kohl  was seen  as more reliable than  Genscher when 
it  came  to  the  integrity  of  the  Western  alliance”  (Hutchings  1997:  19).  To  prevent 
‘Genscherism’  from  becoming  too  influential,  keeping  Bonn  close  and  strengthening 
Kohl’s position thus only gained in importance.

The American offer for renewing the partnership was welcomed by Kohl, who described 
Bush  as “the most important ally on  the path to unification...capable of real  friendship” 
(Kohl  1996:  185;  also Zelikow and  Rice  1995:  187).  The  seemed to  be  confirmed  with 
Kohl’s  famous  ‘Ten  Point  Plan’  from  27  November,  a  road  map  for  unification  which 
combined  elements  of Ostpolitik with  elements  of ‘change  through  strength’.  It  was  a 
clear  signal  of Kohl  claiming  agency  in  defining  the  path  of ‘Germany-in-Europe’,  as 
the plan was devised by Kohl  without consulting the Western allies,  or Genscher.418 Yet 
whereas  London  and  Paris  criticized  Kohl’s  handling  and  the  content  of  the  plan  -  
Mitterand  expressed  his  concern  that  ‘Europe  could  fall  back  into  the  imagined  world 
( Vorstellungswelt) of 1913’ (Kohl  1996:  183f.) -  Washington accepted both and worked 
on  rallying  Britain  and  France  behind  the  plan.  And when  Kohl  asked  Bush  to  support 
the points  in his meeting with Gorbachev, the President assured  him that “we are on the 
same  wavelength”  and  told  reporters  afterwards  “I  feel  comfortable...I  think  we’re  on 
track” (Kohl  1996:  157-167;  Zelikow and Rice  1995:  120ff;  Hutchings  1997:  99).  From 
a  US  perspective,  the  track  was  a  reorganization  of  the  Western  space  and  given 
Germany’s potential there was “much to gain from the prospect of a strong, democratic, 
and united Germany” (Hutchings  1997: 97).

This  last  claim  hints  at  why  the  close  and  productive  relationship  over  German 
unification  did  not  halt  the  process  the  estrangement.  Mutual  support  for  ‘world 
building’  was  not  supposed  to  end  with  German  unification.  Whereas  in  Bonn,  the 
expectation  was  that  the  US  would  also  be  there  to  ‘complete’  the  unification  of 
‘Europe’,  in Washington Kohl’s commitment to the West was seen as a guarantee that a 
unified Germany would be a creative partner in reordering the Western space on a global 
scale  and  with  military  means,  if necessary.  As  the  remaineder  of this  chapter  shows,

417 As Risse (1997:  161,  172f.) rightly points out, US suspicion of Genscher and the downplaying 
of his role in the unification process also pervades the account of Zelikow and Rice (1995).
418 According to Kohl, he  informed Bush  about the plan a few hours before everyone else  (Kohl 
1996:  167-176).

276

both expectations remained unfulfilled. The consensus on German unification as a ‘good 
thing’  did  not  encompass  the  question  what  space  this  ‘new’  Germany  would  be 
embedded in and what ‘world building’  project it would contribute to.

The Ambiguity of the Western Project
Two  formative  events,  the  1991  Gulf  War  and  the  conflict  in  Bosnia,  exposed  the 
fragility of the Bonn-Washington nexus. The meaning attributed to them and,  hence, the 
place  these  events  took  in  the  project  of building  a  post-Cold  War  world  exposed  the 
dissonance  between  German  and  American  ideas  of order.  The  1991  Gulf War  made 
clear  that  German  commitment  to  ‘continuity’  had  failed  to  take  into  account  the 
American  understanding  of the  Western  project,  in  particular  its  ‘global’  scope  and  its 
acceptance  of war as  a means  for creating  an  order where  peace  was  achieved through 
freedom.  The conflict  in  Bosnia exposed the  second  fault  line  in  the  German-American 
project  or,  more  precisely,  another  aspect  of the  divergence:  it  revealed  the  American 
indecisiveness  about  how  to  order  ‘Europe’  and  its  hesitancy  to  stress  ‘unity’  as  a 
reading of peace and,  correspondingly,  its ability to accommodate the German vision of 
a  European  Peace Order.  Together, they motivated the  Kohl  government to  invest,  with 
France as the main partner, in CFSP as an alternative to CSCE and NATO.

Exposing Dissonance I:  Gulf War 1991
In  August  1990,  one  week  following the  invasion  of Kuwait  by  Iraqi  forces,  President 
Bush  announced  large-scale  military  assistance  for  Saudi  Arabia  and  asked  for  allied 
support.  In  an  attempt to  place  this  event  and  the  US  response  in  a  meaningful  frame 
which  purported  to  “keep  the  dangers  of  disorder  at  bay”,  on  September  11  Bush 
announced  to  a  joint  session  of  Congress  a  ‘New  World  Order’  (NWO)  under  the 
auspices  of  American  leadership  (in  Kennan  1991:  26;  Hutchings  1997:  146f.).  In 
formulating  this  vision  Bush  could  not  quite  resist  “the  Wilsonian  temptation” 
(Hutchings  1997:  149)  of making  the  world  safe  for  democracy  and  echoed  familiar 
traits  of American  liberal  internationalism,  supplemented with  the  promise  for reviving 
the  United  Nations  as  a  forum  for  debating  and  enforcing  order.419  A  month  later  in 
Prague,  he  wove  together the  task  of fulfilling  “the  promise  of a  Europe...that  is  truly 
whole  and  free”  and  a  ‘Europe’  that  would  accept new  responsibilities  and  “work with 
us  in  common  cause  toward  a  new  commonwealth  of freedom...,  a  moral  community 
united  in  its dedication to free  ideals...(t)hat is why our response to the challenge  in the 
Persian Gulf is critical” (in Hutchings  1997:  147f.).

419 On the ‘New World Order’  concept, see Nye (1991); Buzan (1995); Van Hoonacker (2001).

277

While  the  Bush  administration  expected  Germany,  the  creative  partner  in  the  Western 
space, to be part of this response, the Kohl  government decided to  lay  low.420 Although 
it condemned  Iraq’s actions as a breach of international  law and  supported the set-up of 
sanctions,  it  did  not  want  to  share  political  responsibilities  for  military  engagement. 
While there were  intense domestic debates  and  calls for a diplomatic solution, the Kohl 
government’s external  response to  the  outbreak  of hostilities  was  perceived  as  “largely 
one of awkward silence” (Duffield  1998:  180).  Bonn only dispatched at the last possible 
moment  and  after  a  long,  and  for  external  observers  incomprehensible,  debate  over 
Germany’s alliance obligations a small number of fighter jets to Turkey, which were not 
allowed to participate in any offensive action.

The  decision  not  to  participate  militarily  in  the  campaign  against  Iraq  was  explained 
with the value of anti-militarism marking the German narrative. The government argued 
that articles 87a and 26 of the Basic Law restricted the German security space to ‘NATO 
territory’  and  that  Bundeswehr  engagement  in  ‘out-of-area’  operations  were  hence 
illegitimate,  a  position  which  was  echoed  across  party 
lines.421  O f  course,  the 
constitutional  constrains  were  not  as  decisive  as  the  government put  it;422  Kohl  simply 
was guided by the understanding that offensive military action was not part of normality, 
more precisely, where war was not seen as an acceptable continuation of politics but the 
breakdown  thereof.  Foreign  policy  of unified  Germany  was  to  remain  ‘peace  policy’ 
(Friedenspolitik),  aimed  at  making  war  a  thing  of  the  past  (Berger  1996;  Duffield 
1998).423  As  such,  Bonn’s  response  was  a  logical  consequence  of  the  ‘continuity’ 
strategy  with  which  the  government  sought  to  maintain  the  familiar  narrative  of 
‘Germany’  and assure both domestic and external audiences that unified Germany would 
remain a ‘civilian power’.424

To its surprise, the German government earned harsh criticism from the US officials and 
the American media, accusing Germany of being a ‘reluctant ally’  and a  ‘free rider’.  At 
the  heart  of  this  critique  was  a  sense  of  lacking  reciprocity,  specifically 
the 
government’s unwillingness to publicly share the political responsibility and to carry the

423  The  governments  decision  was  accompanied  by  massive  anti-war  demonstrations  all  over 
Germany, with about 200.000 people protesting in Bonn in  late January (see Duffield  1998:  180).

because it was ‘distracted’ by unification.

political  burdens  for  an  operation  which  Washington  perceived  to  be  in  the  “common 
interest of the West” (Bluth 2000:  57). Bonn’s refusal to openly lend political  support to 
Desert  Storm  was  perceived  as  a  sign  of  lacking  solidarity  and  unappreciative  of 
American  support  in  the  unification  process  and  left  the  Bush  administration  “very 
disenchanted” (Hutchings).  Bush warned that “to conclude that these  challenges are not 
everyone’s  concern”  would  put  “at  risk  everything  we  have  achieved”  (Riddell  1990). 
Similarly,  the  US  media  commented  that  “German  wobbling  puts  the  Trans-Atlantic 
partnership  at  risk”  (Hutchings  1997;  Hoagland,  1991;  Fehr  1991).  While  Bonn  ended 
up contributing DM  18 billion to Operation Desert Storm, a sum amounting to more than 
one-third  of  its  annual  defense-budget  and  over  half  of  which  went  directly  to 
Washington  (Otte  2000:  93),  in  Washington  the  German  contribution  was  considered 
“too little, too late” (McArdle Kelleher  1993: 275).

Quo vadis, Germany?
As  the  friendship  lens  would  expect,  the  American  criticism  caused  anxiety  in  Bonn. 
The  US  perception  of unified  Germany  as  a  ‘free  rider’  which  was  not  contributing  to 
the  Western  project  was  destabilizing  because  it  exposed  a  disconnection  between 
German  and  American  horizons  of  expectations.  Paradoxically,  Kohl’s  attempt  to 
maintain  ‘continuity’  had  produced  the  opposite  effect:  it  raised  questions  of whether 
‘Germany’  really  was  a  reliable  and  trustworthy  partner  in  the  West.  To  counter  this 
unpleasant  dynamic,  the  government  saw  a  need  to  re-evaluate  the  understanding  of 
Germany 
foreign  policy 
spokesperson  for  the  CDU,  the  impact  of  the  Gulf  War  on  German  politics  was 
“cathartic”  (Lamers  1991b).  As  Defense  Minister  Volker  Ruehe  (CDU)  phrased  it,  the 
Gulf War had cast “a bright light on the need to redefine united Germany’s international 
role”  (in  Duffield  1998:  181).  The  Kohl  government  came  to  realize  that just  when 
‘Germany’  had  become a coherent and  stable  narrative as  ‘normal’  state  in the  Western 
space, the contours of this space were changing.

the  world.  According 

in 

to  Karl  Lamers, 

influential 

It was not so much that the US  had extended the spatial horizons of the Western project 
-  after  all  it  had  done  so  many times  before with  engagements  in  Korea and Vietnam, 
and  with  trying  to  include  Japan  in  the  Western  world.  The  key  problem  was  that 
becoming  a  creative  agent  in  the  New  World  Order  required  adapting  the  German 
‘Civilian power’  narrative embedded  in the vision of unfolding  into a Greater European 
Peace  Order.  Such  an  adaptation  was  extremely  difficult.  When  Ruehe  conceded  that 
Germany  had  to  face  a  new  reality  in  which  “war...has  returned  as  an  instrument  of 
politics”  (Ruehe  1992),  this  ‘reality’  stood  in  stark  contrast  to  the  world  in  which

279

Germany  had  unfolded  since  1945  and  where  it  gained  its  sense  of  authentic  being 
through  the  conviction  that,  in  the  words  of  Brandt,  war  was  “the  ultima  irratio  of 
politics” (in Baumann and Hellmann 2001:  70).

Yet the Kohl  government had to come to terms that for Washington  a unified Germany 
was a  ‘new’  Germany in the  sense of it being a more  ‘powerful’  partner expected to act 
‘accordingly’.  Karl  Lamers  reminded  in  an  internal  paper  that  “responsibility  is 
contingent upon  power”  and  warned  that  German  denial  about  its  power  could  lead  its 
Western  partners to think the country was back on a Sonderweg:  “If Germany acts as  if 
it  has  no  power,  it  will  awaken  only  mistrust  among  its  neighbors.  Germany  must 
therefore  acknowledge  its  power”  (cited  in  Anderson  and  Goodman  1993:  48).  It  is 
worth  reminding  here  that,  as  discussed  in  chapter  six,  ‘power’  here  is  understood  as 
creative potential.  Unification  had  not suddenly brought more economic and/or military 
capabilities;  if  anything,  the  costs  of  incorporating  the  former  GDR  were  draining 
German resources.  Rather, the question was how to use the creative potential of unified 
Germ any-in-Europe, how to adjust the German narrative without losing its authenticity.

Thus, the question was how to re-engage its memory space and draw new lessons from  it 
without discarding the vision of a peaceful  Germany-in-Europe. This dilemma was well 
captured  in  Lamers’  remark that “without forgetting  its  history,  Germany must become 
as  normal  as  possible”  (in  Anderson  and  Goodman  1993:  48).  The  government 
addressed  this dilemma with  contradicting and vague assurances to  its  Western  partners 
that German foreign policy would remain “marked by continuity” while at the same time 
stressing 
its  “reliability  and  calculability”  (Kinkel  1992).  Such  promises  were 
problematic,  of course,  as  they  implied  that  Germany  would  remain  on  its  ‘familiar’ 
path,  the  definition  of  which  had  become  less  clear.  Thus  they  were  followed  by 
promises 
for  “new  developments”  (Ibid.).  Yet  such 
‘developments’ de facto required a reinterpretation of the desirable order ‘Germany’ was 
unfolding  into,  that  is,  the  project  unified  Germany  was  responsible  for (Baumann  and 
Hellmann 2001). The question, then, became with whom, in advance of what project and 
through  which  institution  this  potential  could  be  used  and  where  the  coherence  of 
Germany’s biography could be restored without too much adjustment.

Signs of Institutional Rivalry
Scholars  like to  argue that  Bonn  and  Washington  agreed  to  embed  a unified  Germany- 
in-Europe  in NATO,  CSCE,  and  EC/WEU,  satisfying the  various  parties  involved,  and 
that  these  were  ‘interlocking’  institutions  complementing  each  other  (Anderson  and

280

Goodman  1993:  39ff).425  The  theoretical  lens  applied  here  suggests,  instead,  that  Bonn 
invested  in  those  three  institutional  frames  to  assess  through  which  it  could  offset  the 
dissonance  with  the  US  exposed  by the  Gulf War,  that  is,  which  was  most suitable  for 
negotiating its national biography without losing its sense of authenticity.426

For reasons noted earlier, the Bush administration made it clear to Kohl that it expected 
unified  Germany  to  remain  in  NATO,  a  requirement  shared  by  France  and  Britain  in 
their  reluctant  agreement to  unification  (Zelikow  and  Rice  1995:  13If,  141,  154).  The 
US National  Security  Strategy from  March  1990  stressed that NATO was to remain the 
primary security  institution  in  Europe which  “sustains the  overall  structure  of stability” 
(in  Theiler 2003:  185).  And  while  Kohl  did  not  mention  NATO  in  his  T en   Points’,  he 
repeatedly  assured  Bush  of the  German  commitment  to  NATO  (Hutchings  1997:  100; 
Kohl  1996:  166).  Yet as noted earlier, the German commitment to NATO was reading it 
through  the  Harmel  Report  as  an  institution  through  which  a  unified  Germany  in  a 
Greater  European  Peace  Order  could  be  built.  In  December  1989  Kohl  noted  to  his 
NATO  colleagues 
in  which  all 
Europeans...come  together  in  freedom”  (Kohl  1996:  189).  Bush  appeared  to  confirm 
this  reading  at  the  same  meeting  by  stating  that  the  Alliance  was  to  provide  “the 
architecture for continued peaceful  change” (in Zelikov and  Rice  1997:  132).  With that 
assurance,  Kohl  signed  up  to  NATO’s  London  declaration  from  July  1990  which 
proclaimed  NATO  as  the  primary  security  institution  in  Europe  and  agreed  to  its 
function as “the principle venue for consultations” in May  1991  (Hutchings  1997: 279).

the  goal  was  “a  European  peace  order 

that 

However,  Bonn’s  hope  that  NATO  would  transform  into  a  forum  for  negotiating  a 
Greater  European  Peace  Order  was  compromised  by  US  plans  to  build  a  New  World 
Order  beyond  Europe.  Although  NATO  was  not  formally  involved  in  the  1991  Gulf 
War,  in  the  eyes  of the  US  the  operation  served  to  redefine  NATO’s  scope  as  a  more 
globally oriented institution an attempt which, as we have seen, can be traced back to the 
late  1960s.  The  strategic  concept  agreed  upon  in  Rome  in  November  1991  suggested 
that  the  scope  of NATO  missions  was  not  limited  to  Europe  by  noting  that  “Alliance 
security must take account of the global  context” (NATO  1991,  §  12) and that members 
“could...be called upon to contribute to global stability” (Ibid,  §  41).  It also emphasized

425 The notion of ‘interlocking institutions’ was stated in NATO’s  1991  Rome communique.
426 Although  outside the  scope  of this  analysis,  Germany’s  attempt to participate  in  formulating 
Bush’s  ‘New  World  Order’  included  investment  in  the  United  Nations  (UN).  The  Kohl 
government  advocated  the  importance  of  international  law,  supported  UN  ‘peacekeeping’ 
missions  and bid  for a permanent  seat  in  the  Security  Council  (Ruehe,  1992a;  Thraenert,  1993; 
Kuehne  1996; Daalgard Nielsen 2006).

the  continued  primacy of conventional  and  nuclear  capabilities  and  cleared  the  ground 
for the  1992  Oslo  agreement which  expanded  NATO’s  strategic  scope  by  adopting the 
possibility  of  ‘out  of  area’  missions  authorized  by  the  UN  Security  Council.  The 
doctrinal  shift  towards  ‘power  projection’,  pushed  forward  by  the  US  military,  largely 
sidetracked the political debate (Schake  1998; Sandler and Hartley  1997:  60).

In  light of the Iraq experience, these adjustments did not resonate well  in  Bonn.  Yet the 
Gulf War ‘defection’  had politically weakened the Kohl government and left it with little 
influence  in the negotiations  over NATO’s  military strategy,  exemplified by complaints 
coming out of the Ministry of Defense about ‘unilateral’  decision-making among NATO 
allies,  a  ‘nationalization’  of  NATO,  and  of  being  downgraded  to  a  ‘second-class 
member’ (Honig,  1992; Thraenert,  1993).

The  Kohl  government was more successful  in  persuading the  US to strengthen the non­
military  dimension  of NATO  and  reach  out  in  cooperation  with  Central  and  Eastern 
Europe.  Genscher  played  a key  role  in  inserting commitments to  preventive  diplomacy 
into  the  Rome  document  which  emphasized  the  importance  of CSCE  (Genscher  1995: 
787ffi;  Otte 2000:  170f).  Yet  for Washington this  link  was  a  concession  to  Bonn  in  an 
attempt  to  keep  it  from  investing  in  alternative  institutions  rather  that  a  genuine 
determination  to  transform  NATO  in  this  direction.  While  the  Bush  administration 
accepted the  ‘Helsinki Principles’  as  part of the negotiations  about Germany’s future  in 
an  ‘All-European  process’  and  saw  CSCE  as  a  potentially  useful  instrument  for 
promoting political and  economic liberalism  in  Eastern Europe (Hutchings  1997:  191 f.)» 
at bottom  it still  considered  CSCE a  ‘Soviet design’  resurfacing  in  Gorbatchev’s vision 
of  a  ‘Common  European  Home’  and,  hence,  “the  most  unwieldly  European  forum 
imaginable” (Hoagland  1989; Zelikow and Rice  1995;  127,  133).

Whereas the  US  gave  only  low  key  and  last-minute  support  for CSCE  meetings,  Bonn 
held  high  expectations  for this  institution  (Genscher  1995:  320).  In  his  Ten  Point Plan 
Kohl  had  described  the  CSCE  process  as  the  heart  piece  of  the  ‘Greater  European’ 
architecture  and  the  government  put  great  efforts  in  revitalizing  it  (Kohl  1996:  165f., 
Peters  1999).  As  one  astute  observer notes,  in  the  reform  process  of CSCE and the  EC 
the  Germans  were  “the  movers  and  shapers”  (Pond  1991:  125).  The  assessment  that 
CSCE  could  be  used  for  building  a  Greater  European  Peace  Order  was  widespread 
around the time of its  rejuvenation  in November  1990  with  the  ‘Charter of Paris’,  and, 
indeed,  the  view  that  CSCE  might  be  a  potential  alternative  to  NATO  was  not

282

uncommon across the political spectrum.427

The  most significant move, however, occurred  in the reform of the EC. As noted earlier, 
the  main  partner  in  the  EC  was  France,  which  had  made  Kohl’s  commitment  to 
European  integration  a precondition  for supporting German  unification.  Building on the 
dynamic  from  the  1980s,  the  idea  of  European  unity  was  taken  head  on  during  the 
Intergovernmental  Conference  (IGC)  in  1990/91,  where  Bonn  and  Paris  shifted  the 
emphasis  of  the  EC  from  economic  to  political  unity.  An  initiative  by  Kohl  and 
Mitterand from December  1990 called for a strengthening of the Community’s political 
and  security  realm,  followed  by a number of further Franco-German  initiatives pushing 
for the integration of the WEU into the EU and suggesting to expand the German-Franco 
brigade into a multinational corps answerable to the EU (‘the Eurocorps’) (Meiers 2006: 
125-138).  This  set  the  agenda  for  negotiations  among  EC  members  leading  to  the 
integration of the EPC  into the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and to the creation 
of  a  pillar  of  ‘Common  Foreign  and  Security  Policy’  (CFSP)  within  the  EU’s  new 
institutional  framework. By pushing for the prospect of having defence  issues discussed 
in the EU, the Treaty broke with the understanding that ‘defence’  was a term exclusively 
reserved for NATO (Hill and Smith 2000:  152).428

That these developments in the EC did  not quite fit Bush’s  ‘Atlantic frame’  and  laid the 
groundwork  for  a  potential  alternative  to  NATO  was  recognized  in  Washington.  The 
Bush  administration  worried  that  Kohl  was  responding  to  French  overtures  of creating 
an  institution  which  was  “taking  Germany  farther  away”  from  NATO  and  responded 
sharply.  In  the  ‘Bartholomew-telegram’  from  February  1991 
the  US  warned  EC 
members rather undiplomatically not to undertake “efforts to construct a European pillar 
by redefining and limiting NATO’s role” (Meiers 2006:  219). Later that year at NATO’s 
Rome summit Bush claimed that the US was “an unhesitating proponent of the aim  and 
process  of European  integration”  yet  warned  that  this  should  not  lead  to  a  “European 
alternative  to  the  Alliance”.  Behind  close  doors,  he  bluntly  asked  “if Western  Europe 
intends  to  create  a  security  organization  outside  the  Alliance,  tell  me  now!’’(Hutchings 
1997:  277-281).

The  American  warnings  effectively  put  German  commitment to  NATO  on  the  spot.  In 
an  attempt to  alleviate  tensions  Bonn  reassured  Washington  that NATO  was  to  remain

the  primary  security  institution.  The  purpose  of CFSP  was  not  to  establish  a  rival  to 
NATO  but,  resorting to Kennedy’s metaphor, to  strengthen the  ‘European  pillar’  of the 
Atlantic Alliance and, as such, to bring France closer to NATO. To this end, the German 
government  successfully  lobbied  for  the  ominous  European  Security  and  Defense 
Identity (ESDI) within NATO  and  came to echo the  British  view that  WEU  served  as a 
‘bridge’  within NATO  (Tams  1999;  Kirchner 2000;  Theiler 2003:  184ff;  Hilz 2005).  In 
turn,  Bush  renewed  his  offer  for  building  the  New  World  Order  as  partners  in 
leadership,429  and  he  expressed  his  hope  that  “a  more  united  Europe  offers  the  United 
States a more effective partner, prepared for larger responsibilities” (in Lundestad  1998: 
116).  However,  the  estrangement  dynamic  could  not  be  reversed.  As  the  next  section 
shows,  the  German-American dissonance  over the  meaning of the  Western  project  was 
further exposed over the question how to respond to the conflict in Bosnia.

Exposing Dissonance II: Bosnia (1992-95)
Tensions  among  groups  in  the  Former  Republic  of Yugoslavia  (FRY)  had  been  rising 
since  1991  and  in  Bosnia  war  broke  out  in  April  1992.  The  ‘Europe’  this  conflict 
portrayed was  neither  ‘whole’  nor  ‘free’,  let alone  ‘at peace’.  Yet  between  Washington 
and  Bonn  there  was  no  consensus  as  to  what  this  conflict  meant,  that  is,  how  it  was 
integrated into the Western project and how to engage it.

In contrast to the Gulf War,  the US  government decided  to  play a  low-key role and  not

the  US  “shares  Europe’s 
neighbourhood”,431  the Bush  administration now applied a very narrow  interpretation  of 
the  Western  space  and  considered the  Balkans  as  peripheral  to  its  agenda of building a 
post-Cold  War  world.  As  such,  NATO  was  not  to  become  involved.  In  the  words  of 
NATO’s  Supreme  Allied  Command  Europe,  the  Balkans  were  “not  within  NATO’s 
defense zone” (in  Hutchings  1997:  308).  Robert Hutchings’  recollection that “We never 
decided  whether  important  US  interests  were  at  stake.  We  never  decided  whether 
Yugoslavia  mattered  enough”  (Hutchings  1997:  312)  is  revealing  in  itself,  yet  US

429  Bush  noted to  Weizsaecker in  1992:  “Just as  Germany  has transcended...its past,  so  has the 
German-American  relationship  shed the  burdens that were  history’s  legacy.  A  united  Germany, 
champion  of a more  united  Europe,  now stands  as  our partner in  leadership.  Together,  we  have 
achieved our common  goal  of a Germany  united  in  peace  and  freedom.  But  our partnership did 
not end with that.  To the contrary:  now that we are free of the dangers and divisions of Europe’s 
Cold  War  confrontation,  the  German-American  partnership  has  really  just  begun.”  (cited  in 
Hutchings  1997:  162).

passivity  indicates  —  and  others,  like  Senator  John  McCain,  noted  more  openly  — that 
neither  was  the  case.432  Hutchings’  acknowledgment  that the  watchword  for  American 
policy  became  “We  got no  dog  in  this  fight”  is  another way of saying that the  conflict 
did not touch on US  ‘vital  interests’ and an engagement did not seem to contribute to the 
Western  project.  As  Lene  Hansen  notes  in  her analysis  of the  US  discourse  on  Bosnian 
conflict, the Balkans were conceived  as spatially outside  ‘Western  civilisation’  (Hansen 
2006:  105ff,  136).

To be  sure,  as Hansen  (2006:  135) points out, there were voices  in  Congress calling for 
US  engagement,  but  these  remained  ineffective  until  Clinton  shifted  course  in  1995. 
Behind the American reluctance to get involved was the administration’s lack of a robust 
utopia  for  a  peaceful  ‘Europe’,  that  is,  the  missing  of  a  clear  vision  of  a  desirable 
European  order it wanted to  invest  in.  That Bush was not really committed to a Europe 
‘whole and free’  became visible  in the assessment that  ‘unity’  and  ‘freedom’  seemed to 
contradict  each  other  as  a  meaningful  principle  for  ‘peace’;  and  in  the  American 
narrative the  latter trumped the  former, with  Baker stressing on  a visit to  Belgrade that 
the  US  would  “always  choose  democracy  over  unity”  (cited  in  Hutchings  1997:  310). 
Supporting  the  principle  of self-determination  yet  not  the  unity  of ‘Europe’  was  made 
easier  in  that  Yugoslavia’s  disintegration  was  seen  as  part  of  the  process  of  self- 
determination  in Europe.

Ambiguity  concerning  the  desirability  of a  unified  Europe  was  complemented  by  the 
view  that  ‘unity’  among  people  in  the  Balkans  was  difficult,  if  not  impossible  to 
accomplish. The dominant interpretation in the Bush administration was that the fighting 
was the  inevitable  result of historical  tensions,  ‘ancient hatreds’,  which  had  been  ‘deep 
frozen’  under the East-West conflict (Hutchings  1997:  318; Hansen 2006:  107fi,  134).433 
Thus,  although  some  sceptics  saw  this  as  a  prelude  for  what  could  happen  in  all  of 
Europe  with  the  order  of Yalta  gone,  in  the  administration  the  view  prevailed  that the 
fighting was  a  ‘local’  conflict,  not representative of something  ‘bigger’.434  This  reading 
further  justified  US  non-engagement  by  integrating  the  image  of  the  Balkans  as  a 
quagmire into the American narrative through the memory of ‘Vietnam’.  With the swift 
victory  in  the  Gulf War just  having  added  an  experience  widely  seen  as  ‘overcoming’

432 McCain quoted in Hansen (2006:  134).
433  Hansen  (2006:  148-156)  attributes  the  popularity  of this  image  to  Clinton  reading  Robert 
Kaplan’s  ‘Balkan  Ghosts’.  Given  that  the  narrative  was  already  present  during  the  Bush 
administration, Hansen’s argument, in my view, exaggerates the importance of Kaplan’s text.
434 The  scenario  of the  resurfacing of “long  oppressed  ethnic  antagonism  and  national  rivalries” 
was formulated most famously by Mearsheimer (1990), who famously argued that the breakup of 
the Soviet Union would lead to new instabilities in Europe.

285

the  trauma  of  Vietnam,  the  possibility  of  becoming  entangled  in  a  civil  war  with 
complex ethnic roots  in a  ‘far away place’  trumped the humanitarian discourse (Hansen 
2006:  134,  138;  Hutchings  1997:  314).  While  Clinton  had vowed to change course,  his 
administration  maintained  its  predecessor’s  interpretation  of  the  conflict  as  one  of 
ancient hatreds and, thus, continued the passive stance until  1995 (see below).

During  the  electoral  campaign  in  1992  Clinton  had  criticized  Bush  for  “failing  to 
provide a broad  vision  of America’s  world  role”  (Hyland  1999:  16).  Once  in the  White 
House,  he  formulated  such  a  broad  (and  familiar)  role,  namely  of America  as  a  global 
force  for  the  good  life,  promoting  the  pacifying  power  of  liberal  values  and  the 
humanitarian  purpose  of  UN  peacekeeping  missions.435  National  Security  Advisor 
Anthony  Lake  described  the  strategic  outlook  of the  Clinton  administration  as  one  of 
‘pragmatic  neo-Wilsonianism’  and  ‘helping  the  helpless’,  criticized  by  others  as  an 
attempt to  “turn  American  foreign  policy  into  a  branch  of social  work”  (Mandelbaum 
1996:  18;  Hyland  1999:  58).  In  this  narrative  European  unity  was  not  a  prominent 
concern,  symbolised  by  Secretary  of  State  Warren  Christopher’s  note  that  American 
policy  had  been  too  ‘Eurocentric’  (Smith  and  Woolcock  1994;  Hyland  1999:  94).  The 
Bosnian  conflict  was  considered  a  ‘European  problem’  which  could  be  safely  left 
outside the ‘global’ responsibility of the US.

‘Europe’  entered  Clinton’s  world  when  half-hearted  interventions  in  Somalia  and  Haiti 
in  1993  exposed  a  lack  of  determination  in  his  approach  and  drew  heavy  domestic 
criticism.  He  sought  to  counter  this  slump  by  revitalizing  the  Western  project  with 
European  friends, taking up an  invitation made by Kohl  already back in November  1992 
(Lundestad  1998:  124).  Visiting Europe for the first time in January  1994,  almost a year 
after his  inauguration,  Clinton  worked  hard  to  reassure  his  counterparts  of US  support 
for  European 
integration  (Clinton  1994;  Eizenstat  1994).  Yet  while  his  positive 
assessment of the EU as an economic partner carrying a liberal world order and his call 
for a new transatlantic security partnership “improved the atmosphere”,  his visit did not 
address  deeper  issues  (Smith  and  Woolcock  1994:  473f.;  Clinton  1994;  Lundestad 
1998).  Specifically, it was not accompanied by a shared reading of the conflict in Bosnia 
and did not lead to a significant US investment in the vision of a European Peace Order.

435  In  his  inaugural address  Clinton promised that “our hopes,  our hearts  and our hands are  with 
those  on  every  continent  who  are  building  democracy  and  freedom.  Their  cause  is  America’s 
cause”.

286

Germany:  *Europe* cannot End in Sarajevo

As  noted  earlier,  the  Kohl  government  had  intimately  linked  the  notion  of  unified 
Germany unfolding in a united Europe, claiming that Germany’s “European path” would 
be “without any alternative” (Kinkel  1992a). The debate on German responsibility in the 
wake of Iraq was considered “fundamental  for the future of our country and the part we 
want to play in  Europe” (Lamers  1991).  Such claims, voiced  parallel to the negotiations 
leading  to  the  Maastricht  Treaty,  were  possible  because  there  was  a  strong  sense  of 
shared  commitment  among  governments  of  EC  member  states  to  invest  in  a  ‘united 
Europe’.  Yet  it  was  still  necessary  to  concretize  this  vision  and,  by  doing  so,  the 
‘European path’.

One  of the  dominant  images  coming  out  of the  Maastricht  negotiations  was  that  of 
‘Europe’  as  a  pacifying  project,436  which  closely  resonated  with  the  narrative  of 
Germany in a European Peace Order. The Kohl government, together with  governments 
of other EC member states, took the conflict in Bosnia as an opportunity for manifesting 
the  commitment to  build  a  European  Peace  Order  by  framing  it  as  that  what  ‘Europe’ 
could  be  allowed  to  not  become.  Rather than  placing the  Balkans  outside  the  Western 
space,  the  conflict was  pictured  as  “the  return  of war  into the  heart  of Europe”  (Ruehe 
1994). And rather than viewing it as tragic yet local conflict which was inevitable due to 
unbridgeable  ethnic  divides  and  ancient  hatred  (the  US  version)  it  was  pictured  as  a 
challenge to the European Peace Order.  In other words, the fighting was integrated in the 
narrative  of  Germany-in-Europe  as  a  dystopia,  a  negative  vision  of  ‘Europe’  as  a 
fragmented  space.  This  image  also  was  formed  out  of the  memory  space  o f Europe’s 
conflictual  past,  yet  where  the  White  House  saw  a  conflict  limited  to  the  Balkans, 
German  policymakers  together  with  European  colleagues  magnified  the  conflict  into  a 
vision of European fragmentation  as a possibility to be prevented.  Mobilizing memories 
of the First World  War having been  ‘triggered’  in  Sarajevo,  the  view was nurtured  that, 
once  again,  the  Balkans  could  be  burying  the  prospect  of peace  in  Europe  raising  the 
possibility  of ‘Balkanization’  of the  European  space.437  The  dystopia  was  captured  by 
Claus Leggewie in the question “Does Europe end in Sarajevo?” (Leggewie  1993).

In Bonn the answer was a resounding ‘no’. Policymakers agreed that decisive action was

436  As  Christopher  Hill  (1998:  34)  has  shown,  following  Maastricht  the  EU  was  perceived  as 
potentially (1) a replacement for the USSR in the world balance of power, (2) a regional pacifier, 
(3) a global intervenor, (4) a mediator of conflicts, (5) a bridge between the rich and the poor and 
(6) a joint supervisor of the world economy.
437  The  1994  Whitebook  of the  Ministry  of  Defense  warned  that  “the  development  towards 
peaceful coexistence in the whole of Europe is not irreversible” (Weissbuch  1994: 23, 27, 30).

287

needed  to  “clarify  that  Europe  won’t  allow  its  values  to  be  ridiculed  in  this  manner” 
(Lowack  1994).  In  a  speech  to  the  Bundestag  in  January  1994,  Kohl  argued  that  the 
conflict demonstrated that the development of a European  Peace Order and the political 
unity  of  Europe  were  “more  important  than  ever”.  He  famously  claimed  that  “the 
question  of European  unity has  always  been  a  question  of war and  peace  (...)  The  fact 
that we can  look back on 48 years of peace...is partly the result of the ability of Europe 
to  come  together”  (Kohl  1994).  This  was  echoed  in  an  influential  position  paper 
published  by  the  CDU  caucus  in  September  1994,  during  the  German  EU  presidency, 
which  argued  that the  unity  of Europe  was  at risk.  And  “if Europe  were  to  drift  apart” 
the  paper  warned  it  would  be  “difficult  for  Germany  to  give  a  clear  orientation  to  its 
internal order” (Lamers  1994:  105).

In  short,  by  framing  it as  a warning what  ‘Germany-in-Europe’  could  become  if it  was 
not for integration, the Bosnian conflict served to strengthen the commitment to a vision 
of a  European  Peace Order with  EC  member states.  Just as  Adenauer had  used  ‘Korea’ 
to mobilize the dystopia of a communist Europe for manifesting German commitment to 
the  Western  space  of ‘freedom’,  now the  commitment to  idea  of ‘peace-through-unity’ 
was confirmed through the dystopia of Europe’s disintegration (Waever  1996;  1998).

Adjusting the German Narrative
As  discussed  in  Chapter  Six,  an  ontology  of authentic  becoming  holds  that  the  vision 
toward  which 
their  policies. 
Consequently,  Bonn’s framing of the Bosnian conflict as a commitment to the vision of 
a Greater European Peace Order also mandated a ‘peaceful’  solution to the conflict, that 
is,  it confirmed  the  superiority of civilian  means.  The  Kohl  government put significant 
effort 
into  mobilizing  EC/EU  diplomacy  and  devising  “a  new  form  of  crisis 
management”  through  a  strengthened  CSCE  (Genscher  1995:  320ff;  759f.).  Yet 
diplomatic efforts,  monitoring missions and  sanctions through  CSCE  and  EC/WEU  did 
not prevent the tensions from escalating, neither did UN conferences, the  ‘Vance-Owen’ 
diplomacy and  arms embargos against Belgrade. The CFSP  initiative by  Kinkel and  his 
French  counterpart  Juppe  in  November  1993  also  showed  no  significant  effect,  and 
Bonn’s hope for a diplomatic solution was laid to rest as UN  ‘peacekeepers’ were unable 
to  protect  declared  ‘safe  havens’  and  prevent  mass  killings  in  Srebrenica  in  July  1995 
(Hilz 2005: 255-256; Genscher  1995; Meiers 2006).

In  light  of these  developments,  the  Kohl  government had  to  push  for  a  change  of the 
German  narrative.  The  Gulf War  had  already  made  clear  that  military  means  had  not

288

been  banned  from  the  Western  project,  and  the  apparent  failure  of civilian  means  in 
bringing the  conflict  in  Bosnia to and  end  raised the  possibility of military  intervention 
there.  Given  its  investment  in  a  European  Peace  Order  and  its  commitment  to  avoid 
European  ‘fragmentation’ 
the  Kohl  government  could  not  ‘defect’  from  such  a 
possibility.  After  all,  under  the  German  presidency  the  WEU  had  in  June  1992 
committed  itself to engage  in  “humanitarian and  rescue tasks;  peacekeeping tasks;  tasks 
of  combat  forces 
the  so-called 
Petersberg  tasks  (Western  European  Union  1992).  The  problem  was  that  the  latter 
remained outside the horizons of the German narrative. Despite declaring the Balkans to 
be  at the  heart of Europe, they were  outside the territory of NATO  member states  and, 
thus, outside the space of possibility of military engagement in Germany’s world. To be 
able to support any kind of military engagement ‘out of area’  an adjustment of this space 
was required.

including  peacemaking”, 

in  crisis  management, 

In  March  1993  the  government introduced  a bill to clarify the  ‘casus  foederis’,  arguing 
that military missions  ‘abroad’  were to be allowed  under a UN  mandate without change 
of the  constitution  (Gutjahr  1994:  217).  In  a  landmark  decision,  the  Federal  Supreme 
Court  in  July  1994  confirmed  this  position.  The  Court  argued  that  a  lack  of German 
support  in  UN  missions  would  lead  to  a  loss  of confidence  in  its  Buendnisfaehigkeit 
among Western allies.  Referring to Article 24  of the Basic Law which  states that “With 
a view to maintaining peace, the Federation may enter into a system of mutual collective 
security”,  the  Court argued that  participation  in  ‘out  of area’  missions  was  in  harmony 
with  the  Basic  Law  as  long  as  these  missiond  took  place  within  the  framework  of 
‘systems  of  collective  security’  “strictly  bound  to  the  preservation  of  peace”  and 
approved  by  a  simple  majority  of the  Bundestag.  Importantly,  in  the  Court’s  view  the 
UN, CSCE, WEU and NATO all qualified as systems of collective security.438

While the ruling opened the  door to  significant changes,  doorstops were  put  in  place to 
ensure  it would  not  be  opened  too  widely.  In  addition  to  the  Court’s  insistence  on  the 
need  for parliamentary  approval,  the  government echoed  the  peace  ‘preserving’  aim  of 
any  Bundeswehr  activity  and  emphasized  that  military  force  remained  the  very  last 
resort  and  also  limited  the  spatial  horizon  of possible  out-of-area  engagements.  Kinkel

438 BVerfG: Urteil  12. Juli  1994, Pkt.  5b, reprinted in Stichworte zur Sicherheitspolitik, 7/1993, p. 
17.  While the Court was criticized for defining alliances such as NATO and WEU as systems of 
collective  security,  which  for  critics  was  reserved  for  UN  and  CSCE,  the  Court’s  view 
corresponds to the treatment of these organisations in this thesis. However the debate can be seen 
as  reflecting  domestic  differences  about  which  institution  was  most  appropriate  for  embedding 
Germany’s  ontological  security.  See  also  Meiers  (2006:  274-277).  For  a  detailed  legal-political 
analysis o f ‘systems of collective security’, see Jaberg (1996).

assured that “normalcy in  foreign and security policy does not mean to act as the worlds 
policeman,  it does not mean to send German soldiers to all the burning spots worldwide” 
(Kinkel  1994b). The  1994 Whitebook of the Ministry of Defense stated the primary goal 
of security  policy  to  be  “the  political  formation  [Gestaltmg]  of peace  in  the  near  and 
expanded  periphery  of  Germany”  (Weissbuch  1994:  43;  Ruehe,  1995),  and  Kohl 
declared that the Bundeswehr would  not get involved  in territories which  had  once been 
occupied by the  Wehrmacht.  In other words, there were limits to support for ‘out of area’ 
missions  if the  ‘Civilian  Power’  narrative  of Germany-in-Europe  was  to  maintain  its 
authenticity.

The  adaptation  of  Germany’s  national  biography  was  practically  manifested  in  the 
support of NATO’s air-campaign  in Bosnia in June  1995  with non-combat forces439 and 
occured  on the back of a tense  and well-documented domestic debate.440 The  coherence 
of the  narrative  was  maintained  by  arguing  that  the  German  memory  space  generated 
two  lessons, namely the moral maxim ‘never again genocide’  and  ‘never again war’, and 
that  if the  two  were  in  conflict the  former trumped the  latter.  This  re interpretation  was 
made possible,  first,  because  it was  inscribed  into the utopia of a European  Peace Order 
emphasising  ‘unity’  and  supported  by  the  dystopia  of the  disintegration  of the  value 
space  of  ‘Europe’,  with  Joschka  Fischer  of  the  Green  Party  famously  arguing  that 
pacifists  could  not  accept “the  new  form  of fascism”  he  saw  in  Bosnia  (Fischer  1995). 
Thus, as with Adenauer, a dystopia was used to generate significant changes to the anti­
militarism  of the  German  narrative.  Second,  as  suggested  by  the  friendship  lens,  the 
government argued  that  the  change  was  necessary  because  core  partners  committed  to 
the  same  vision  expected  Germany  to  adopt  this  new  stance.  As  Kinkel  argued,  the 
‘culture of restraint’ was not acceptable to Western friends who had liberated  ‘Germany’ 
in  1945  and  who now  expected  Germans to “actively contribute towards the  protection 
of  the  international  order...especially  in  Europe”  (Kinkel  1994a).  Yet,  again,  the 
government made clear there were  limits  to  maintain  the  coherence  of the  biographical 
narrative.  The  use  of force  was  to  be  a  ‘last  resort’  if all  else  had  failed.  As  Kinkel 
stressed,  “especially  we  Germans  want  to  hold  on  to  the  culture  of  non-violence, 
dialogue, and the readiness to compromise” (Kinkel  1994a).

The  crucial  point  for  the  present  argument  is  that  this  adjustment  of  the  German 
narrative  did  not  occur  primarily  with  the  US  and  within  NATO.  Instead,  the  Kohl

government  embedded  the  redefinition  of  German  ‘responsibility’ 
in  foreign  and 
security policy in the project of European integration (Kreile  1996). This must be looked 
at more closely.

Estrangement: Doubts about NATO/US
The  US  did  not  appear  as  the  most  attractive  partner  and  NATO  not  the  most  suitable 
institution  in  which this  adjustment of the  German narrative could  be  safely  negotiated. 
Washington’s  hesitancy  to  get  involved  in  Bosnia  had  already  cast  doubt  over  its 
commitment to a Greater European  Peace Order and this doubt was confirmed when the 
US became involved more actively.

In  1995  the  Clinton  administration  shifted  course  and  declared  the  conflict  in  Bosnia  a 
Western  matter that could only be solved with US  leadership through NATO.  Suddenly 
the  Balkans  became a symbol  for “Europe’s  freedom  and  Europe’s  stability”  and  “vital 
to  our  own  national  security”  (Clinton  1995  in  Hansen  1995g).  As  Hansen  points  out, 
this  shift  in  the  American  narrative  was  made  possible  by  replacing  the  image  of  a 
localised  conflict  at the  margins  of Europe  beset  by  ‘ancient  hatred’  with  an  image  of 
‘genocide’  occurring  at  the  heart  of Europe  and  within  a  multi-ethnic  Western  space 
(Hansen  2006:  140-144).  Although  in this aspect Clinton’s narrative connected with the 
German  reading,  the  shift  did  not  reflect  a  commitment  for  the  same  project.  The 
American  incorporation  of the  Balkans  into the  Western  space  and through NATO was 
not  the  same  as  investing  in  the  vision  of a  European  Peace  Order.  While  before  his 
administration  had  effectively  vetoed  European  diplomatic  initiatives,441  Clinton  now 
claimed that the  US  needed to take on  the  responsibility of leadership  because “Europe 
alone could not end the conflict” and it was necessary to bring in America as “freedom’s 
greatest  champion”.  In  a  Newsweek  article  entitled  Why Bosnia  Matters  To  America, 
Clinton justified US engagement as necessary not only to end human suffering and build 
a  peaceful  Europe,  but  also  to  maintain  NATO’s  status  as  the  dominant  institution  for 
ordering  Europe:  “If the  US  does  not  do  its  part  in  a NATO  mission...we  would  also 
weaken  NATO  -  the  anchor  of America’s  and  Europe’s  security -   and jeopardize  US 
leadership in Europe” (Clinton  1995b).

The  problem was that in doing  ‘its  part’  in the NATO mission the US was not engaging 
in shared world building. The memory of Vietnam, revived by the debacle  in Somalia in

441  Bonn was  frustrated by  US rejection of the  Vance-Owen  Peace  Plan,  the  lack of US  support 
for the EU  Action  Plan  and that in  May  1993  it excluded Germany  from the talks producing an 
alternative Joint Action Programme (Owen  1995:  179).

291

it 

October  1993,  remained  too  powerful  and  made 
impossible  for  the  Clinton 
administration to commit to ground troops. Instead, it continued to press for a strategy of 
‘lift  (the  sanctions)  and  strike  (from  the  air)’,  a  practice  opposed  by  European  NATO 
allies  who  wanted  to  uphold  sanctions  and  strengthen  the  UN  troops  stationed  on  the 
ground  (Owen  1995;  Hansen  2006).  When  Washington  got  its  way, NATO  allies  were 
sidelined  in  the  planning  and  conduct  of combat  operations,  as  well  as  in  the  peace 
negotiations  leading to the Dayton agreement. Resentment about US dominance -  of not 
being  treated  as  an  equal  -   transpired  also  into  German  criticism  of  how  the  US 
approached  the  peace-building  task,  such  as  its  rejection  of UN  oversight  of civilian 
relief efforts  in coordination with  peacekeepers and  its plans to rearm the  Bosnian  army 
(Whitney,  1995).442

In  short,  the  Bosnia experience  confirmed what  had  been  become apparent  in  the  Gulf 
War, namely that despite Clinton’s charm offensive  in  1994 the American  narrative had 
moved  the  Western  project  away  from  the  vision  of a  Greater  European  Peace  Order. 
This  turned  the  American  claim  for  leadership  through  NATO  into  a  problem.  US 
passivity  had  prevented the  institution  from  taking  a  more  active  role  early  on  and  the 
sidelining  of  Allies  during  the  operation,  stretching  into  the  post-conflict  stage,  had 
exposed the  limits of US  willingness to work together.  Given the Court’s  ‘door opener’ 
mentioned earlier,  this  raised  the  concern  in  Bonn that the  US  path  of action  might not 
come to  support the  vision  of a  European  Peace  Order through  which  the  ‘out of area’ 
adjustment  had  been  justified.  In  other  words,  the  government  might  sign  off  on  a 
NATO  mission  whose  conduct  and  consequences  come  to  violate  domestic  values.  In 
crude terms, the  relationship with  the  US  within  NATO  had  become a generator rather 
than a controlling mechanism of German anxiety.443

Emancipation: Investment in CFSP/France
As  for  the  alternatives,  the  high  hopes  for  CSCE  as  a  forum  for  building  a  Greater 
European  Peace  Order  had  not  been  fulfilled.  Formally  Bonn  continued  to  support 
CSCE,  most notably by turning it into an actual organisation (OSCE), yet US disinterest 
in  the  institution  and  its  apparent  ineffectiveness  in  ‘managing’  the  Bosnian  conflict 
diminished  its value considerably for negotiating German authentic becoming.

442  The  US  oversaw  NATO’s  Implementation  Force  to  which  Bonn  contributed  4,000  troops 
(Schake  1998).
443  Scholars have identified this  in more traditional  ‘alliance’ terminology as a German/European 
fear of entrapment (Press-Bamathan 2006; Hilz 2005).

292

While  Bosnia  had  also  exposed  what  Christopher  Hill  (1993)  famously  called  the 
“capability-expectations  gap”  of  CFSP,  building  an  alternative  through  the  EU  with 
France  as  the  creative  partner  appeared  the  most  promising  option.  Already  during 
Germany’s  1994  EU  presidency  a  consensus  formed  in  the  government  that  it  was 
necessary to give ‘face and voice’ to CFSP. The  1994 coalition treaty and the subsequent 
Bundestag  address  of  the  re-elected  Kohl  government  voiced  support  for  the 
development  of  an  independent  European  security  and  defence  identity  (Bundestag 
1994c).  Four  of the  five  central  security  objectives  listed  in  the  Whitebook  explicitly 
linked German  security to European  integration, with only one  stressing the  importance 
of  the  transatlantic  alliance  “because  the  global  power  of  the  United  States 
is 
indispensable  for  international  stability”  before  in  a  separate  point  calling  for  the 
creation  of a “new security  order encompassing all  European  states”  (Whitebook  1994: 
42).

The  aforementioned  CDU  position  paper called  for closer cooperation  with  France  and 
the  deepening of European  integration  by  “raising the  Franco-German relationship to  a 
new  level”.  It  suggested  creating  a  French-German  “hard  core”  and  in  improving 
CFSP’s  capacity  for  “effective  action”,  explicitly  noting  that  this  would  constitute  an 
“indispensable  factor  in  endowing the  EU  [read:  Germany]  with  an  identity of its own” 
(Lamers  1994:  113).  The  paper  even  went  so  far  as  suggesting  that  “the  USA  can  no 
longer play  its traditional role” and that Germany’s relations with France were now “the 
yardstick by which to measure its sense of belonging to the West’s community of shared 
political  and  cultural  values”  (Ibid.,  112).  This  was  accompanied  by  a  number of high 
level  affirmations of the  French-German  ‘special  relationship’  in  the  Summer of  1994, 
symbolized  in  the  participation  of  German  Eurocorps  units  in  the  14  July  parade  in 
Paris. The sincerity of this shift towards France was also indicated by the concern among 
Atlanticists that the Kohl  government was undermining the Germany’s Western  identity 
and even  ‘the West’ as such.444

To  be  sure,  this  move  did  not  involve  a  denouncement  of  the  German-American 
relationship  or  of German  commitment to  NATO.  Emancipation  is  a  painful  and  slow 
process and among conservatives, in particular, the Atlantic Alliance continued to enjoy 
high support (Leggewie  1993:  20;  Schaeuble  1994). Kohl did not stop calling NATO the 
“security anchor” and  “bedrock”  of Europe’s security architecture  (Duffield  1998:  118)

444  See  Weissmann  (1994);  Gillessen  (1994);  Diner  (1994);  Baring  (1994).  Similar  voices  are 
found  among conservatives  in  the  US  (Gompert  1997).  For debates between  ‘Europeanists’  and 
‘Atlanticists’ over what role the US could/should (not) play in  Europe, see Weidenfeld (1996).

293

and  liked  to  claim  that  ‘Germany’  was  equally  committed to  relationships  with  the  US 
and  with France, always courting both as  ‘core allies’.445 Along the same times, German 
officials  always  assured  that  their  institutional  commitments  in  the  EU  and  in  NATO 
were complementary. Again, Kennedy’s metaphor of the two pillars proved particularly 
helpful  here.  Policymakers  in  Bonn  and  Washington  could  agree  about the  idea  of the 
WEU  as  the  ‘European  pillar’  of  NATO  and  put  in  place  various  rhetorical  and 
institutional  links between the two. These bridges always seemed to uphold the primacy 
of NATO,  such  as  in  the  Combined Joint  Task  Forces  (CJTF),  which  would  make 
“collective  assets”  available  for  WEU  operations  “on  the  basis  of consultations  in  the 
North  Atlantic  Council”  (NATO  1994,  Sect.  6)  and  the  earlier  mentioned  idea  of a 
European Security and Defence Identity within NATO,  supported  by Clinton during his 
1994 visit and confirmed at the  1996 Berlin summit.

The key problem (or appeal) with the ‘pillar’  metaphor was that the question what ‘roof 
the  European  pillar was carrying was ultimately left open:  was  it NATO,  or was NATO 
the  second pillar? And  if WEU/CFSP and NATO were two pillars standing next to each 
other, what roof were they carrying? This was the question of the common project.  And 
from that angle, the  issue was  not one  of complementarity between  institutions  but one 
of resonance among significant others about visions of European order. And so it was  in 
an  attempt  to  improve  the  latter  that  Bonn  continued  to  cooperate  with  France  to 
enhance  WEU  capabilities  and  integrate  them  into  the  EU,  as  in  a  French-German 
‘Common  Security  and  Defense  Concept’  from  December  1996  and  during  the 
following  Intergovernmental Conference  in Amsterdam  (Jopp  and  Schmuck  1996;  Hilz 
2005:  163-179; Meiers 2006:  1138-156).

Conclusion
This chapter assessed the argument that German  investment in CFSP was a reaction to a 
process  of  estrangement  in  German-American  relations.  It  provided  evidence  for 
enduring  dissonance  between  German  and  American  narratives  of  being-in-the-world 
which rendered NATO unsuitable as a forum through which to negotiate a shared project 
in which an authentic German narrative could be embedded and provided a rationale for 
creating an alternative.

445  See Duffield (1998); Hilz (2005); Meiers (2006).  Kohl’s comment to US Ambassador Robert 
Kimmitt that while  France  was  Germany’s  ‘closest’  ally  he  considered  America to  be  its  ‘most 
important’ ally is exemplary (Bering  1999: 45).

294

Continuing a trend  started  by  Kissinger (see  chapter nine),  this  chapter  showed  lacking 
support for the vision of a united Europe as envisioned by Germany among all  three US 
administrations  (Reagan,  Bush,  Clinton).  The  view  that  such  a  ‘Europe’  did  not 
contribute to America’s narrative as the leader of the Western world was strongest under 
Reagan  and  ambiguous  under  Bush.  The  chapter  showed  that  German  unease  with 
Reagan  was  alleviated  by  Kohl’s  commitment to  the  friendship  and  by  his  strategy  of 
‘normalization’  and  that  the  ‘Bonn-Washington’  nexus  over  the  issue  of  German 
unification  disrupted 
the  surface.  The  close 
cooperation  between  Bush  and  Kohl  was  merely hiding the  dissonance  by  blending out 
the question of how to order ‘Europe’  and how a united Germany would be integrated in 
the  Western  project.  While  both  sides  thus  considered  the  relationship  as  a  creative 
source  for  building  a  post-Cold  War world,  by  blending  out the  parameters which  had 
nurtured  the  estrangement  process  the  Bonn-Washington’  nexus  gave  the  misleading 
impression  that their horizons  of expectations were  aligned  when  in  fact they were  not. 
As such, the collaboration over German unification raised false expectations.

the  estrangement  process  only  on 

It  was  demonstrated  that  the  dissonance  resurfaced  in  interpretations  of the  1990  Iraq 
invasion of Kuwait and the conflict in Bosnia. Different view of what these events meant 
for  the  Western  project  and,  correspondingly,  how  to  respond  to  them  revealed  that 
horizons  of  expectations  were  not  aligned.  The  Gulf  War  challenged  the  German 
narrative  in  positing  that  the  global  projection  of  military  force  was  considered  an 
acceptable  part  of the  Western  project,  exerting  pressure  on  the  Kohl  government  to 
adjust.  The  German  reading  of  the  conflict  in  Bosnia  as  a  confirmation  of  its 
commitment to  a  Greater  European  Peace  Order  and,  by  contrast,  the  American  view 
that  Bosnia  was  situated  outside  the  Western  space  and  its  hesitancy  to  get  involved 
further  confirmed  the  dissonance.  American  leadership  in  building  Western  order 
through  NATO t hus  generated  anxiety  in  Bonn  and  rendered  the  Atlantic  Alliance 
unsuitable  for  adjusting the  German  narrative  and  ‘opening  the  door’  to  ‘out  of area’ 
missions.  Hence,  the  chapter suggested that the  Kohl  government pursued  a strategy of 
emancipation  by  turning  to  France  as  that  friend  with  whom  it  could  invest  in 
(W)EU/CFSP  as  an  alternative  forum  for  negotiating  a  project  which  required  less 
compromise to the authenticity of the German narrative.

CHAPTER ELEVEN: CONCLUSION

This thesis has attempted to assess, conceptually and empirically, the motives behind the 
emergence  and  the  decline  of  interstate  security  cooperation,  defined  as  the  costly 
investment  in  a  common  international  institution  and  applied  to  German-American 
relations  between  1945  and  1995. 
It  took  as  its  starting  point  Germany’s  subsequent 
investment in three different security  institutions  for the  purpose  of ‘European  security’ 
which  over  time  came  to  exclude  the  United  States,  namely  (what  became)  NATO, 
CSCE  and  CFSP.  This  investment was  framed  as  a  phenomenon  of German-American 
security  cooperation  moving  from  ‘consensus’  (1945-55)  via  ‘tension’  (1965-75)  to 
‘divergence’  (1985-95).  When the  logical thrust of the three main IR theories -  realism, 
institutionalism  and  constructivism  -   were  shown  to  be  unable  to  provide  a  coherent 
explanation  for  this  dynamic,  the  phenomenon  turned  into  a  puzzle  (chapter  one). 
Against  this  backdrop,  the  thesis  attempted  to  build  a  new  theoretical  argument  for 
explaining  interstate  security cooperation  and  apply  it to the  historical  case of German- 
American  cooperation.  Below  I  briefly  summarize the  argument and  highlight some of 
the  contributions  to  IR theory  and  to  our  understanding  of German-American  security 
cooperation.

Argument
in  this  thesis  was  that  states  invest  in  common 
The  basic  argument  advanced 
international  institutions to pursue  a shared project of ‘world building’.  More precisely, 
it  was  suggested  that  (1)  states  are  driven  by  the  aim  to  control  anxiety  through  the 
formulation of a meaningful narrative of (coming into)  ‘being-in-the-world’  and that (2) 
the formulation and  practical  maintenance of such  an authentic biographical  narrative  is 
pursued  with  states  regarded  as  friends.  It  was  further  argued  that  (3)  enduring 
dissonance  between  friends  about  visions  of order  signifies  a  process  of estrangement 
which  brings  ambiguity  in  the  biographical  narrative  and  undermines  the  friendship’s 
ability  to  control  anxiety.  And  if  states  cannot  reduce  this  dissonance  (4)  they  will 
pursue a strategy of emancipation by seeking new friends with whom they can  invest in 
an  alternative/new 
to  pursue  a  world  building  project  which  better 
accommodates their understanding of meaningful becoming. Using this theoretical  lens, 
the dynamic of German-American cooperation  was  captured  as  moving from  friendship 
(consensus)  to  estrangement (tensions)  and,  eventually,  emancipation  (divergence)  and 
explained  with  (dis)agreements  among  political  leaders  over  visions  of  a  peaceful 
European order and its place in respective national biographies.

institution 

297

I  explored this  argument empirically beginning with  chapter eight,  which  examined the 
shared  commitment to NATO  in the post-war decade  (1945-55).  It was  argued  that the 
German-American consensus of NATO  as  the  security  institution  for ordering  ‘Europe’ 
rested  on  the  agreement  of  a  shared  project  of  ‘world  building’  in  which  respective 
national  biographies  -   narratives  of  authentic  becoming  -   were  embedded.  More 
precisely,  the  chapter  showed  that  policymakers  in  Bonn  and  in  Washington,  in  their 
attempt  to  meaningfully  inscribe  ‘being-in-Europe’  in  respective  national  biographies, 
came to share the vision of a ‘United States of Europe’ marked by ‘freedom’  and  ‘unity’. 
This  shared  vision  generated  commitment  to  building  such  a  ‘Europe’  in  the  Western 
space through NATO,  a project  in which the US was willing to regard  ‘Germany’  as an 
equal  partner and Adenauer could reciprocate by pushing for rearmament. It was shown 
that against French opposition and buttressed by the dystopia of a communist Germany- 
in-Europe,  Adenauer  and  US  administrations  under  Truman  and  Eisenhower  worked 
closely together to bring the FRG into NATO.

While  both  sides  remained committed  to the value  of ‘freedom’,  chapters  nine  and  ten 
suggested  that  a  gradual  withdrawal  of  US  commitment  to  the  vision  of  a  ‘united’ 
Europe  came  into  conflict with  a growing  German vision  of a Greater  European  Peace 
Order,  leading  to  (dis)agreements  about  the  suitability  of NATO  for  negotiating  their 
respective  national  biographies  of ‘Germany’  and  ‘America’  in  the  world.  Specifically, 
the analysis of the second period (1965-1975) developed  in  chapter nine  highlighted the 
dissonance  between  Brandt’s  and  Kissinger/Nixon’s  conception  of a peaceful  ‘Europe’, 
with the  former pursuing a transformative  and  the  latter a  static/conservative  vision.  In 
an effort to maintain the friendship and, thus, the commitment to build the West through 
NATO,  this  dissonance  and  the  sense  of lacking  reciprocity  was  muted  by  silence  on 
contentious  issues,  such  as  Vietnam,  by  channelling  diverging  paths  through  NATO’s 
emphasis on detente, and by an American approach of ‘indifference’ to Brandt’s attempt 
to pursue the vision of Germany-in-(Greater)Europe through CSCE.

Finally,  chapter  ten  examined  German-American  dissonance  about  the  meaning  and 
desirability of a ‘united Europe’  in the Western project period surrounding the end of the 
Cold  War  (1985-95).  It  was  argued  that  tensions  were  visible  during  the  Reagan 
administration  and  that  close  cooperation  between  Kohl  and  the  Bush  administration 
over  German  unification  misled  both  sides  in  assuming  that  horizons  of expectations 
were  now  aligned.  The  chapter  showed  that  dissonance  was  exposed  in  disagreements 
over how to  integrate the  1990  Iraq  invasion  of Kuwait  and  the  conflict  in  Bosnia  into

298

the  Western  project.  Whereas  US  administrations  expected  unified  Germany to  support 
the  widening  of the  Western  space  in  a  post-Cold  War  world,  the  Kohl  government 
feared  a direction which did  not contribute to the building of a Greater European  Peace 
Order  and  could  not  accommodate  the  anti-militarism  principle, 
thus  alienating 
‘Germany’  from  its authentic post-45  narrative.  This led the Kohl  government to invest, 
via the WEU, in CFSP.

Contributions
The  first  contribution  the  thesis  makes  is  that  it  offers  a  strategy  for  how  to  build  a 
theory (of interstate  security cooperation).  It puts  forward  the  notion  of a  ‘deep theory’ 
as a causal  narrative starting on the  level of ontology which  anchors the meaning of the 
state  and  its  ‘national  security  interest’  in  an  account  of the  human  condition  (chapter 
two).  It  suggests  that  this  offers  a  new  way  to  understand  the  meaning  of a  ‘common 
security  interest’  as  one  of  sustaining  a  shared  project  which  enables  authentic 
becoming.  In this context, the thesis suggests an approach o f ‘creative theorizing’ taking 
place  in  two  steps:  (i)  the  unravelling  of  existing  paradigms  in  IR  for  discerning 
conceptual  openings,  in  this  case  realism,  institutionalism  and  constructivism,  which 
then are engaged by (ii) drawing on philosophical insights, in this case making particular 
use  of Heidegger and  Aristotle.446  Even  if the  result  is  still  more  a conceptual  skeleton 
than  a  fully  fledged  theory,  I  suggest  the  discussion  redirects  thinking  about  interstate 
(German-American) relations in a number of ways.

First, reading the human condition with  Heidegger points to anxiety as the  foundational 
sentiment  of  ‘being-in-the-world’  (chapter  four),  which  offers  an  alternative  to  the 
Hobbesian  reading  that  humans  react  to  uncertainty  with  fear.  It  builds  on  the 
phenomenological  insight  that  one  cannot  have  an  experience  of  death  and,  hence, 
cannot  have  knowledge  about  what  to  fear  to  suggest  that  the  unknowability  of the 
future  makes the  Self anxious,  not  fearful.  While  the  empirical  discussion  outlined  the 
anxiety-raising  conditions  among  policymakers, the  ‘Potsdam  complex’  in  the  German 
case  and the  ‘Rapallo  complex’  in the American  case (see,  in  particular,  chapter eight), 
anxiety is a feeling and  difficult to record.  One can trace  its effects,  however, by paying 
attention to the  strategies employed by the  Self to control  anxiety and, thus,  understand 
the  ‘national  interest’  as the formulation  of a coherent and  authentic national  biography 
(e.g., Williams 2005).

446 Again, the  fact that these two thinkers  inspired the argument at crucial  stages does not mean 
that it intends or pretends to be a Heideggerian or an Aristotelian theory of IR.

the  “next  step 

Second,  by  advancing  a  dynamic  ontology  of ‘the  state’  as  something  that  unfolds  in 
time  and  space,  the  thesis  offers  an  alternative  to  the  static  and  exclusive  ontology  of 
states  associated  with  Hobbesian  ontology.  It  contributes  to 
in 
Constructivist  IR  Theory”  by  ‘endogenizing’  the  analysis  of state  identity  (Cedermann 
and  Daase 2003),  although this  step remains one  in the direction Onuf (1989) originally 
laid  out,  namely 
‘world  of  our  making’.  More  precisely,  my 
conceptualization  of  the  state  as  a  narrative  of  ‘authentic  becoming’  defining  its 
existence  through  a  coherent  national  biography  (chapter  five)  suggests  a re-reading of 
the  spatio-temporal  configuration  of ‘the  state’.  It  stresses  the  notion  of an  experienced 
space,  a  meaningful  environment  reaching  beyond  Westphalian  boundaries  and 
encompassing that  ‘world’  which  has  gained  meaning and  become  ‘known’  (disclosed) 
through  significant  experience.  The  philosophical  grounding  of the  need  for  historical 
analogies and visions as anxiety controlling mechanisms directs attention to the temporal 
ordering  of this  space  by  pointing  to  the  creative  act  of transforming  memories  into 
meaningful  visions  lending  direction  to  unfolding.  It  highlights  the  importance  of 
memoiy  and  visions as  politically contested existentials  in  the  sense  of manifesting the 
existence of ‘the state’  in a national biography.

The  existential  reading of the  state as  a national  biography directs attention to a certain 
reading  of  what  drives  the  security  policy  of  governments.  Rather  than  focusing  on 
survival  understood  as  the  maintenance  of territorial  integrity,  the  thesis  supports  the 
argument  that  states  strive  for  ‘ontological  security’  (e.g.,  Mitzen  2006).  That  said,  it 
goes  beyond  the  Giddensian  focus  on  ‘routine  practices’  by  emphasizing the  desire  for 
authenticity which,  it was  argued,  cannot  be  satisfied  by  routines  (chapter four).  In this 
current,  the  argument  that  governments  are  primarily  concerned  with  formulating  a 
coherent  narrative  of,  for  instance,  ‘Germany’  situated  in  space  and  time  offers  an 
alternative  to  the  argument  advanced  by  Haftendom  (1984)  that  ‘unity’  and  ‘security’ 
were  conflicting  goals  for  German  policymakers  during  the  Cold  War.  The  theoretical 
lens  used  here  suggests these  two  goals  did  not  stand  in  conflict  because  policymakers 
were  concerned  primarily  with  safeguarding  a  vision  of a  particular  ‘Germany’  and,  as 
such, a particular ‘unity’.

By  emphasizing  the  ontological  importance  of the  experienced/envisioned  space,  the 
thesis also provides a new angle for assessing the importance of spatial metaphors,  such 
as  ‘Europe’  and  ‘the  West’,  within  narratives  of  the  state.  It  supports  the  task  of

300

‘Europeanizing’  and  ‘Westernizing’  the  history  of both  Germany  and  America447  and, 
correspondingly, suggests that analysts should take seriously how policymakers envision 
the future of ‘European’  and/or ‘Western’  order and how these are embedded in national 
biographies (e.g., Banchoff 1999; Jackson 2006).  In this context, the thesis also suggests 
that the vision  of a desirable  order (utopia)  may be  complemented by  a negative vision 
(dystopias),  as  in Adenauer’s  ‘Korea’  and  ‘Prague’  scenarios (chapter eight) and Kohl’s 
‘fragmentation’  or  ‘Balkanization’  scenarios  (chapter ten).  Here the  empirical  narrative 
suggested something not anticipated by the theoretical discussion, namely that dystopias 
are  mobilised  not  merely  to  highlight  which  paths  not  to  pursue,  but  for justifying 
significant  adjustments  of the  biographical  narrative,  in  this  case  to  allow  for  German 
rearmament and participation  in ‘out of area’  missions, respectively.

Third,  the  thesis  offers  a  substantial  reading  of  interstate  relations  as  ‘friendship’, 
conceptualized  as  an  overlap  of national  biographies  embedded  in  a  shared  project  of 
‘world  building’  (chapter  six).  It  does  so  by  directing  attention  to  the  inter-subjective 
dimension  of  authentic  becoming  to  argue  that  a  coherent  biographical  narrative  is 
achieved  with  a  significant  Other.  The  focus  on  friendship  as  a  particular  relationship 
reconciles the social dimension of conceptions of Selfhood with the need for ‘substance’ 
(or authenticity) and,  more broadly speaking, thereby offers an  answer to the  ‘structure- 
agency’  dilemma  and 
to  the  ‘constructivist-essentialist’  debate.  Furthermore,  by 
suggesting  that  states  seek  friends  to  control  their  anxiety,  the  thesis  shifts  the  focus 
away  not only  from the  ‘collective’  but  also  from  the  ‘enemy’  as that through  which  a 
sense  of Self is  stabilized.  By  offering  a  reading  of security  interdependence  between 
Germany  and  the  US  as  internally  conditioned  and  sustained  through  friendship,  this 
thesis  substantiates  the  notion  that  German-American  security  cooperation  is  internally 
organised around shared values (e.g., Risse-Kappen  1995) and highlights the  importance 
of a common spatial orientation,  in this case the overlapping commitment to a particular 
order o f ‘Europe’  in ‘the West’.

Fourth,  the  friendship  lens  also  offers  a  certain  reading  of institutions  (chapter  six).  In 
contrast to the reading of institutions as either neutral  ‘information providers’  (utilitarian 
institutionalism),  or  active  ‘socializing  agents’  (moderate  constructivism),  it  conceives 
of international  institutions as sites for friends to negotiate their common world building

447 As historians recently pointed out the  ‘Europeanization’  of Germany occurred long before the 
framework  of European  integration  was  established  (Fervert  2005:  11;  Blackburn  2005).  The 
spatial  conception  of  ‘America’  requires  even  more  rethinking,  as  despite  the  debate  about 
American  ‘empire’  the  US  is  still  read  as  a  representative  of the  classic  notion  of sovereignty 
(Keohane 2002).

301

project  in  both  deliberation  (discourse)  and  activities  (practice).  This  is  not to  suggest 
that all  members in  international  institutions are friends but, rather, that they are used by 
friends  to  order the  experienced  space  and  invest  in  a  shared  vision  of what this  space 
should  be.  Other  members  of the  institution  may  or  may  not  support  this  project,  and 
they also may want to use the institution for a different project.

Fifth,  by discussing causes for the dissolution  of friendships,  the causal  narrative fills  a 
gap  in  the  constructivist'  literature  whose  socialization  bias  has,  so  far,  prevented 
scholars  from  discussing  why  and  how  social  relations  deteriorate  (chapter  seven).  In 
this  context,  the  discussion  of  the  estrangement  process  also  tackled  the  neglected 
question  of  how  ‘identities’  are  threatened  in  their  existence.  It  was  suggested  that 
‘ambivalence’  threatens the  stable  sense  of Self and that,  from  a friendship perspective, 
the existential threat to the same emerged from within the  significant relationship rather 
than  from  without.  This,  it  was  argued,  is  the  logical  consequence  of the  process  of 
mutual  empowerment  among  friends  which  generates  existential  interdependence  and, 
thus,  mutual  vulnerability.  By  bringing  in  ‘the  stranger’,  the  thesis  contributes  to  the 
increasing recognition  among constructivists that  it  is necessary to go beyond the  ‘Self- 
Other’  binary  (with  the  Other  mainly  understood  as  the  enemy)  and,  thus,  expand  the 
range  of ‘Otherness’  in  IR’s  analytical  toolkit  (e.g.,  Huysmans  1998a;  Rumelili  2004; 
Diez 2005).

Sixth,  the  friendship  lens  enhances  the  understanding  of  ‘power’ 
in  international 
relations  (Barnett  and  Duvall  2005;  Berenskoetter  and  Williams  2007).  It  does  so  by 
highlighting  two  power  phenomena  in  the  process  of  shared  world  building  which 
significantly differ from the conventional  (neo)realist reading:  It was argued that central 
to  friendship  is (i)  a process of mutual  empowerment lending direction  and resolve  and 
to  each  others’  unfolding and  that within  this  process  friends  not only  enable  authentic 
becoming  but,  inevitably,  also  (ii)  exert  reciprocal  ‘soft’  power  over  each  other  by 
requiring adaptation of respective national biographies (chapter six and seven)

This  angle  shines  a  light on  the  German-American  relationship  which  is  different from 
that of ‘great power competition’  and supports the scholarly agenda of viewing Germany 
as  a  player  rather  than  a  playground  (Banchoff  1999;  Weber  and  Kowert  2007).  It 
suggests that figures  like Adenauer,  Brandt and  Kohl  possessed  a  ‘soft power’  resource 
and,  thus,  agency  in  shaping the  Western  project.  Specifically,  by offering a reading of 
the Adenauer government as a creative force  in the making of the  ‘Germany-in-Europe’ 
narrative  (chapter  eight),  the  thesis  offers  a  correction  to  the  understanding  that  “the

302

founding  of  the  Federal  Republic...was  a  decision  of  the  Western  allies  and  a 
consequence of the cold war” (Haftendom,  1985:  2) and, by extension, to the reading of 
German politics as passively reacting to the East-West conflict.  Similarly, the discussion 
suggests  that  Brandt’s  vision  for  embedding  ‘Germany’  in  a  Greater  European  Peace 
Order  (chapter  nine)  nudged  the  Western  project  into  a  new  direction  and  into  a  new 
forum (CSCE).  Finally, the Kohl/Genscher government demonstrated agency no only  in 
negotiating  German  unification  but  also  in  pursuing  a  vision  of  Germany-in-Europe 
which,  when  US  support  was  lacking,  successfully  tapped  into  long-standing  French 
plans to establish an alternative to NATO.

Taking  a  look  at  the  overall  dynamic,  the  empirical  discussion  generated  two  further 
notable  findings:  First,  in  both  the  first  and  the  third  period  the  WEU  provided  a 
bridging  function  for  channelling  German  ambitions  to  invest  in  NATO  and  CFSP, 
respectively.  Moreover,  as  noted  earlier,  dystopias  were  used  by  both  Adenauer  and 
Kohl  to  justify  significant  adjustments  of  the  anti-militarism  principle  and  confirm 
German  commitment to,  and  manifest  its voice  in, these  institutions.  Second,  while the 
Bosnian conflict exposed the  inadequacy of CSCE as a forum for negotiating a Germany 
in  a Greater European  Peace  Order,  its  replacement by CFSP  for pursuing this aim  was 
neither radical  nor entirely surprising. As noted  in chapter nine, the  institutional embryo 
of CFSP,  EPC,  was founded  in  the context of and  proved  successful  in the  negotiations 
leading  to  the  Helsinki  Final  Act.  As  such,  in  design  and  purpose  CFSP  must  be  seen 
less  a  late  fulfilment  of  EDC  (see  chapter  eight)  but,  rather,  as  an  institution  which 
comes closer to Bahr’s  1968  ‘third version’  of a European System of Collective Security 
(see chapter nine).

Looking Ahead
The  expansion  of  the  ‘data  base’  provides  important  insights  for  understanding  the 
opportunities and limits of contemporary US-German security cooperation, aided by that 
the  analysis  resisted the  temptation  of rigidly  separating the  ‘Cold  War’  and  the  ‘post- 
Cold  War’  period  (see  chapter  ten).  Instead,  by  interpreting  tensions  between  (now) 
Berlin and Washington as growing out of a conflict between German plans for unfolding 
in  ‘Europe’  and American vision of the Western project, this thesis points to roots which 
lie much deeper than the question of whether there were weapons of mass destruction  in 
Iraq or the personalities of office holders (Szabo 2004).  If these tensions and the parallel 
support  of German  governments  for  a  European  Security  and  Defence  Policy  (ESDP), 
established  in  1999,  are  any  indicator,  then  German  emancipation  has  not  been  halted 
(Forsberg 2005). To be sure, this process  is not path dependent.  However,  if support for

303

the  vision  of  a  European  Peace  Order  upheld  through  unity  is  central  to  German 
policymakers,  an  America whose  national  biography does  not accommodate this vision 
and  is  unwilling to  build  ‘the  West’  in  a mutually empowering manner will  not be  that 
friend Germany is looking for.

If that  is  so,  and  if German-American  friendship  is  important to the  vitality  of NATO, 
then  doubts  of whether NATO  can  re-invent  itself as  a creative  forum  for building  ‘the 
West’  should  be  taken  seriously.  Hence,  my  analysis  suggests  that  Atlanticist  scholars 
were not entirely wrong to diagnose the “twilight of the West” (Coker  1998) and to note 
that  preventing  its  “collapse”  (Harries  1993)  required  a  new,  unique  long-term  vision 
carrying  the  West  and,  hence,  NATO 
(Huntington  1996).  In  other  words,  whereas 
constructivists celebrated the ‘survival’  of NATO throughout the  1990s as an  intellectual 
triumph  over  realism,  neoconservatives  may  have  been  more  on  target  when  they 
warned  that  the  Atlantic  Alliance  lives  on  “borrowed  time”  and  that  “Europeans  and 
Americans  have yet to discover the  idea that will  energize their cooperation” (Gompert 
1997:  4).  This  warning  holds  if one  takes  into  account that,  from  a  phenomenological 
perspective,  such  a  ‘discovery’  must  be  anchored  in  significant  experiences.  If,  as 
suggested  in  chapter  five,  experiences  of violent  conflict  leave  a  particular  mark,  then 
American  interventions  such  as  in  Vietnam  and  the  Gulf  in  1991  and  2003  and  the 
terrorist  attacks  from  September  11,  2001,  have  reduced  the  shared  experienced  space. 
Common  interventions  in  Kosovo  (1999)  and  Afghanistan  (2001),  which  required  the 
Schroeder government to further adjust Germany’s national biography, did not appear to 
recreate  common ground  for resonance but,  if anything,  increased  German commitment 
to ESDP (Berenskoetter and Giegerich, 2008).

That  said,  just  as  NATO  cannot  be  reduced  to  a  vehicle  of  the  German-American 
relationship,  emancipation  only  occurs  if  dissonance  is  enduring  and  if  there  is  an 
alternative significant Other with whom an authentic biographical narrative can  be more 
satisfactorily negotiated. The thesis suggested that France emerged as this new friend for 
Germany, yet to assess its depth and complete the picture further research would need to 
flesh this out.  Similarly,  it would be necessary to more carefully assess the dynamic and 
depth  of  the  British-American  friendship  through  NATO  as  an  alternative  to  the 
German-American  relationship.  Here  also  arises  a  broader  conceptual  question  not 
engaged  in  this  thesis,  namely  that  multiple  friendships.  Even  though  this  thesis 
discussed friendship primarily as a dyadic phenomenon and made a case for the  limit of 
multiple  friendships  due  to  the  need  of maintaining  authenticity  (see  chapter  seven),  it 
did not exclude the possibility of there being more than one significant Other. Aristotle’s

304

note that it is “impossible to be an extremely close friend to many people” (NE Book IX, 
10) reminds that true friendship are rare yet does not put a specific limit onto the number 
of close friends one may have. This opens up the question of degrees of friendship, that 
is,  of whether  some  friends  can  be  closer than  others  and  whether  multiple  friendships 
may work  in complementing ways.448 In that sense, more than anything, this thesis is an 
invitation  to  further  explore  the  promises  and  limitations  of friendship  in  international 
politics.

448  Consider  the  analogy  of the  Self as  house  with  many  rooms  where  different  friends  have 
access  “to  different  rooms  at  different times  or  venture  into  them  in  a  different  order”  (Allan, 
1989:  14f.). See also Simmel’s discussion of differentiated friendships (Simmel  1950: 324-326).
