Introduction 

In partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Industrial Control Systems Cyber 
Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), the FBI, and the Information Technology ISAC, WaterISAC has 
developed a list of 10 basic cybersecurity recommendations water and wastewater utilities can use to 
reduce exploitable weaknesses and defend against avoidable data breaches and cyber attacks. Each 
recommendation is accompanied by links to corresponding technical resources. This document is an 
updated version of the 10 Basic Cybersecurity Measures to Reduce Exploitable Weaknesses and Attacks 
guide that WaterISAC published in August 2012. 

In reviewing its incident reports for 2014, ICS-CERT noted that implementation of the first three 
recommendations likely would have detected the issues, prevented the vulnerabilities, and averted the 
resulting impacts related to those incidents. Although risks remain and threat actors will continue to 
change their capabilities and methods, ICS-CERT advises that the first three recommendations be 
implemented as soon as practical. 

For further measures to reduce cyber risks, consult the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure 
Cybersecurity by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the American Water 
Works Association’s (AWWA’s) Cybersecurity Guidance and Tool. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is 
a set of voluntary practices, standards, and guidelines created to help critical infrastructure owners and 
operators manage cyber risks. The AWWA Guidance and Tool is a sector-specific approach for adopting 
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

help water and wastewater utilities and the government agencies that support them mitigate risks and 
resolve vulnerabilities.

10 Basic Cybersecurity Measures 

1 

1)  Maintain an Accurate Inventory of Control System Devices and Eliminate Any Exposure of 

this Equipment to External Networks 

Never allow any machine on the control network to talk directly to a machine on the business 
network or on the Internet. Although some organizations’ industrial control systems may not 
directly face the Internet, a connection still exists if those systems are connected to a part of the 
network – such as the corporate side – that has a communications channel to external (non-
trusted) resources (i.e., to the Internet).  

Organizations may not realize this connection exists, but a persistent cyber threat actor can find 
such pathways and use them to access and exploit industrial control systems to attempt to create a 
physical consequence. Therefore, organizations are encouraged to conduct thorough assessments 
of their systems, including the corporate enterprise segments, to determine where pathways exist. 
Any channels between devices on the control system and equipment on other networks should be 
eliminated to reduce network vulnerabilities.

2)  Implement Network Segmentation and Apply Firewalls 

Network segmentation entails classifying and categorizing IT assets, data, and personnel into 
specific groups, and then restricting access to these groups. By placing resources into different 
areas of a network, a compromise of one device or sector cannot translate into the exploitation of 
the entire system. Otherwise, cyber threat actors would be able to exploit any vulnerability within 
an organization’s system – the “weakest chain in the link” – to gain entry and move laterally 
throughout a network and access sensitive equipment and data. Given the rise of the “Internet of 
Things” – whereby many previously non-Internet connected devices, such as video cameras, are 
now linked to systems and the web – the importance of segmenting networks is greater than ever.  

Access to network areas can be restricted by isolating them entirely from one another, which is 
optimal in the case of industrial control systems (as described in recommendation #1 above), or by 
implementing firewalls. A firewall is a software program or hardware device that filters the inbound 
and outbound traffic between different parts of a network or between a network and the Internet. 
For connections that face the Internet, a firewall can be set up to filter incoming and outgoing 
information. By reducing the number of pathways into and within your networks and by implementing 
security protocols on the pathways that do exist, it is much more difficult for a threat to enter your 
system and gain access to other areas. 

Creating network boundaries and segments empowers an organization to enforce both detective and 
protective controls within its infrastructure.  The capability to monitor, restrict, and govern 
communication flows yields to a practical capability to baseline network traffic (especially traffic 
traversing a network boundary), and identify anomalous or suspicious communication flows.

These boundaries also provide a means to practically detect potential lateral movement, network 
footprinting and enumeration, and device communications attempting to traverse from one zone to 
another.

3)  Use Secure Remote Access Methods 

The ability to remotely connect to a network has added a great deal of convenience for end users, 
but a secure access method, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN), should be used if remote 
access is required. A VPN is an encrypted data channel for securely sending and receiving data via 
public IT infrastructure (such as the Internet). Through a VPN, users are able to remotely access 
internal resources like files, printers, databases, or websites as if directly connected to the network. 
This remote access can further be hardened by reducing the number of Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses that can access it by utilizing network devices and/or firewalls to specific IP addresses 
and/or ranges and from within the U.S. Note that a VPN is only as secure as the devices connected 
to it. A laptop computer infected with malware can introduce those vulnerabilities into the network, 
leading to additional infections and negating the security of the VPN.

4)  Establish Role-Based Access Controls and Implement System Logging 

Role-based access control grants or denies access to network resources based on job functions. This 
limits the ability of individual users – or attackers – to reach files or parts of the system they 
shouldn’t access. For example, SCADA system operators likely do not need access to the billing 
department or certain administrative files. Therefore, define the permissions based on the level of 
access each job function needs to perform its duties, and work with human resources to implement 
standard operating  procedures to remove network access of former employees and contractors. In 
addition, limiting employee permissions through role-based access controls can facilitate tracking 
network intrusions or suspicious activities during an audit. 

Implementing a logging capability allows for the monitoring of system activity. This enables 
organizations to conduct thorough root cause analyses to find the sources of issues in the system, 
which may have been the activities of an employee or an outsider. Monitoring network traffic also 
allows organizations to determine if a user is making unauthorized actions or if an outsider is in the 
system, which provides an opportunity to intervene before problems are manifested.

5)  Use Only Strong Passwords, Change Default Passwords, and Consider Other Access 

Controls 

Use strong passwords to keep your systems and information secure, and have different passwords 
for different  accounts. Hackers can use readily available software tools to try millions of character 
combinations to attempt an unauthorized login – this is called a “brute force attack.” Passwords 
should have at least eight characters, but longer passwords are stronger, because of the greater 
number of characters to guess. Also, include uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and special 
characters. Change all default passwords upon installation of new software, particularly for 
administrator accounts and control system devices, and regularly thereafter. Implement other 
password security features, such as an account lock-out that activates when too many incorrect 
passwords have been entered. Organizations may also consider requiring multi-factor 
authentication, which entails users verifying their identities – via codes sent to devices they 
previously registered – whenever they attempt to sign-in.

6)  Maintain Awareness of Vulnerabilities and Implement Necessary Patches and Updates 

Most vendors work diligently to develop patches for identified vulnerabilities. But even after patches 
and updates have been released, many systems remain vulnerable because organizations are either 
unaware of or choose to not implement these fixes. In its 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report, 
Verizon observes that many breaches are enabled by not addressing these known vulnerabilities, 
noting that 99.9% of exploited vulnerabilities were compromised more than a year after public 
disclosure of the issue. Moreover, Cisco’s 2015 Annual Security Report points out that 40% of CISOs 
interviewed in a survey indicated they did not have system patching programs in place. These 
unpatched vulnerabilities amount to a “low-hanging fruit” that cyber criminals can easily take 
advantage of. 

To protect one’s organization from these opportunistic attacks, a system of monitoring for and 
applying system patches and updates should be implemented. WaterISAC regularly posts 
information on vulnerabilities and patches, which it receives from its partners at the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security’s ICS-CERT and United States Computer Emergency Readiness 
Team (US-CERT), other ISACs, and cybersecurity firms, among others.  Where possible, organizations 
should also consider setting systems and software to auto-update to avoid missing critical updates. 
These updates are designed to fix known vulnerabilities and are encouraged for any Internet-
connected device.

7)  Develop and Enforce Policies on Mobile Devices 

The proliferation of laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices in the workplace 
presents significant security challenges. The mobile nature of these devices means they are 
potentially exposed to external, compromised applications and networks and malicious actors. 
Further contributing to this challenge is the increasing trend of organizations allowing employees 
to use their personal electronic devices for work purposes, known as the “Bring Your Own Device 
(BYOD)” phenomenon. 

Therefore, it’s important to develop policies on the reasonable limits of mobile devices in your 
office and on your networks. These measures should be strictly enforced for all employees, as well 
as for contractors. Devices should also be password protected to ensure only authorized users can 
log-in. Otherwise, an unauthorized user can gain access to restricted networks and files using an 
authorized user’s device. Similarly, employees should avoid or be cautious about using devices that 
do not belong to them as they cannot be sure these are properly protected or comply with 
established policy. Such devices may actually be infected, and using them could put the information 
and networks you access at risk.

8)  Implement an Employee Cybersecurity Training Program 

Cybersecurity for critical infrastructure sectors that operate industrial control systems, such as the 
water and wastewater sector, is extremely important given that these systems are increasingly 
being targeted. The 2015 Dell Security Annual Threat Report reports a doubling of the number of 
attacks against SCADA systems in 2014 as compared to 2013. Like any security enterprise, 
cybersecurity requires teamwork with all members of an organization playing a part in identifying 
potential threats and vulnerabilities and bringing them to the attention of others. When employees 
aren’t involved in cybersecurity, not only can vulnerabilities and threats go unnoticed but the 
employees themselves can become conduits through which attacks are executed. Therefore, 
employees should receive initial and periodic cybersecurity training, helping to maintain the security 
of the organization as a whole. 

While cybersecurity is an expansive field, there are certain topics that should be emphasized for 
general awareness. One such topic is social engineering, which continues to be a popular means for 
cyber criminals to prey upon unsuspecting employees. These methods involve emails (“phishing”), 
phone calls, or other types of personal interactions in which malicious actors attempt to entice 
employees into providing  sensitive personal or corporate information, such as account passwords 
or details about information technology infrastructure. Alternatively, these actors might attempt to 
make employees perform specific actions, such as pay for alleged services, download infected

attachments, or visit malicious websites. Unsolicited emails, phone calls, and other correspondence 
from unknown senders should be viewed with particular caution. 

Training should also incorporate the importance of smart Internet browsing practices. Visiting 
suspicious websites may expose users to infection by malware embedded on the site (a “drive-by-
download” attack). Even legitimate websites, as well as the files on them, may be compromised. 
Cyber attackers employ a variation of this type of tactic, a “watering-hole” attack, to target the 
employees of a company they know will visit the website. Therefore, caution should be exercised no 
matter where a user navigates and the materials that are downloaded.

9)  Involve Executives in Cybersecurity 

Despite the continued proliferation of cyber threats and the far-reaching effects cyber attacks can 
have, researchers have found that organizational leaders are often unaware of cybersecurity threats 
and needs. In a study of cyber incident response by the Ponemon Institute, researchers found that 
only 20% of IT security professionals surveyed regularly communicated with management about 
threats. Additionally, just 14% of these individuals reported that executive management participated 
in the incident management process. The study authors note that a deficit of involvement and 
awareness by organization executives may make it difficult to secure funding for cybersecurity 
measures and to get the support of leadership for company-wide efforts.  

While organizations are increasingly elevating cybersecurity to the executive level by adding the role 
of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), a recent report from ThreatTrack Security found that 
this position has yet to achieve a sufficient level of respect and acceptance. Specifically, it found that 
44% of executives believe CISOs should be accountable for any organizational data breaches, but 
54% believe CISOs should not be responsible for cybersecurity purchasing decisions. The report 
concludes that organizations must do a better job of understanding and utilizing this position. 

Additionally, involving executives in cybersecurity now will help them to address cybersecurity in 
their interactions with external stakeholders, such as if they are questioned following an incident. In 
its report, M-Trends 2015: A View from the Front Lines, Mandiant discusses how the press, 
partners, investors, and consumers now demand more details about cyber breaches, including the 
type of malware used and how attackers gained access. Mandiant notes that victim organizations 
realized “how crucial strong, consistent communication is in the wake of major breaches” given the 
calls for timely information and the speculation that will arise when it is not provided.

10)  Implement Measures for Detecting Compromises and Develop a Cybersecurity Incident 

Response Plan 

Despite the many preventative measures organizations implement, many still experience 
compromises. Indeed, many cybersecurity experts have noted that experiencing a compromise is 
not really a question of “if,” but more of a question of “when.” When a compromise occurs, the 
organizations that fare the best will be those that quickly detect the issue and have a plan in place to 
respond. 

Implementing such measures as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems 
(IPSs), anti-virus software, and logs (previously described in recommendation #4) can help to detect 
compromises in their earliest stages. Most IDSs and IPSs use signatures to detect port scans, 
malware, and other abnormal network communications. New viruses are discovered every day, and 
anti-virus programs are oftentimes set to automatically update themselves to look for the latest 
threat signatures. Still, administrators should not rely solely on anti-virus software for detecting 
infections. Logs from firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention sensors, and servers should be 
monitored for signs of infections. 

Incident response plans are a critical yet underutilized component of emergency preparedness and 
resilience. An effective cybersecurity response plan will limit damage, increase the confidence of 
partners and customers, and reduce recovery time and costs. Plans should include measures for 
reacting to destructive malware in an ICS environment.  In such situations, organizations should be 
prepared to “island” their ICS environments by disconnecting from non-ICS networks. They should also 
be capable of going to “manual operations” if network conditions impact visibility from the SCADA 
system, or if malware potentially renders control devices inoperable via an automated means.   

Rather than being developed by a single entity, the plan should be a product of collaboration between 
all departments that would be stakeholders in a cybersecurity incident. This will ensure a cooperative 
and unified response that leverages all of an organization’s resources to the greatest extent possible. 
For enhanced responsive capability in the event of a cybersecurity incident, organizations should 
consider forming a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). 

This task is not complete once the plan has been developed; it needs to be operationalized as well. It is 
critical that plans be routinely reviewed and updated to ensure they remain relevant and useable for 
when they are actually needed. Furthermore, to truly understand their cybersecurity incident response 
plan, organizations must practice them through regular exercises. This will ensure that all stakeholders 
understand the procedures that would be implemented in the event of a significant cyber disruption 
or breach, enabling a more effective and efficient response.
