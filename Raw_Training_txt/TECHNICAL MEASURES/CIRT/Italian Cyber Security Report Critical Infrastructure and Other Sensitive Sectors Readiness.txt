Preface

Every economy of an advanced nation relies on information systems and interconnected networks, thus in
order to ensure the prosperity of a nation, making cyberspace a secure place becomes as crucial as securing
society from the presence of criminal bands. Cyber security means ensuring the safety of this cyberspace from
threats which can take different forms. Stealing secret information from national companies and government
institutions, attacking infrastructure vital for the functioning of the nation or attacking the privacy of the sin-
gle citizen can all be seen as extreme examples of a large spectrum of threats. Additionally, perpetrators of
attacks on cyberspace are now professionals working for governments, hacktivist organizations or criminal
bands rather than teenagers looking for some short-term celebrity as it was in the old days. Intelligence op-
erations are conducted through cyberspace in order to study the weaknesses of a nation and, to complete the
picture, in the military domain cyberspace is now seen as one of the dimensions of the battleﬁeld just like
space, sea, ground and air. Understanding the complexity of the picture of making cyberspace a safe place
turns out to be a problem which is not only technical but rather a social, legal and economic one. Improving
cyber security knowledge, skills and capability of a nation will be essential for supporting an open society and
for protecting its vital infrastructures such as telecommunication networks, power grid networks, industries,
ﬁnancial infrastructures etc.

This report gives a break down of the Italian standpoint in the context of the protection of national critical
infrastructure and other sensitive sectors from cyber attacks from the legal and technological viewpoints. In
particular Chapter 1 discusses the notion of critical infrastructures and cyber security in the US and the EU. It
goes on to discuss the evolution and the number of cyber attacks sector by sector reported in the world and in
Italy and to provide some numbers related to the cost of cyber crime in Italy. In Chapter 2 the Italian scenario is
introduced in terms of the legislative landscape and of regulatory changes in the last decade. The chapter then
analyzes the current situation of the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) present in Italy. Chapter 3
gives an overview, from both a legislative and operational perspective, of the level of maturity of some devel-
oped countries (namely, France, the UK, Germany and the USA) in protecting their critical infrastructure and
other sensitive economic sectors. From this comparison, it seems Italy lags behind other developed countries
in terms of implementation of cyber security strategy. Italy still lacks a clear operational directive for the cre-
ation of a national CERT which makes difﬁcult, on one hand, assessing the exposure of Italy to cyber attacks
and, on the other hand, quick and coordinated deployment of countermeasures, in particular, when advanced
persistent threats are discovered.

In order to conduct a deep analysis of the Italian cyber security situation, an anonymous questionnaire
was sent to the four main sectors of the Italian economy i.e. public administration, utilities, large industries -
sensitive to intellectual property theft - and the ﬁnancial sector. Chapter 4 discusses the results of this exercise.
Among other observations, the study points out that some sectors are not fully aware of being a sensitive sec-
tor for cyber attack and that a breach in its information system could cause an economic/technical problem
at national or EU level, that the defense measures (already employed) neglect advanced persistent threats, but
that organizations have, on average, good recovery capability. The report also proposes a cyber security readi-
ness index which is computed through four indexes, namely the awareness index, the policy index, the defense
index and the external independence index. Each of these indexes is computed by aggregating several answers

i

to the questions proposed in the questionnaire. Results are reported in a radar chart showing cyber security
readiness proportional to the area covered by the radar chart. According to the results, the utility sector ex-
hibits better readiness than other sectors while the public administration sector has deﬁnitely got the smallest
readiness index. Considering the results of the questionnaire, the experiences of other countries and the Ital-
ian legislative landscape, Chapter 5 presents a set of recommendations for a national cyber security strategy.
These recommendations span all the phases of the risk management process. In this preface it is worthwhile
highlighting that the following are considered priorities: the realization of a national CERT (with a clear role
and mission), cooperation among operators in the same sector and with the best sectors of academia, the
conceivability of a national cyber security agency that embeds necessary capabilities and skills for an efﬁcient
strategy implementation and a nationwide methodology for classifying threats and adapt the dimension of the
response. The interested reader can go through the complete recommendation list for details.

Securing the national cyberspace and protecting the critical infrastructure can also be seen as a giant na-
tional economic opportunity for growth in terms of industrial capability and research. At the time of writing,
Italy has a very good worldwide standing in the cyber security sector with the presence of key sector players,
high-tech small-medium enterprises and highly reputed research centers. This makes Italy a breeding ground
for cyber security initiatives that could be a source of employment for the current and next generations. All
other developed countries are investing huge amount of resources in this sector to make their cyberspace a
safe place for their citizens to visit and for businesses to operate whilst Italy is investing zero resources. Con-
sidering the pervasiveness of cyberspace and its relevance in any form of economy for the present and the
future, the security that a nation will be able to provide for its cyberspace will be a measure of its indepen-
dence, of its economic strength and of its capability to maintain its wealth for the following generations. This
is why in the future the study will, hopefully, be extended to small-to-medium sized businesses, that are the
heart of Italian economy, to assess their awareness of the cyber threats that can steal their intangible assets.

Let me ﬁnally thank all the authors of this report, Gabriella Caramagno, Elizabeth Lee, Reto Haeni, Carlo

Iantorno, Luisa Franchina, Pier Luigi Dal Pino, Marina Brogi, Luigi Vincenzo Mancini, Fabrizio d’Amore, Giuseppe
Ateniese and the Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministers. We are expecially grateful to the respondents
to the questionnaire. We really hope that this report will help us in gaining trust in order to increase the num-
ber of respondents for the next editions. The work has been partially supported by the MIUR PRIN TENACE
project and by Microsoft.

Critical Infrastructures, Sensitive
Organizations and Cyber Threats

In order to understand how Italy is facing the delicate issue of critical cyber infrastructure in terms of gover-
nance, it is necessary to brieﬂy examine the deﬁnition of the scope of the analysis, i.e. what critical infrastruc-
tures are, which organizations can be considered sensitive due to their role in society and what cyber security
is: the combination of these concepts allows for the identiﬁcation of the economic sectors that are sensitive to
cyber attacks. With reference to the critical infrastructure (CI), despite the numerous attempts made, there is
still no universally recognized deﬁnition, or at least a deﬁnition that provides a classiﬁcation suiting the char-
acteristics of each nation. It is often identiﬁed as the infrastructures whose incorrect functioning, even for a
limited time period, may negatively affect the economy of individual subjects or groups, involving economic
losses and/or even expose people and things to a safety and security risk [6]. Box I reports the deﬁnitions of
critical infrastructure that can be found in US and EU formal documents.

Even though there is some difference, in essence both the above deﬁnitions look at identifying potential
threats like human error, occasional accidents, terrorist attacks that can lead to a malfunction or onset of the
crisis of the CI under observation. Moreover, the European Commission highlights that if an accident occurred
in a member state, it could have an impact on other states, as a result of increased interdependencies between
infrastructures relating to various member states. These infrastructures are, thus, considered European Criti-
cal Infrastructures (ECI). The designation to ECI is the result of a complex technical-political process that arises
from the potential impact that can be caused by a failure and/or destruction of an infrastructure in terms of
sectoral and inter-sectoral relevance. The inter-sectoral evaluation criteria relate to:

a) potential victims, in terms of number of fatalities or injuries;

b) potential economic effects, in terms of ﬁnancial losses, deterioration of products or services and environ-

mental effects/damages;

c) potential effects on population, in terms of loss of public conﬁdence, physical suffering and disruption of

daily life, including the loss of essential services.

Brieﬂy, EU directive 114/2008 lays down rules for the owners and/or operators concerning the security
of their infrastructure to prevent, or at least mitigate, consequences on other nations. In other words, given
the pan-European role played by such large infrastructure, security levels must conform to a high qualitative
standard and, thus, the rules to be adopted are not deﬁned only by the member state in which an infrastructure
is located but, to some extent, they are imposed at European level.

An essential component of the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP)1 is the
Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN), a protected public Internet-based information
and communication system that allows subjects involved in Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) to share
CIP-related information and good practices (Box II reports the ﬁrst initiatives in this ﬁeld).
In Italy, according to the Working Group on CIP(Gruppo di Lavoro sulla Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche)
established by the Department of Innovation and Technology (Dipartimento per l’innovazione e le tecnologie)
within the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, critical infrastructure is identiﬁed as:

1EPCIP is the 2004 European program dedicated to the identiﬁcation and protection of ECI.

Deﬁnition of critical infrastructure in the United States

The term critical infrastructure means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United
States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on
security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters [45].

As early as 1998, US legislation had revealed that ownership/management of critical infrastructure is mostly
private. It is a complex system that synergistically produces and distributes a continuous ﬂow of essential goods
and services [43].

Deﬁnition of critical infrastructure in the European Union

1. Critical Infrastructure (CI) means an asset, system or part thereof located in member states which is
essential for the maintenance of vital society functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-
being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a signiﬁcant impact in a member
state as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.

2. European Critical Infrastructure (ECI) means critical infrastructure located in member states to which
the disruption or destruction would have a signiﬁcant impact on at least two member states. The sig-
niﬁcance of the impact will be assessed in terms of cross-cutting criteria. This includes effects resulting
from cross-sector dependencies on other types of infrastructure [20].

Box I: Some deﬁnitions of Critical Infrastructure.

The United States was the ﬁrst, in 1996, to perceive the importance of the issue of CIP, beginning a series of
analysis and studies that took shape in 1998 with President Clinton issuing Presidential Decision Directives 62
and 63.

At the European level, only in June 2004 did the European Council call for a comprehensive strategy for the pro-
tection of critical infrastructure and in October of the same year, the European Commission proposed measures
to strengthen the European Union’s (EU) prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist attacks on critical
infrastructure, with a series of proposals to enhance prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist attacks
[14].

Box II: The ﬁrst measures in the ﬁeld of CIP.

“the combination of networks and systems including industry, institutions, and distribution facilities that

operate in synergy and produce a continuous ﬂow of essential goods and services for the organization,

functionality and economic stability of a modern industrialized country, whose destruction or temporary

unavailability can cause a debilitating impact on the economy, daily life or the ability of a country to defend

itself”[32].

This deﬁnition highlights the systemic and network aspect of critical infrastructure, emphasizing that the crit-
icality is not so much in the value of the single component, but rather in its systemic relevance.

Focusing on the concept of network and systemic nature to deﬁne critical infrastructure, the presence of
interdependencies is relevant. On the one hand, the phenomenon of integration brings beneﬁts in terms of
efﬁciency, quality of service and cost reduction, but on the other hand, it determines an intrinsic vulnerability
and new types and forms of threats. It is possible to analyze the interdependencies by considering six different
dimensions[39]:

1. Environment: it is inﬂuenced by the operating state and condition of each infrastructure, and it in turn

exerts pressures on the individual infrastructures.

2. Types of interdependencies: we can deﬁne the following four principal classes of interdependencies:
physical, cyber, geographic, and logical. Two infrastructures are physically interdependent if the state
of each one is dependent on the material output of the other. An infrastructure has a cyber interde-
pendency if its state depends on information transmitted through cyberspace. Infrastructures are geo-
graphically interdependent if a local environmental event can determine changes in their state. Finally,

2

two infrastructures are logically interdependent if the state of each one depends on the state of the other
via a mechanism that is not a physical, cyber, or geographic connection.

3. State of operation: the state of operation of an infrastructure has to be considered as a continuum that
exhibits different behaviors during normal operating conditions, during times of disruption, or during
times when repair activities are under way.

4. Infrastructure characteristics.

5. Type of failures: interdependencies could increase the risk of failure or disruption in infrastructures.

6. Degree of coupling: the propagation time and the transmitted intensity of a possible malfunction vary

in function of the degree of coupling.

Information systems are fundamental to the organizational structure and the mechanisms of operation of
business, industry and government institutions. However, such systems, especially with reference to critical
infrastructure, are vulnerable to growing violations due to interconnectivity [22]. Types of interdependence
among infrastructures became more important, so increasing the cyber risk exposure for the private sector
and the public sector in a national and an international context. The importance of cyber risk is due to its
potential disastrous effects, especially when you consider that one criteria deﬁning the critical infrastructure
is the analysis of the impact of any damage to the same infrastructure. It is worth pointing out that only some
of the damage resulting from a cyber risk can be evaluated in economic terms (production losses, damage to
property, theft of cash, etc.), while others are less obvious [7].

Interference with information systems could result in loss of consumer and shareholders’ conﬁdence, re-
sulting in a negative reputation and, therefore, in value destruction [5]. If attention is focused on the aspects
associated with the presence of cyberspace relating to CIP, it is referred to as Critical Information Infrastructure
Protection (CIIP). The boundary between CIP and CIIP is very weak, because of the tight inter-relationships
between the physical world and the virtual world. Literature often considers the two terms as interchangeable,
and some authors have suggested the use of the acronym CI(I)P. Considering the peculiar traits due to the dig-
ital domain, the cyber threat for CIIP in the cyberspace domain raises urgent and complex challenges in the
ﬁeld of protection and security.

Box III provides deﬁnitions of cyberspace and cyber security. It can be seen as the notion of cyber security
includes (but it is not limited to) critical infrastructure protection from cyber attacks. Cyber security includes
also the protection of other economic sectors that are sensitive to cyber attacks.

Cyberspace

Cyberspace is a set of interconnected computing infrastructures, including hardware, software, data and users
as well as the logical relationships between them. It includes, among other things, the Internet, communication
networks, process actuators systems and mobile devices equipped with a network connection.

Cyber Security

Cyber security is the condition in which cyberspace is protected with respect to voluntary or accidental events,
consisting in the acquisition and transfer of data, in their modiﬁcation or unlawful destruction or the blocking
of information systems, thanks to appropriate security measures. These measures include safety audits, man-
agement of security updates (patches), authentication procedures, access management, risk analysis, detection
and response to incidents/attacks, mitigation of impacts, recovery of components subject to attack, training
and education the personal, and veriﬁcation and enhancement of the physical security of the premises where
information and communication systems are placed.

Box III: Cyberspace and cyber security deﬁnitions [31].

It is important to understand the differences among the following expressions: cyber security, cyber crime
and cyber terrorism. Cyber crime is identiﬁed as the set of offenses ranging from identity theft to scams via
Internet banking and cyber ransom. Therefore, cyber crime concerns the civil area. Cyber terrorism concerns
the military area: it consists, in fact, in the set of actions that organizations or groups accomplish in cyberspace
for subversive purposes. For both areas, civil and military, cyber security is critical. Cyber security is “the
collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches,

3

actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment
and organization and user’s assets” [51]. This sector is characterized by an evolving and not fully completed
regulatory framework and a complexity coming from the combination of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) with other systems essential to the sustainability of the key features of modern societies.
Therefore, cyber security is a very interesting issue for both academics and professionals [1, 9, 40]. In Europe
two main priorities have been identiﬁed:

1. protection of infrastructures based on ICT identiﬁed as critical infrastructure;

2. protection from cyber crime.

In 2009, the European Commission outlined a plan of immediate action to strengthen the security and
resilience2 of Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). The activities of this plan are carried out within and in
parallel with the EPCIP program, concerning the critical infrastructure protection. The action plan is organized
in ﬁve pillars (see table 1.1, ﬁrst column). In 2011, the European Commission published the results achieved
following the implementation of the action plan for the protection of CII, in each of the ﬁve areas. These results
are summarized in the table 1.1.

Table 1.1: The ﬁve pillars established in Action Plan 2009 with their results.

The ﬁve pillars established in Action Plan 2009

Results achieved (Report 2011)

Preparedness and prevention:
for the deﬁnition of
common standards and the establishment of ade-
quately prepared national Computer Emergency Re-
sponse Teams (CERTs).

Detection and response: for the adoption of a Euro-
pean Information Sharing and Alert System EISAS.
Mitigation and recovery: for the elaboration of na-
tional emergency plans and the organization of na-
tional and pan-European exercises on the response
and the disaster recovery as a result of security inci-
dents on large-scale networks.

International cooperation: for promoting European
priorities in terms of safety, at the international level
and to participate in exercises at the global level.
Criteria for European Critical Infrastructure in the ICT
sector: for implementing the identiﬁcation and pro-
tection plan of ECI imposed by Directive 114/08.

In 2009, ENISA (European Network and Information
Security Agency) and the national CERTs established
and approved CERTs minimum skills and services, in
order to operate properly in support of pan-European
cooperation. In the same year the European Forum
of Member States (EFMS) was established to facili-
tate the communication and exchange of information
between authorities of the member states. In addi-
tion, the European Commission adopted the Euro-
pean Public-Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R)
to foster cooperation between the public sector and
the private sector on security and resilience of ICT
systems.
ENISA developed a roadmap for the development, by
2013, of EISAS.
ENISA has developed a good practice guide for ex-
ercises at national level and strategic recommenda-
tions for the development of national strategies. On
November 4, 2010 the ﬁrst pan-European exercise re-
lated to security incidents on communication net-
works (Cyber Europe 2010) was held.
Principles and European guidelines for the resilience
and Internet stability were formulated on the basis of
the EFMS’ work.
A ﬁrst draft of the criteria for identifying European
Critical Infrastructure in the ICT sector was produced,
with special focus on ﬁxed and mobile communica-
tions and the Internet.

More recently (in February 2013), the European Commission published a European strategy for cyber se-
curity [16] deﬁning the principles that should guide the EU cyber security policy. Although member states are
primarily responsible for security in cyberspace within the national borders, the European strategy proposes
actions to improve the overall EU performance. These actions, both short and long term, involve EU organiza-
tions, the member states and the private sector. In particular, the EU Strategy is structured into the following
ﬁve strategic priorities:

2The ability of a system to return to its original state after an unexpected event.

4

1. Achieving cyber resilience. The legislative proposal concerning the European strategy for cyber security

plans:

• To establish common minimum requirements of Network and Information Security (NIS) at the
national level by requiring member states to appoint specialist national authorities in the ﬁeld
of NIS, to establish well-functioning national CERTs, and to adopt a NIS strategy and a national
cooperation plan. A European CERT (CERT-EU) was established in 2012.

• To foster cooperation and information sharing between the specialist national authorities, to re-
spond to cyber incidents with an international dimension. EFMS favors communication between
the specialist authorities of the member states.

• To improve the readiness and the involvement of the private sector. The majority of computer
systems and telecommunications networks are in the private sector, thus it is essential to improve
the involvement of the private sector in the context of cyber security.

2. Drastically reducing cyber crime. Cooperation between the member states is important for responding
to the growing threat of cyber crime. The European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), formed in 2013 within
Europol, is the European reference point for the ﬁght against cyber crime. EC3 facilitates collaboration
and information sharing between the authorities of the member states, the private sector and other
stakeholders.

3. Developing cyber defense policy and capabilities related to the Common Security and Defence Pol-
icy (CSDP). Cyber defense focused on the detection, response and recovery against cyber threats is es-
sential to increase the resilience of systems in the NIS. In this context, the European strategy involves
strengthening the synergy of the civil and military sector for the protection of critical information in-
frastructures. This effort should be supported by research, development and collaboration between the
governments of the member states, the private sector and the academic sector.

4. Developing the industrial and technological resources for cyber security. Many global leaders offer-
ing innovative ICT products and services are located outside the EU. The risk for Europe is to depend
too much on non-EU ICT and security solutions. Research and development provide the EU with the
opportunity to promote a reliable European ICT sector, boost the internal market and reduce Europe’s
dependence on foreign technology. The European Commission intends to use Horizon 2020 to promote
research and development in the ﬁeld of security and privacy in the ICT sector, and the development of
tools to combat criminal and terrorist activities involving cyberspace.

5. Establishing a coherent international cyberspace policy for the European Union and promoting core
EU values: the EU strategy is aimed at maintaining an open, free and secure cyberspace. The Euro-
pean Commission intends to develop a coherent international policy in the ﬁeld of cyberspace aimed
at increasing engagement with key partners and key international organizations and improve the coor-
dination, promoting the fundamental values of the EU. This policy encourages the efforts for the devel-
opment of standards of behavior and enforcement of international laws in cyberspace. It also promotes
the Budapest Convention to combat cyber crime.

1.1 Critical infrastructures and sensitive organizations subject to cyber

attacks

In 2006, the European Commission deﬁned network and information security as “the ability of a network or
an information system to resist, at a given level of conﬁdence, accidental events or malicious actions that
compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and conﬁdentiality of stored or transmitted data and the
related services offered by or accessible via these networks and systems” [12]. CII is thus crucial both because
it is critical itself and because it serves other critical infrastructure as well. CIP includes “the programs and
activities of infrastructure owners, operators, manufacturers, users, and regulatory authorities which aim at
keeping the performance of critical information infrastructures in case of failures, attacks or accidents above
a deﬁned minimum level of services and aim at minimizing the recovery time and damage”[12]. As regards
cyber crime, there is still no single deﬁnition, mainly because of the differences in the legislation of the various
member states. The European Commission, in a communication of 2007 [13], said, in general, that it includes

5

“the criminal acts committed against electronic communications networks and information systems or by
means of such networks and systems”.

Over the years, governments have drafted lists identifying the areas in which critical infrastructure oper-
ates. Table 1.2 shows the sectors pointed out as critical by the US government, in the recent Presidential Policy
Directive 21 [44], and the European Commission, as stated in the proposal, Directive on European Critical
Infrastructure in 2006 [11].

*Critical sectors that have transitioned in the ﬁnal version of the European Commission Directive [20].

Direct correspondences exist between some American and European critical areas, e.g. the ﬁnancial ser-
vices and the energy sector. The banking and ﬁnancial services play a vital role in the economy of each coun-
try, so that a violation would be a huge risk for the entire system (see Box IV). Also the energy sector is critical.
Electrical energy has various features, including the ease of conversion into other forms of energy (mechani-
cal, light, thermal, etc.), the ease and ﬂexibility of transport, the possibility of a widespread distribution and,
at the same time, it is storable, only in limited quantities. This means that, at any time, the demand must
be balanced by the production of energy. The need to use ICT technologies exposes the mentioned areas to
the risk of computer breaches. The American and European classiﬁcations of critical sectors show, also, some
differences. First, the list provided by the US government is more detailed, for example, it pays attention to
activities concerning public services, such as heritage preservation, emergency services, government activ-
ities. Moreover, agriculture is considered a critical sector. This is due to the fundamental mission that the
government attaches to this sector: the ability to provide safe and nutritious food, hence the need to protect
it from possible attacks, which would represent a serious threat to public health, safety, welfare, and thus the
national economy. The European ICT sector may correspond to the union of the two critical areas of American
information technology and communications. Another difference concerns the water sector identiﬁed by the
European Commission which should correspond to the union of the two sectors water and dams listed by the
US government. Finally, in the European list there are two separate entries, space and research facilities, which
do not have a direct correspondence in the US list, although the former may fall within the communications
sector and the second may fall in government facilities. The EU directive proposal constitutes a ﬁrst milestone
in a step-by-step approach to identify and designate ECIs and assess that need to improve their protection. As
such, the ﬁnal version of this Directive [20] solely concentrates on the energy and transport sectors, paving the
way to future reviews in order to include other sectors within its scope.

In the ﬁnancial sector, operational risk has wide-ranging systemic implications given the increasingly large size,
interconnectedness, and complexity of ﬁnancial institutions which increase the possibility of errors and fraud.
Disruptions to the ﬂow of ﬁnancial services because of impairment of all or part of the ﬁnancial system may
give rise to systemic risk and possible spillover effects to the real economy. The magnitude of such disruptions
depends on asymmetric information and network externalities. System and process failures are particularly
dangerous if they occur in the clearing and settling of ﬁnancial transactions as well as in the trading and pric-
ing of ﬁnancial instruments. Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) which facilitate the clearing, settlement,
and recording of monetary and other ﬁnancial transactions can strengthen the markets they serve and play a
critical role in fostering ﬁnancial stability. However, if not properly managed, they can pose signiﬁcant risks to
the ﬁnancial system and be a potential source of contagion, particularly in periods of market stress. An FMI
is deﬁned as a multilateral system among participating institutions, including the operator of the system, used
for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other ﬁnancial transac-
tions (“Principles for ﬁnancial market infrastructures”, BIS and OICV-IOSCO, April 2012). Financial institutions
in general are connected directly and indirectly to their customers, to other ﬁnancial institutions, and to their
service and utility providers; accordingly, operational risk may be imported from connected entities. The fall-
out from the recent ﬁnancial crisis has illustrated that many sources of systemic risk were triggered or at least
propagated by vulnerabilities in operational risk management of market and payment infrastructures. As a
consequence, global leaders recognized a greater role of operational risk. The policy resolutions of the Group of
Twenty (G-20) Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in September 2009 mark a shift of ﬁnancial sector regulation
from internal controls and sound risk management practices to macro prudential regulation for systemic risk
and contingency planning. For banking supervisors, operational risk is inherent in all banking products, activi-
ties, processes, and systems, and the effective management of operational risk has always been a fundamental
element of a bank’s risk management program. In order to implement in our system the EBA’s Guidelines on In-
ternal Governance (27 September 2011), the circular no. 263 - New regulations for the prudential supervision of
banks was emended in July 2013 (15th amendment). Among others, the most important innovations are related
to:

• The discipline of information systems, taking into account the main developments which emerged on
the international scene and setting the main constituents of governance and organization of the infor-
mation system, IT risk management, all the requirements to ensure the security and the system manage-
ment of data. The provisions also provide that the deﬁnition of principals security for access to critical
systems and services through the Internet channel are applicable Recommendations of the ECB in the
ﬁeld of security of online payments.

• The Business continuity discipline, by reorganizing provisions presently contained in different regula-
tion sources. Among others a process of rapid escalation by accident in emergency was deﬁned so as to
ensure that the declaration of a state of crisis happened in the shortest possible time from the detection
the accident. The total time for recovery will not exceed four hours, including times for the stages of
analysis , decision-making , technical assistance and veriﬁcation.

• The formalization of the role of the CODISE Working Group (the business continuity working group set
up in 2002 ) as the structure responsible for the coordination of crisis management operating in the
Italian ﬁnancial system. The group is coordinated by the Banca d’Italia in agreement with the CONSOB
(the Italian stock exchange commission) and consists of representatives of the leading banking groups
and the companies that manage infrastructures essential to the orderly working of the ﬁnancial system.

The problem of cyber threat in the ﬁnancial sector has been investigated in [3] and [2] where a complex event
processing infrastructure supporting an information sharing system has been introduced to face cyber attacks
and frauds happening at distinct organizations.

1.2 Italian critical IT infrastructure

In Italy, attacks on computer security have had an exponential growth in recent years. Assinform3 estimated
that 40% of attacks require at least 4 days to be solved. In 90% of cases the attack is successful due to incorrect
conﬁguration of the security system and the lack of speciﬁc skills. The costs incurred by the private sector and
the government to protect themselves are high: Gartner4 quantiﬁes them at $55 billion in 2011, $60 billion
in 2012 and an expected $86 billion in 2016. These data show the increased importance of cyber security,
as evidenced by the annual reports of the “Sistema di Informazione per la Sicurezza della Repubblica”5. The
2010 report is very important because for the ﬁrst time cyber security was included in the category of Growing
Challenges and deemed a matter of national security [27]. Moreover, the 2012 report highlights that the threat
landscape is changing, also regarding the use of advanced technologies, “able to have a profound effect on
the continuity of functions and vital interests of the country...”. From here, the role of information policy for
security is an essential component of the safeguarding of main national interests.

In January 2008, the Minister for the Interior issued a decree on“the identiﬁcation of critical IT infrastruc-

ture of national interest” [28], which in art. 1 states:

“The critical information infrastructures of national interest are the systems and computer services support-

ing the institutional functions of:

a) Ministries, agencies and supervised authorities, operating in the ﬁelds of international relations, security,

justice, defence, ﬁnance, communications, transport, energy, environment, health;

b) Bank of Italy and independent authorities;

c) State-owned companies, regions and metropolitan areas covering at least 500,000 people, operating in the

ﬁelds of communications, transport, energy, health and water conservation;

d) Any other institution, administrative ofﬁce, authority, public or private legal person whose business is consid-
ered of national interest because of public order or security, by the Minister for the Interior or at the proposal
of the prefects - provincial authorities, public security”.

1.3 Critical economic sectors targeted by this report

This report considers the below list of economic sectors sensitive to cyber threats that include the ones in the
EU directive n.124 [20] (European Critical Infrastructure) and the ones in a decree issued by the Italian Ministry
for the Interior Decree n.101 of 2008[28]. Additionally, following a recent trend that considers the defense of
the intellectual property of national industries as a priority for the economy of the nation, we put in the list the
industries that are subject to intellectual property theft.

• plants and energy networks, e.g. power plants, oil and gas plants, depots and reﬁneries, transmission

and distribution systems;

• communication systems and information technology and computer networks, e.g. telecommunica-

tions, broadcasting services, software, hardware and networks, including the Internet;

• the ﬁnancial system: banks; ﬁnancial infrastructures that facilitate the clearing, settlement and record-
ing of monetary and other ﬁnancial transactions; ﬁnancial institutions directly connected with their
customers, to other ﬁnancial institution and to their service and utility providers;

• the health care system, e.g. hospitals, pharmaceutical industry, rescue and emergency;

• food supply (food industry, hygiene safety systems, manufacturing and wholesale distribution);

• water supply, e.g. reservoirs, storage and treatment of water supplies;

• transportation;

1.4 The cyber threat: current situation and future trends

The critical infrastructure of every country, ranging from oil pipelines to the electricity grid, from gas to water,
from transportation, to ﬁnancial/banking systems, to public services, is increasingly electronically managed.
The progressive introduction of network, monitoring and control systems, as well as the interdependence that
has arisen, has certainly improved the performance level of such infrastructure, but it has also allowed access
to cyber criminals, with consequent cyber attacks and the increasing risk of a domino effect.

Therefore, the scenario has became more and more complex in recent years, as the introduction of ad-
vanced technology added new sources of potential risk alongside the traditional threats. An effective in-
frastructure protection includes threat identiﬁcation, vulnerability reduction and attack source identiﬁcation.
This activity aims at service downtime minimization and damage limitation.

The expression cyber threat denotes the set of behaviors that can be carried out in and through cyberspace. It
consists in cyber attacks: actions of individuals, states or organizations, aimed at destroying, damaging or in-
terfering with the proper functioning of the systems and networks and/or systems actuators process controlled
by them, or violating integrity and conﬁdentiality of data/information. Depending on the actors and purposes,
we have:

• cyber crime: all the activities with criminal purposes (such as, for example, fraud or wire fraud, identity

theft, the misappropriation of information or creative and intellectual property);

• cyber espionage: wrongful acquisition of sensitive property or classiﬁed data or information;

• cyber terrorism: the set of ideologically motivated actions, aimed at inﬂuencing a country or an interna-

tional organization.

This categorization has a merely descriptive value, it being understood that the contraindicated action has often
no peculiar characterization: an intrusion into a computer system, for example, can be instrumental in data
theft for proﬁt intent (criminal matrix), espionage or terrorism and even, in activities of so called hacktivism or
cyber agitation (the use of computers and related systems, with or without the use of techniques of hacking as
a form of ideologically motivated protest).

Box V: Cyber threat deﬁnition [31].

Typically, a cyber attack is launched:

1. to paralyze the critical infrastructure activities;

2. to steal infrastructure information assets.

It is important to evaluate the possible targets so as to assess the consequences, also in terms of time re-
quired to restore normal behavior (resilience). Cyber threats are important challenges for the country, because
they involve both the digital domain and because of their transnational nature. Cyber threats are not easy to
counter: the actors, means, objectives and attack techniques vary continuously (see Box V). Moreover, the
attacks may have different origins:

• cyber crime;

• cyber terrorism;

• cyber espionage.

These attacks may even cause a cyber war, a real conﬂict between nations fought trying to paralyze their
vital sectors. It is clear that when the attacks target critical infrastructure and warning systems the conse-
quences for the entire society could be disastrous. In light of the above and of the awareness that this is a

9

continuously changing environment, it is urgent to intervene, at the national level and beyond, against all
cyber crime forms, which represent a growing threat to critical infrastructure, society, business and citizens.
However, it is rather complex to detect the size of the phenomenon, partly because the operators are reluctant
to give exact ﬁgures on the number of attacks suffered. In 2012, according to the Verizon 2013 Data Breach In-
vestigations Report[52], various sectors were hit by cyber attacks: 37% of the violations were against ﬁnancial
institutions, 24% against retailers and restaurants, and 20% against industry, transport and utilities, and the re-
maining percentage were violations against professional and information services. Different percentages are
provided by Clusit Report 2013 [8] (see Table 1.3), which analyzed 1.183 attacks that took place in 2012. The
only data remarked in all reports is that it is a growing phenomenon.

Since 2009 the number of criminal and terrorist actions against energy corporations has nearly doubled. A
recent survey [54] conducted by Carnegie Mellon University CyLab and promoted in Italy by AIIC (Association
of Italian Experts in Critical Infrastructure) revealed that of 108 companies worldwide, organizations in the
ﬁnancial sector are equipped with the best practices in the ﬁeld of cyber security and risk management, while
companies in the energy and utilities sector have the worst. Despite more than 90% of organizations adopting
risk management, only 33% have the intention to manage security in terms of information risk, 29% showed
interest in IT operations and only 13% intend to target the suppliers of software and other services.

As far as Italy is concerned, according to Clusit data [8], in 2012 the government sector was the most at-

tacked sector immediately followed by political organizations and industry (see Figure 1.1).

The Verizon report also revealed that, in 2012, the greatest number of cyber attacks were for economic
reasons: 75% of attacks were ﬁnancial cyber crimes, followed by government espionage campaigns, aimed,
primarily, at the theft of intellectual property (government information, trade secrets and technical resources),
which determined 20% of cyber threats. In particular, espionage attacks are not conﬁned to government agen-
cies and military departments but include production companies, IT and professional organizations.

Considering the methods of attack, the most popular was hacking, which featured in more than half (52%)
of data breaches. Analyzing a sample of Italian cyber attacks, Clusit highlights [8] that in 2012 attacks motivated
by cyber crime grew more than those related to hacktivism activities (see ﬁgure 1.2); despite this, attacks due
to hacktivists still remain the most substantial portion (67%) of the total.

With regard to types of cyber threats, the McAfee annual report, 2013 Threats Prediction, revealed that
mobile devices are already, and will be even more so, in the crosshairs of cyber crime. The inﬂuence of the
Anonymous group should decrease, while large-scale attacks against critical infrastructure will probably in-
crease. The trend is fueled by the changing technological landscape: smartphones and tablets are becoming
very important for every type of service 6.

6Norton (2012) reveals that, compared to 2011, cases directly related to social networks and mobile devices are on the
rise, affecting about 21% of the sample of respondents (about 13,000 adults aged between 18 and 64 years in 24 countries).

Figure 1.1: Breakdown of number of attacks (percentage on 129 attacks analyzed) by sector in Italy (source:
Clusit, 2012).

On the front of cyber crime, according to data from Symantec [41], in 2012 Italy was ranked ninth globally
for the spread of malware and occupies the ﬁrst place in Europe (and fourth place in the world) for its number
of infected PCs controlled by hackers (so-called botnets).

Figure 1.2: Evolution of cyber threat origins in Italy (source: Clusit, 2013).

Even if the percentage of people connected to the Internet in Italy with at least one device [25] is smaller
than other EU countries (see ﬁgure 1.3), in the last year the number of people connected to the Internet (aged
between 11 and 74 years old) has reached about 33 millions (+ 8,3% on a yearly basis).

The number of people actively connected to the Internet has also increased consistently on a daily basis
(+13.2%), passing from 12 million in 2011 to 14.8 million in 2012. Furthermore, the number of older people
using social networks recorded an increase (see ﬁgure 1.4) as did the intensity of usage [25]. Speciﬁcally, the
average time spent by Italians on social networks is equal to about one third of total online time during the
month (6 hours out of 19).

In general, however, the development of apps and online services will bring more security threats, because,
thanks to online services, users perform many more operations directly from their device. Under attack is,
therefore, the general public, public services, and business - especially the ﬁnancial sector.

The main cause of the spread of attacks is the limited use of threat protection solutions. Only 33% of Italian
users (the percentage rises to 44% on a global scale) actually uses software able to ensure the necessary security
of their data and only 45% of Italian users employ privacy settings to control the information they share with
their contacts. In addition, 44% of users in Italy (about 40% in the world) do not use complex passwords or
change their keywords frequently. The number of criminal activities and the level of sophistication of attacks
do not correspond to a proportional growth of attention.

Despite the large and increasing use of the Internet among Italians, there is still a low level of awareness of
the risks associated with careless use of the Internet. Consequently people buy products and services which are
inherently insecure, or implement and conﬁgure in an insecure manner, without any guarantee or protection.
As reported in ﬁgure 1.5, the main consequence [34] in Italy is that about 44% of PCs are attacked by malware
while browsing the Internet, compared with 20% in Denmark [33].

Furthermore, the question of the direct costs generated by the activities of cyber criminals is very impor-
tant. The Norton Cybercrime Report 2012 found costs between 2011 and 2012, of about $110 billion globally
and just under 2.5 billion euro at the Italian level, relating, respectively, to the number of victims of 556 million
and 8.9 million. A study conducted by ABI Research estimated that global spending on security will increase
to $1.8 billion by 2018, partly as a result of the intensiﬁcation of electronic defenses with new Internet security
solutions related to data center systems and control procedures (see Section 1.5).

In the light of the data provided and given its strength and spread, the cyber threat could be fought on two
levels. On the one hand, it is necessary to enhance international cooperation and create shared terminology,
rules and practices in order to respond to any attacks made on a large scale. On the other hand, it is necessary
to build a national strategic framework for cyber security.

In this direction, in Europe, the following two most urgent objectives have been identiﬁed: to increase the
awareness of key risks related to cyber security and to improve European and national preparedness and re-
sponse capabilities to cyber attacks or incidents. Both with respect to the ﬁrst objective and with reference to
European initiatives against cyber crime, the European Commission will support dialogue between the mem-
ber states and between them and the European Community institutions, as well as between the key players
in the public and private sector. For this purpose, ad hoc structures have been created, e.g. the aforemen-

aspects, the reaction to attacks or cyber incidents varies considerably between EU member states. Efforts to
bridge the gap between the most and least equipped focus on the dissemination of skills and training, but also
on the creation, in each member state, of CERTs. As stated above, these and other structures will be discussed
in more detail in the next sections.

1.5 The cost of cybercrime in Italy

Currently there are no ofﬁcial statistics on the cost of cybercrime in Italy. The only available statistics come
from the private sector. According to the Norton Cybercrime Report [37] (September 2012), which analyzes the
impact of cyber crime on consumer users, the total net cost of consumer cyber crime in Italy in the previous
12 months amounts to 2.45 billion euros, whereas the cost at global level amounts to $110 billion (about 85
billion euros). The report estimates the number of cyber crime victims to be 8.9 million people, about one
third of Internet users active in Italy in 2012 [8]. This results in an average cost per person of 275 euros (more
than the global average cost per person, estimated to be 197 US dollars). In particular, Norton registers an
increasing number of victims among mobile and social network users, suggesting that cyber crime is evolving
towards new technologies. Indeed, approximately 17% of adults in Italy have been victim of social or mobile
cyber crime in 2012, and about 10% of social network users have had someone hack into their proﬁle.

In the business context, an analysis led by the Ponemon Institute[38] estimates the cost of data breach in
Italy, in terms of direct, indirect and opportunity costs incurred by an organization in response to data breach.
The analysis, conducted in 2011 and published in March 2012, reports the average cost of data breach per
record (i.e. the total cost divided by the number of compromised records) and the average total organizational
cost of data breach. As shown in ﬁgure 1.6, the average cost per record incurred by Italian organizations is 78
euros. This cost accounts for a range of business costs: detection (26 euros), notiﬁcation (3 euros), ex-post
response (22 euros) and lost business (27 euros). The majority of the total cost (41 euros) is due to indirect
costs, while the remaining part (37 euros) is due to direct costs.

Figure 1.7 shows the average total organizational cost of a data breach (1,384,798 euros) and its constituent
costs. Both ﬁgures show that the largest cost is represented by lost business. This cost is mainly due to abnor-
mal turnover in customers (a higher than average loss of customers for the organization) and reputation loss.
Indeed, customers often abandon the organization after a data breach. The analysis also revealed that the pri-
mary cause of data breach is negligence (39%), followed by system glitches (33%) and malicious or criminal
attacks (28%). However, malicious attacks are on average the most costly.

and malicious software in Italy and worldwide, related to the period July through December 2012. The report

Cyber Security: Italian Governance
and Legislative Overview

The intrinsic characteristics of cyber security require a national strategic plan for critical infrastructure protec-
tion organizations and the identiﬁcation of practices to realize this as well as response actions to threats with
technical and organizational tools able to face the new socio-technological context and the new interdepen-
dencies produced by cyberspace. In other words, a governance of cyber security. To achieve this goal primary
and secondary regulation which individuates speciﬁc competency areas, jurisdictional areas, involved sub-
jects, types and modalities of a-priori and a-posteriori intervention is needed, thus applying extra-national
regulations. The growing number of threats and security breaches has already caused considerable economic
damage, leading to reduced user conﬁdence in the use of new services and technologies and hindering the
development of electronic commerce and the realization of the so called digital agenda in Italy. In fact in this
area Italy presents a slight delay in the deﬁnition of the governance of cyber security. Even though the cyber
security issue has been debated since early 2000, signiﬁcant improvements in the identiﬁcation of a road-map
for the implementation of a national Italian strategy have been observed only recently.

2.1 Actors involved in cyber security governance

This section describes the legislative landscape during the last decade and the assets that now are leading the
process of making Italy a secure place from cyber threats.

1999-2004 (D.M. 378/September 1999, D.M 28 September 2001, D.M January 2003) The Inter-
Ministerial decree of 21 September, 1999 established a working group made up of representatives from the
Ministry of Communications (Ministero delle Comunicazioni), Ministry of Justice (Ministero della Giustizia),
and Ministry of Interior (Ministero dell’Interno), with the task of operating in the sector of network security
and communications protection as a support to administrative and regulatory interventions. To achieve these
goals the working group mainly dealt with internationally harmonized regulations in the telecommunication
sector.

In 2003, the working group became the Permanent Observatory for Network and Communications Protec-
tion and Security (Osservatorio permanente per la sicurezza e la tutela delle reti e delle comunicazioni) within
the Ministry of Economic Development (Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico). The observatory was estab-
lished with the Inter-Ministerial decree of 14 January, 2003. Its aim is to take into account the technological
and regulatory evolution of the different aspects of the telecommunications sector, with particular attention to
security. It is permanently integrated with representatives of the Ministry of Defense (Ministero della difesa),
Department of Public Service (Dipartimento per la funzione pubblica), Department of Innovation and Tech-
nology (Dipartimento per l’innovazione e le tecnologie) and Ministry of Productive Activities(Ministero delle
attività produttive).

The observatory, among others, has played a supporting role aimed at transposing Directive 2002/58/EC
into reality. This directive concerns the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the elec-
tronic communications sector, and the legislative decree concerning the Electronic Communications Code
(Codice delle comunicazioni elettroniche) which was issued September 16, 2003.

17

In October 2001, the Technical Interdepartmental Committee of Civil Defense (Commissione Inter Minis-
teriale Tecnica della Difesa Civile - CITDC) was established as a political and military unit (supporting Nucleo
Politico Militare) supporting organ for the technical coordination of civil defense activities in case of crises.
It operates within the Department of Fire and Public Rescue and Civil Defense (Dipartimento dei Vigili del
Fuoco e del Soccorso Pubblico e della Difesa Civile), as part of the Central Directorate for Civil Defense. It has
the role of evaluating emergencies and planning the measures to be taken in the event of crisis. The committee
also considers other hypotheses of risk, not directly related to malicious acts, which can lead to situations of
crisis for the continuity of government as well as damage to the population and, in general, the security of the
country. In this sense, the committee and the department delve into the issues related to critical infrastructure
and, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the management of a crisis produced by the spread of
serious epidemic diseases. The CITDC meets at the Ministry of Interior which presides over it and ensures the
coordination of the central government departments involved.

In March 2003, the Ministry for Innovation and Technology established the Working Group on CIIP , in
which representatives from ministries involved in critical infrastructure management (Interior, Infrastructure,
Communication, etc.), major private providers (ABI, ASI, CESI, GRTN, RFI, Snam Rete Gas, Telecom Italia,
Wind and others) and the research and academic world took part. In March 2004, this working group issued
the document Critical Information Infrastructure Protection: The Italian Situation, in which the results of work
carried out during the previous year are reported.

2005-2006 (D.L. n. 155 of 31/7/05)
In 2005, the Ministry of Communication established a special working
group to analyze the responsibilities and security requirements that CII imposes on communication infras-
tructure operators, and to analyze the dependencies of the latter on other critical infrastructure. This working
group has issued several guidelines1. As far as critical information infrastructure protection is concerned, the
legislative decree (D.L.) n. 155 of 31/7/05 (the so called Legge Pisanu) conferred jurisdiction to the Ministry of
Interior, identifying the Postal and Communications Police as the unit responsible for law enforcement initia-
tives against cyber attacks on critical information infrastructures

In 2005 by Legislative Decree n.82/7 (March 2005) the Digital Administration Code (CAD) (Codice
dell’amministrazione digitale) was introduced as a primary point of reference for the Italian PA sector; the code
constitutes the necessary premise for implementing the process of digitalization of administrative activities as
a prerequisite for real modernization of public bodies. A proper and effective use of these instruments begins
from the stage of acquisition of services and equipment , for which DigitPA (see below) offers its know-how,
through the formulation of opinions on policies issued by central PA, monitoring plans and ICT the publication
of guidelines on the quality of ICT goods and services , which are valid for all PA, central and local. Since 2005
several working groups have been set up by DigitPA for the implementation of CAD and documentation related
to the following topics:

• Formation and conservation of an electronic document system and management of document ﬂows;

• Digital identity;

• Access to PA data;

• Business continuity and critical infrastructure in the PA sector;

• Digital signatures.

Box VI: The Digital Administration Code (CAD) [26].

In 2006 a new coordinating body was established, the so called Tavolo PIC (Inter Ministerial Coordina-
tion Platform) and Contact Point for the Sector of Critical Infrastructure Protection (Tavolo interministeriale
di coordinamento per la protezione delle Infrastrutture critiche). It is chaired by the Military Advisor to the
President of the Minister’s Council.

Tavolo PIC assigned the CITDC to set the CI identiﬁcation criteria and has determined, from time to time,

the national position on the initiatives and activities in the EU and other international forums.

(2005); Guideline on Managing Local Emergencies (2006).

2008 (CNAIPIC) To improve the protection of critical information infrastructures against cyber threats, in
2008 the Ministry of the Interior established the National Anti-Cybercrime Center for the Protection of Criti-
cal Infrastructure (Centro Nazionale Anticrimine Informatico per la Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche -
CNAIPIC) as a special unit within the Postal and Communication Police Service [28].

CNAIPIC acts as a police authority for all activities of prevention, repression and contrast of criminal ac-
tions committed against the different critical infrastructure through cyberspace. For this purpose CNAIPIC
and critical infrastructures maintain and protect exclusive dedicated ICT links, for a mutual and constant shar-
ing of data and information relevant to the assessment, prevention and repression of threats and cyber crime
(see Box VII).

In 2012, the CNAIPIC managed a total of 286 events relating to the damage of critical information infrastructures
of national interest (private and institutional). In particular, the Operations Room of the CNAIPIC managed:

• 136 DDOS attacks or defacement, against internet services related to institutional sites and critical in-

formation infrastructure of national interest;

• 61 intrusions and unauthorized access to computer systems related to critical infrastructure or institu-

tional databases;

• 51 compromised authentication credentials on the computer systems of critical infrastructure, imple-

mented through computer viruses and BOTNETS.

• Furthermore, CNAIPIC also issued 38 alerts for computer system /data transmission vulnerabilities.

During this year, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the activity of public-private partnership, which led the
signing of four new agreements by Enel, H3G, Finmeccanica and Atac.

Box VII: CNAIPIC’s activities in 2012 [8]

CNAIPIC carries outs its functions through the activities of the Operational Sector (Settore Operativo) and

Technical Sector. The service is organized into distinct areas of intervention which include [30]:

• Cyber terrorism;

• Copyright;

• Hacking;

• Critical infrastructure protection;

• E-banking;

• Analysis of emerging criminal phenomena;

• Betting and gaming systems on line.

Furthermore, the Unit of Cybercrime Analysis (Unità d’analisi del crimine informatico - UACI) was established,
within the service, to study and analyze the phenomenon of cyber crime in partnership with major Italian
universities.

Territorial departments have an organization similar to this service, but with a more operative proﬁle and
more bounded to their jurisdictions. These departments manage the legal cases and the emergencies that
arise from reports made by citizens to police hot lines.

In order to enhance the effectiveness of strategy against cyber crime, the Communications Police partic-
ipate with some of its representatives in permanent working groups established by the government or inter-
national organizations, including the Inter Ministerial Group for Network Security (Gruppo Inter Ministeriale
per la sicurezza delle reti), G8, the European Community, the Council of Europe, OCSE, Interpol, Europol.
Moreover, it cooperates with institutions and private operators dealing with communications in general.

2009 (SCIIC)
for Critical Infrastructure Protection (Segreteria di Coordinamento Inter Ministeriale per le Infrastrutture critiche

Following the EU Directive 114/2008, in 20092 the Inter Ministerial Coordination Secretariat

- SCIIC) was established within the Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The aim is to ensure coor-
dination, coherence and synergy between the initiatives and activities of the authorities concerned with the
protection of CI.

The functions of the SCIIC are attributed to an operational nucleus 3. In addition to the aspects of civil
protection associated with risk CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear), SCIIC is responsible
for coordinating Inter-Ministerial activities (including those of an international context) which regard critical
infrastructure. The SCIIC is under the control of Military Adviser to the President of the Council of Ministers.

2010 (DPCM 5 May 2010)
In 2010, by decree, the President of the Council of Ministers established the Or-
ganization for Crises Management, which led to a reorganization of the crises management system by creating
new bodies, such as:

• (art. 4) the Political Strategic Committee (Comitato politico strategico - CoPS) a permanent body, which
has been set up within the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and tasked with the political and
strategic guidance of crises. It is chaired by the prime minister and is composed of the Ministers of
Defense, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Treasury, Economic Development; It meets exclusively during a state
of crisis, and builds on the results of the pre-decisional phase undertaken by the technical staff.

• (art. 5) the Inter Ministerial Unit for Situation and Planning (Nucleo interministeriale situazione e piani-
ﬁcazione - NISP) is responsible for supporting CoPS and the President of the Council of Ministers. The
NISP, which replaced the Political Military Unit, is a non-permanent body which systematically moni-
tors the national and international security situation to foresee and prevent possible crisis. It relies on
an early-warning system provided by the bodies represented within the NISP. The NISP in its activities
is supported by CITDC.

In the event of an international crisis or attack (including CBRN) involving more than one critical infras-
tructure, the prime minister who is in charge of operations, uses CoPS’s structures and coordinates with CPS
(Comitato Politico Strategico) and NISP; the latter one cooperates with CITDC in order to manage the emer-
gency involving civil defense.

A common secretariat for CoPS and the NISP was instituted in the same year (DPCM 22 December 2010)
and called Secretariat for Critical Infrastructure (Segreteria per le infrastrutture critiche - SIC). It has the task of
looking after the inter ministerial coordination of all national and international activities and of all technical
and scientiﬁc activities for the identiﬁcation and designation of ECI.

2011 (DL 61/2011)
In April 2011 the Italian government approved Legislative Decree 61/2011 which trans-
poses in Italy the European Directive on Critical Infrastructures. The decree made the NISP responsible for the
individuation and designation of an ECI, and integrates its composition with representatives of the ministries
involved (Economic Development, Infrastructure and Transportation, Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Civil Pro-
tection Department). This structure is also in charge of deﬁning sectorial criteria thresholds through which
the criticality of a structure is established.

From an operating point of view, the infrastructure’s operator, with the support of representatives of the
ministries involved and the responsible structure, draws up the Operator Security Plan (on the basis of the
minimum requirements stated by Annex B of the decree) PSO. The PSO identiﬁes critical infrastructure assets
and which security solutions exist or are being implemented for their protection. At procedural level it covers:
the identiﬁcation of important assets; risk analysis based on major threat scenarios, vulnerability of each asset,
and potential impact; identiﬁcation, selection and prioritization of counter-measures and procedures with a
distinction between permanent security measures and graduated security measures.

Furthermore, the same decree gives the responsibility for the protection of an ECI, at national level, to
the ministries involved and the Civil Protection Department and at local level, to the prefect with territorial
jurisdiction. A secrecy classiﬁcation, according to in force legislation, is also attributed to sensitive information
related to CI.

In May 2011, the Secretariat for Critical Infrastructure (Segreteria Infrastrutture Critiche - SIC) was desig-
nated as the NIPS supporting structure (mentioned in the Legislative Decree 61/2011). It supports NIPS with
technical and scientiﬁc activities, for individuation of an ECI and for cooperation with the European Commis-
sion with similar structures existing in other member states.

2012-2013 (ADI and AGID)
In March, the Italian Digital Agenda (Agenda Digitale Italiana - ADI) was ap-
proved. It is part of a decree about growth which tackles a number of areas that are key to economic devel-
opment at a critical juncture in the country’s history. The decree covers infrastructure investments, support
for easier creation and development of start-up companies, ﬁnancing schemes for small and medium sized
enterprises and broadband deployment in speciﬁc areas. As far as the government is concerned, it addresses
open data, digital identities, electronic health records, electronic student records and measures to make the
judicial system more efﬁcient by increasing the use of electronic communication and online notiﬁcations.

One of the biggest challenges will be re-engineering and digitalizing Italy’s public administration system,
which is currently very fragmented system. Only 20% of it is interoperable and individual authorities, in-
cluding for reasons of hanging on to power, claim difﬁculties in pooling information. Another area of great
signiﬁcance is the planned digitization of the education system, to which end the re-skilling of teaching staff
will also be crucial. ADI stresses the importance of investment in infrastructure aimed at improved access to
faster network for the population. It also stresses the need to ensure the safety and reliability of the infrastruc-
ture through the establishment of more efﬁcient networks which ensure high quality service and by building
structures dedicated to their preservation and protection (see Box VIII).

According to ADI, the national cyber security strategy plans to act on the following areas:

• Educate citizens, business and industry: raising awareness of the serious risks related to the web (e.g.

the UK initiative Get Safe Online, a public-private online campaign to raise awareness);

• Enhance threats detection and contrast tools: develop tools (organizations, processes, legislation and
applications) able to detect and contrast potential threats (e.g. the National Cyber Security Centre of
the Netherlands will adopt tools to enhance awareness and classiﬁcation of threats and vulnerabilities
through public-private information sharing);

• Promote education: create education paths able to provide the necessary competences from early school
years (e.g. the United States has issued a draft plan, National Initiative for Cyber Security Education
Strategic Plan, which outlines the educational steps, from primary school, for a career in cyber security);

• Strengthen public-private cooperation: create mechanisms of debate, sharing and coordination be-
tween the public and private sectors, especially with regard to critical infrastructure protection (e.g. Ger-
many, in its strategy, envisaged a National Cyber Security Council where representatives of the private
sectors are asked to participate as associated members);

• Strengthen mechanisms of international cooperation: involvement in international forums for the dis-
cussion of standards, policy and international principles on cyber security (e.g. the Czech republic’s
strategy envisages an active participation in EU and NATO forums);

• Create and enhance mechanisms for incident response: it is necessary to enhance, through the estab-
lishment of national CERTs and, in some cases, to create, specialized structures able to respond to cyber
attacks and incidents within national boundaries and able to coordinate with the corresponding centers
at international level.

• Deﬁne a standard for the management of digital identities as well as for guiding principles for the cre-
ation of a federated system at national and international level, able to satisfy the daily needs of digital
citizens, including improved security for Internet payment systems.

• Stimulate the growth of an Italian cyber security industry, concerning both technology/services, and
skills and talents. This will not only allow for the growth and maintenance of specialized competences,
but will also attract talent and experts from other countries.

Box VIII: ADI line of action on Italian cyber security [23].

A few months later Decree n. 83 15/6/2012 converted by law n. 147 established the Agency for Digital
Italy (Agenzia per il Digitale DigitPA). It is responsible for the implementation of the objectives of the Italian
Digital Agenda, taking into account the European Digital Agenda and the guidelines developed by the Steering
Committee (Cabina di regia, Article 47 of Decree-Law 9 February 2012, n. 5).

21

2012-2013 (Law 133/2012, DPCM 24 March 2013) Two other regulatory measures, adopted between
2012 and 2013, contribute to deﬁning organization and strategy for national cyber security. Law no 133 /20124
and DPCM 24 March 2013.

Law 133/2012 attributes new and more detailed responsibility in the ﬁeld of national cyber defense and
security to the Italian intelligence system. For instance this law gives the prime minister the power to issue
directives to the Intelligence and Security Department (Dipartimento informazioni per la sicurezza - DIS)5,
after prior consultation with the Inter Ministerial Committee for the Security of the Republic (CISR)6, and to
the security intelligence services in order to strengthen security intelligence activities for the protection of
critical infrastructure, with particular reference to national cyber defense and security. Regarding DIS, it will
coordinates intelligence activities directed at strengthening national cyber defense and security.

The DPCM 24 January 20137 deﬁnes the institutional architecture tasked with safeguarding national secu-
rity in relation to critical infrastructure and intangible assets, with particular attention to the protection of cy-
ber security and national security. It indicates the tasks assigned to each component and the mechanisms and
procedures to follow in order to reduce vulnerability, to improve risk prevention, to provide timely response to
attacks and to permit immediate restoration of the functionality of systems in the event of crisis. The decree
responds to the need to deﬁne a national strategic framework capable of protecting critical infrastructure from
cyber attacks. The DPCM identiﬁes three different levels of intervention:

1. Strategic and political level (level 1);

2. Operating level, granting support and coordination between all bodies involved (level 2);

3. Crisis management (level 3).

More speciﬁcally,

A. the decree assigns the prime minister the responsibility for the adoption (on the basis of CISR’s proposal) of
the national strategic framework and a national plan (deliberated by CISR) to ensure cyberspace security;
the prime minister has also the power to issue directives (after prior consultation with the CISR) to the
DIS and to the security intelligence agencies in order to strengthen security intelligence activities for the
protection of critical infrastructure, with particular reference to national cyber defense and security.

B. the decree assigns to the CISR the responsibility of deliberating the following activities:

1. overseeing the implementation of the National Plan to Secure Cyberspace;

2. approving the guidelines to facilitate effective collaboration between institutional and private operators
interested in cyber security, aimed at information sharing, best practices adoption and deﬁnition of
measures directed to cyber security:

• the elaboration of general and fundamental objectives in the ﬁeld of cyber security to be pursued
in the context of information policy for the security of the organizations involved in information
security;

• promoting the adoption of the necessary steps to ensure, in a coordinated manner, the full par-
ticipation of Italy at various international cooperation forums (both bilaterally and multilaterally,
both the EU and NATO), for the deﬁnition and adoption of policies and prevention and response
strategies;

• the elaboration of proposals for legislation and organization necessary to improve measures for

prevention and response to cyber threat, and for crisis handling.

4Law no. 133 of 7 August 2012 (published in the Ofﬁcial Journal no. 186 of 10 August 2012).
5By Law n. 124/2007, DIS supports the President of the Council of Ministers to ensure a fully uniﬁed approach in the
Security Intelligence System’s planning of intelligence collection as well as in the Security Intelligence Services’ analyses
and operational activities. DIS, among other activities coordinates the two Italian intelligence agencies, namely AISE and
AISI.

6Law n. 124/2007, CISR makes proposals and take decisions regarding the lines and general goals of security intelli-
gence, also setting intelligence requirements. The CISR consist of: the President of the Council of Ministers, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Economy and
Finance, the Minister of Economic Development.

C. The decree reinforces the role ceded by DIS, which is in charge of coordinating intelligence agencies in

order to reinforce cyber security.

In order to coordinate all the activities implicit in the CISR functions, art. 4 of the decree established the
Collegial Co-ordinating Body (Organismo collegiale di coordinamento), chaired by the Director General of the
DIS. Its main tasks are:

• to prepare all meetings regarding cyber security;

• to grant all preliminary investigations regarding CISR’s decision and acts;

• to monitor the implementation of the national plan to ensure cyberspace security, guaranteeing the

effectiveness of all private and public organizations involved.

Interestingly the Collegial Co-ordinating Body has the task inter alia of identifying potential threats and
vulnerabilities to national systems (both private and public) and deﬁning the best practices with the help of a
scientiﬁc committee which has been set-up at the Intelligence System Training School (Scuola di formazione
del Sistema di Intelligence). Public sector representatives (i.e. government, universities etc.) and private sector
representatives (i.e. research, industry etc.) will be part of this scientiﬁc committee. On the basis of guidelines
provided by CISR and information provided by all parties involved (PA, Intelligence Information system, Nu-
cleus for Cyber Security, Scientiﬁc Committee) the Collegial Co-ordinating Body coordinates the formulation
of the necessary indications in order to identify and recognize vulnerabilities in cyberspace; and to adopt best
practices and security measures. In addition to the above, it is worth mentioning the setting up of a so-called
Nucleus for Cyber Security (Nucleo per la sicurezza cibernetica) within the Military Adviser’s Ofﬁce. It is a
permanent body responsible for maintaining links and coordination between the different components of the
institutional architecture involved in various capacities in the ﬁeld of cyber security, in accordance with the
powers conferred by law to each of them. Members of National Intelligence, Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Economy and Finance,
Civil Protection and the Digital Agency are part of the Nucleus for Cyber Security. The nucleus was established
to support the prime minister in all activities concerning the prevention and/or preparation for a possible
crisis and the activation of warning procedures. The nucleus, among other activities, will:

a) promote the planning of the response to crisis situations by both government and private stakeholders and
the development of all necessary procedures for inter-ministerial coordination, ﬁtting in with the schedules
of Civil Defense and Civil Protection;

b) assess and promote procedures for information sharing, including with private stakeholders, for the dis-

semination of alerts relating to cyber events and crisis handling;

c) promote and coordinate cyber security exercises, both Inter-Ministerial and at international level, involving

the simulation of events.

In order to handle a crises event in a coordinated manner, the decree assigns to the NISP the role of Inter
Ministerial Cybernetics Crises Table. The inter ministerial body is chaired by the prime minister’s military
advisor and will include representatives of all the institutions involved. It will ensure that the response and
the appointment of the various departments’ and agencies’ responsibilities in relation to cybernetic crisis’s
are performed in a coordinated manner. The decree, furthermore, establishes a strict collaboration between
the Inter Ministerial Cybernetics Crisis Table and the national CERT (see next section) in order to deal with all
technical aspects in elaborating emergency responses.

Only one article, Article 11, in the decree refers to private operators. The decree establishes that private

operators8 (as required by this law or by prior special agreement) have to:

a) communicate to the Nucleus for Cyber Security - also via institutionally authorized assets as per Article 16-
bis, paragraph 2, letter b) of Legislative Decree n. 259/2003 - of each and every security or integrity breach
of their software systems, using protected broadcast channels;

b) use the best practices and cyber security measures deﬁned in Article 16-bis, paragraph 1, letter a), of Leg-

islative Decree n. 259/2003 and Article 5, paragraph 3, letter d) of this decree;

c) supply information to security information bodies and grant access to their data bases for the purpose of

the respective cyber security, in the cases provided by Law n. 124/2007.

8Those private operators identiﬁed by Article 1, paragraph 1, letter d) of the Decree of 9 January 2008 [28].

23

d) assist in managing cybernetic crises by helping to restore the working order of systems and networks that

they manage.

Private-public partnerships are crucial for mitigating cyber risks and fostering collaboration to improve cy-
ber resilience. These include information sharing initiatives which help government and businesses prevent,
protect, deter and recover from cyber threats. While partnerships have been established, several challenges
still prevent stakeholders from reaping the full beneﬁts of information sharing. The need to build trust among
parties and share actionable information is crucial. Jurisdictional boundaries, the fear of being held liable,
and the quality and quantity of information shared still represent major barriers to information sharing. Im-
portant progress has been made in using and promoting information sharing organizations. However, some
challenges still limit the information ﬂow between the public and private sectors. While many organizations
recognize the importance of information-sharing, some observe that there are still gaps regarding the “how,
what, when and to whom” [42]. Several factors, such as challenges related to the management and organiza-
tion of the group, the risk of a damaged reputation, legal repercussions and the lack of clear agreements and
expectations, may explain why the current environment is not fully effective [10].

2.2 Emergency response: focus on CERTs

A computer emergency response team (CERT) can be deﬁned as an organization responsible for setting up a
framework for responding to cyber security incidents. It provides the necessary services for handling incidents
and supports its constituents in their recovery from breaches of computer security. In order to mitigate risks
and to minimize the number of required responses, many CERTs also provide preventative and educational
services for their constituents. More recently the term CSIRT which stands for Computer Security Incident
Response Team is starting to replace CERT. It invokes a more holistic approach to security rather than relying
only on reactive forces. CERTs worldwide are generally founded and ﬁnanced by governments or academic
institutions. The reason for this is that government agencies are interested in protecting national security and
universities by their very nature try to ﬁnd solutions to new problems.

Historically, the name Computer Emergency Response Team is the designation for the ﬁrst team at Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU). CERTs existence is linked to malware, especially computer worms and viruses. After
the Morris Worm paralyzed a good portion of the Internet in 1988, CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University
was started under a US government contract.

To respect the indications of EU Directive 140/2009 and to achieve the target ﬁxed by the European agenda,
in several EU member states, governments have set up the so called National CERTs. The main goal of a na-
tional CERT, from a cyber security perspective, is to protect national and economic security, the ongoing oper-
ations of a government, and the ability of critical infrastructure to continue to function. Therefore a national
CERT typically monitors incidents at a national level, identiﬁes incidents that could affect critical infrastruc-
ture, warns critical stakeholders about computer security threats, and helps to build organizational CERTs in
the public and private sectors. Typical tasks of national CERTs include:

• establishing a national point of reference within a country or region to coordinate security incident

management activities;

• analyzing and synthesizing information on incidents and vulnerabilities disseminated by other CERTs,
vendors and technology experts to provide an assessment for their own constituents and communities;

• facilitating communications across a diverse area, in order to bring together multiple sectors (govern-
ment and military, critical services and infrastructures, commercial, academic, banking and ﬁnance,
transportation, etc) to share information and collaborate in addressing computer security problems,
such as widespread computer security incidents, threats and vulnerabilities;

• developing protocols and mechanisms for trusted interaction with other relevant stakeholders such as

the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, policymakers, etc.

Compared to other main EU countries, Italy has recorded a signiﬁcant delay in the setting up of the na-
tional CERT. Although the identiﬁcation of a national CERT at the MISE was introduced by Legislative Decree
28 May 2012, n. 70 (to comply with the transposition of Directive 2009/140/EC relating to electronic commu-
nications), to date there is not any operating structure of this type.

Table 2.1: Taxonomy of private-public information sharing system

Levels of communication

Information type

information sharing lifecycle

Strategic: The exchange of cyber security risk information among organiza-
tions enable companies and governments to develop a full plan to improve
cyber resilience based on best practices and lessons learned from others, or
to partner in the creation of a broader national plan.

Operational: The exchange of data needs to be integrated into the organi-
zation’s on-going risk management practices and policies. Operationally, the
organization should also have routine points of contact with major partners,
vendors, suppliers and customers to exchange information and receive re-
ports about incidents or issues, preferably through a center of excellence for
operational risk and security issues.

Technical: Once the incident has concluded, entities return to their more
normal state of sharing a limited or tailored set of data. It is critical that com-
panies have clear and trusted points of contact with whatever information
sharing clearing house it may use (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers,
Computer Emergency Response Teams, a national incident management ca-
pability, a local law enforcement agency, etc.) so that when a cyber incident
begins, the organization can draw on known contacts and familiar processes
until a normal operational state is achieved.

Threats: The exchange of comprehensive and timely alerts and information
on attacks can help private and public organizations determine the nature
of an attack, implement a mitigation strategy or advise others on how to re-
spond to an imminent attack. It enables an organization to gather the most
up-to-date threat data, integrate it in their systems and processes, make real-
time decisions and take defensive actions.

Vulnerabilities: Sharing information about vulnerabilities and new discov-
eries helps organizations address weaknesses before they are exploited and
shift from reactive to proactive security measures. Sharing information on
known and “ﬁxable” issues can also be important, as a matter of good corpo-
rate citizenship.

Preventive: A preventive approach enables an organization to assess the cur-
rent threats and deﬁne a set of capabilities that should be met when imple-
menting its cyber risk management program.

Real time: To ensure such a response, an organization needs to establish
a systematic approach to manage alerts, oversee the network attacks and
monitor responses to incidents. Some organizations are already using one
or more real-time sources to react against cyber attacks.

Post event: Information sharing may also relate to a cyber incident that is no
longer active. It enables an organization to take advantage of lessons learned
from other organizations and integrate these in its cyber risk management
program. As such, an organization is able to improve its response mecha-
nisms and prevent future threats and attacks.

The main regulatory intervention on emergency response strategy and crisis management is basically
made up of the aforementioned decree of 24 January 2013. The decree ﬁxes the role and responsibility of
all bodies and organizations involved in national critical infrastructure security protection by deﬁning:

• all tasks and responsibilities assigned to each member,

• procedures to be followed in order to reduce vulnerability, to improve risk prevention, to provide timely
response to attacks and to allow for the immediate restoration of the functionality of systems in the
event of a crisis.

The government’s intentions were those of providing the organizational-functional model for a full inte-

gration between the activities pertaining to:

• the Ministry of Economic Development and the Agency for Digital Italy,

• the structures the Ministry of Defense dedicated to the protection of their networks and systems,

• the structures of the Ministry of the Interior dedicated to the prevention and combating of cyber crime

and civil defense, and those of civil protection.

As shown in the previous sections, the Decree has established the activities pertaining to the national
CERT. However, even after this further regulatory intervention, the national CERT is still far from a concrete
implementation. It is easy to assume that the national CERT should be developed according to public-private
model, in order to beneﬁt from the exchange of good practices, from the sharing of information, and in order
to implement a body which does not result in the need for further ﬁnancing. In fact, for the effective imple-
mentation of the actions outlined above, it plays central role in information sharing, as no person, though
endowed with great resources, can build a security system in total autonomy.

The national CERT should, therefore, be based on a cooperative model between public and private, which
is essential for rapidly building processes and services of information sharing and mutual support in case of
accident management on a large scale[53]. Such cooperation could be achieved by setting appropriate mem-
oranda of understanding and agreements, ensuring effective coordinated action in the event of an accident
with a greater reduction of impact and abatement costs. Another distinctive feature is that the CERT should
be closely connected with the academic world. Looking at the international experiences, the CERTs generally
tend to beneﬁt enormously from the close connection with the academic world; CERTs in fact, can exploit
academy’s capacity to produce the most innovative solutions in the ﬁeld of secure information and in educa-
tion.

The E-government 2012 Information Security Plan foresees the stabilization and strengthening of the
CERT of the Connectivity Public System (CERT del Sistema Pubblico di Connettività - CERT-SPC) within Dig-
itPA. The structure acts as a national contact point for the prevention, monitoring, coordination of information
and analysis of security incidents within the Public Connectivity Services. It is a governmental CERT which
provides:

1. Proactive services, such as the organization and monitoring of information sources, the production of
newsletters for the members (early warning) and the preparation of operational tools for information
management;

2. Operating activities, such as coordination and information support during the occurrence of cyber in-

cidents;

3. Strategic activity: i.e. the ability to use data collection and analysis aimed at supporting decisions of
the Committee responsible for the coordination of Connectivity Public System (Sistema pubblico di
connettività - SPC) and necessary for improving the overall level of safety of the SPC.

From an operating point of view, the CERT-SPC acts as a central organ of the public administration struc-
ture through the Local Security Unit (Unità Locali di Sicurezza - ULS). The ULS are established in each domain
related to SPC, in conjunction with the Security Operation Center (SOC), and provide access to a federated SPC
network to oversee operational management and service continuity.

At government level, in Italy, in addition to the CERT-SPC and the planned national CERT, there is the CERT

DIFESA which coordinates all army units.

Concerning other CERTs operating in Italy, a complete and updated list is not available. Table 2.2 lists
CERTs reported at the beginning of June 2013 on ENISA website. Such CERTs, however, seem in some cases

Cyber Security Strategy in EU and
Some Developed Countries

The maintenance of a good level of cyber security in the EU context involves disparate sectors with different
jurisdictions and responsibilities, both at national and EU level. Managing cyber security through centralized
supervision at European level is not feasible. National governments have the main responsibility for the main-
tenance of a good level of security and must cooperate at EU level in case of risks and security breaches that
extend beyond national boundaries.

The structures involved in the maintenance of cyber security are organized in three fundamental areas:
Network and Information Security (NIS), law enforcement and defense. At national level member states should
have already, or as a result of the European cyber security strategy, national structures in each of the aforemen-
tioned areas (see ﬁgure 3.1). Member states are responsible for carefully deﬁning the roles and responsibilities
of such national structures.

The European strategy invites member states to encourage information sharing between national struc-
tures involved in cyber security and the private sector, so that they can have both a comprehensive vision of
risks and security threats, and a better comprehension of cyber crime techniques so as to respond more rapidly
and effectively.

Figure 3.1: EU cyber security strategy: Interacting organizations at national and EU level [16].

Several organizations are involved at EU level. In the NIS area, the European Network and Information
Security Agency (ENISA), established in 2004, is responsible for improving network and information security.
Currently a new regulation [15] to strengthen ENISA and modernize its mandate is under examination by the

29

Council of Europe and the European Parliament. ENISA will also be responsible for building expertise in se-
curity of industrial control systems, transport and energy infrastructure. A Computer Emergency Response
Team at EU level (CERT-EU), responsible for the security of the IT systems of EU agencies and institutions, was
established in 2012.

Furthermore, in March 2009, the European Commission established the European Public-Private Partner-
ship for Resilience (EP3R) with the objective of encouraging sharing of NIS related information between inter-
ested parties in the public and private sector at European level. In the area of law enforcement, in 2013, the
European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3) was formed within Europol to represent the European focal point of ﬁght
against cyber crime. In particular, EC3 will provide analysis and intelligence, support investigations, provide
high level forensics and facilitate cooperation and information sharing between the competent authorities of
member states, the private sector and other stakeholders. Europol/EC3 and Eurojust will cooperate closely
to improve their capability in ﬁghting cyber crime. In the area of defense, the main responsibility for cyber
defense at EU level is the European Defence Agency (EDA). The European strategy for cyber security sup-
ports cooperation and information sharing between these organizations, in particular ENISA, Europol/EC3
and EDA, and between these and their counterparts at national level.

Finally, at international level the European Commission and the member states engage in dialogue with
international partners and organizations such as the Council of Europe, OECD, OSCE, NATO and UN. A list of
national cyber security strategies can be found here [19].

3.1 Germany

The German Federal Government provides a substantial contribution to cyber security, maintaining and pro-
moting economic and social prosperity in Germany. The latest German strategy, 2011, mainly focuses on
civilian approaches and measures. These are complemented by the measures undertaken by the armed forces
(Bundeswehr) aimed at protecting its capabilities and measures based on mandates to include cyber security
as part of the preventive security strategy. The global nature of information and communication technologies
raises the necessity for an international vision and coordination on security policy aspects with the aim of
enhancing cyber security capabilities of the international community. For this purpose, Germany cooperates
with the United Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe, Nato, G8, OCSE and other international
organizations.

The German strategic plan is organized in 10 speciﬁc strategic areas:

1. Protection of CII (Critical Information Infrastructure).

CIIs constitutes the central component of almost all critical infrastructure. Thus, protecting such infras-
tructures is the primary objective of cyber security. In order to support CIIs protection the introduction
of new technologies is taken into consideration by the plan. Cooperation and information sharing be-
tween public and private sectors is also a priority.

2. Security of IT systems.

Germany aims to support security of IT systems with an informative intervention, to provide citizens
and small and medium-sized businesses with consistent information concerning risks related to the
use of IT systems, and by promoting the use of fundamental security functions, such as electronic proof
of identity and De-mail1, which are certiﬁed by the state. Furthermore, providers will have to make
available to clients a basic collection of security products and services and might be subject to greater
responsibilities.

3. Strengthening IT security in the public administration.

The German plan for strengthening IT security in the public administration includes the creation of a
common, uniform and secure network infrastructure in the federal administration to serve as the basis
for electronic audio and data communications.

4. Creation of a National Cyber Response Centre.

The National Cyber Response Centre aims to optimize cooperation between state authorities, thus im-
proving response to IT incidents. Information sharing on vulnerabilities, form of attacks and proﬁles of

1De-mail is a German government communication service similar to the Italian certiﬁed e-mail service (Posta Elet-

tronica Certiﬁcata - PEC).

30

attackers allow the National Cyber Response Centre to analyze IT incidents and provide recommenda-
tions for action to be taken in response to incidents. To favor readiness for IT incidents, the National
Cyber Response Centre will submit recommendations to the National Cyber Security Council both reg-
ularly and when speciﬁc incidents occur. In case of cyber security incidents that reach the level of a
crisis the National Cyber Response Centre will directly inform the crisis management staff headed by
the State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior.

5. Creation of a National Cyber Security Council.

The National Cyber Security Council will coordinate preventive tools and the interdisciplinary cyber se-
curity approaches of the public and private sector. Several ministries of the state and representatives of
the federal states (Lãnder) will participate in the council. Representatives from business and academia
will be invited on speciﬁc occasions.

6. Effective crime control in cyberspace.

The German strategic plan envisages the strengthening of the capabilities in ﬁghting cyber crime of law
enforcement agencies, the Federal Ofﬁce for Information Security and the private sector. To deal with
global cyber crime Germany will make an effort to achieve global harmonization in criminal law based
on the Council of Europe Cyber Crime Convention, and will also examine whether new conventions on
cyber crime should be adopted at UN level.

7. Effective coordinated action to ensure cyber security in Europe and worldwide.

The German federal government recognizes the importance to conform to European and international
standards related to cyber security. At European Union level Germany adopts measures based on an
extension and moderate enlargement of the mandate of ENISA. Germany intends to shape its external
cyber security policy so that German interests and ideas concerning cyber security will be pursued by
international organizations, such as United Nations, OSCE, the Council of Europe, OECD and NATO.

8. Use of reliable and trustworthy information technology.

Given the importance of availability and reliability of IT systems, Germany intends to increase research
into IT security and critical information infrastructure protection, in particular, by further developing
its technologies in these areas. Moreover, Germany approves diversity in technology, combining, when
necessary, its own resources alongside those of its partners and allies, favoring the use of technologies
certiﬁed by international standards.

9. Personnel development in federal authorities.

One of the priorities of the Federal government is to examine whether authorities require additional
staff to enhance cyber security. In order to improve inter ministerial cooperation it will favor personnel
exchange between federal authorities, providing appropriate staff training measures.

10. Tools to respond to cyber attacks.

In order to achieve an adequate preparedness against cyber attacks, the German Government recog-
nizes the importance of the creation, in collaboration with the speciﬁc state authorities, of a collection
of tools to effectively respond to cyber attacks.

The objective of the German government is the sustainable implementation of these strategic objectives to
ensure freedom and prosperity in Germany. Technologies used in the area of IT security have short innovation
cycles. Thus, the German Federal Government will periodically verify whether the objectives of the strategic
plan have been achieved, under the control of the National Cyber Security Council, and will conform them, if
necessary, to national and international requirements.

3.2 France

The French president ﬁrst presented the French strategy on defense and national security in June 2008 with
the French White Paper on Defense and National Security. Given the unexpected emergence of cyberspace
in the ﬁeld of national security, in 2009 the government set up the French Network and Information Security
Agency (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information - ANSSI)2. In 2010 the president decided
to give the agency, in addition to its security role, the responsibility for the defense of information systems.
Four strategic objective characterize the French strategy [21]:

2Decree No. 2009-834 of 7 July 2009 creating the French Network and Information Security Agency* (ANSSI).

31

• Becoming a cyber defense world power;

• Safeguarding France’s ability to make decisions through the protection of information related to its

sovereignty;

• Strengthening the cyber security of critical national infrastructures;

• Ensuring security in cyberspace.

In order to reach these objectives, seven area of action have been identiﬁed by the French strategy:

• Effectively anticipate and analyze the environment in order to make appropriate decisions. Monitor
the latest technology developments in order to understand and even anticipate the actions of public or
private actors.

• Detect and block attacks, alert and support potential victims. France is developing detection capability
for attacks on information systems deployed within the ministry networks for enabling the personnel to
be alerted, assess the nature of attacks and create countermeasures. ANSSI has been equipped with an
operations room to meet the challenges.

• Enhance and perpetuate French scientiﬁc, technical, industrial and human capabilities in order to
maintain independence. Driving forward research into cryptology, formal methods and other security-
related areas, creating cyber defense research centers in collaboration with industrial partners. Strategic
investment funds will be provided by the state in order to promote the strengthening of industry.

• Protect the information systems of the nation and of the critical infrastructures to ensure better national
resilience. The French strategy on security products and components has been redeﬁned in order to
take account of France re-joining NATO integrated command. Robust authentication systems will be
integrated in the ministerial networks having a signiﬁcant impact on the level of security. A public-
private partnership will be set up in order to enhance the security of information systems of operators
of critical infrastructures. The operators will beneﬁt from the information gathered by the state on threat
analysis and the State will be able to ensure the appropriate level of protection of the infrastructure that
is crucial to keep the country running properly.

• Adapt French legislation to incorporate technological developments and new practices: new rules to
protect information systems and alert government authorities in case of incidents regarding operators
of electronic communications. Enforcement of the General Security Framework in order to raise the
protection level of the information systems of the public authorities.

• Develop international collaboration initiatives in the areas of information systems security, cyber de-
fense and the ﬁght against cyber crime in order to better protect national information systems: pro-
mote the sharing of essential data (information on vulnerabilities, services, threats) by establishing a
wide network of foreign partners.

• Communicate, inform and raise understanding by the French population of the extent of the challenges
related to information systems security: ensure the awareness and motivation of individuals and orga-
nizations; ANSSI will conduct appropriate communication campaigns targeting the general public and
companies.

3.3 United Kingdom

The UK strategy builds on more than ten years of development. The ﬁrst step was carried out in 2001 by
the Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG). This group recognized the increasing use of online
services required the development of security measures to protect data and recommended the appointment
of a central sponsor for information assurance of government data. Therefore, the government published its
ﬁrst national strategy in 2004, in which a network of Senior Information Risk Owners was established.

In 2009, the government recognized the risk of cyber threats and published its ﬁrst cyber security strategy.
In 2010 the government ranked cyber attacks as a key risk for national security and announced a fund of 650
million pounds for a four-year National Cyber Security Programme. Since 2011 the Cabinet Ofﬁce has been
responsible for cyber security. The most recent strategy was published in 2011 and set out how the government
planned to deliver the National Cyber Security Programme until 2015. Four objectives characterize the strategy
[?]:

32

• Tackling cyber crime and making the UK one of the most secure places in the world to do business;

• Making the UK more resilient to cyber attack and better able to protect its interests in cyberspace;

• Helping shape an open, stable and vibrant cyberspace which the UK public can use safely and which

supports an open society;

• Building the UK’s cross-cutting knowledge, skills and capability to underpin all cyber security objectives.

Six central departments and nine government organizations are responsible for delivery: Home Ofﬁce,
Serious Organized Crime Agency, Child Exploitation and Online Protection, Police Central e-crime Unit, Police
force, National Fraud Authority, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Technology Strategy Board,
UK Trade and Investment, the Cabinet Ofﬁce, the Intelligence and Security Agencies, Ministry of Defense,
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁce.

Concerning critical infrastructure protection in the United Kingdom, everything is delegated to the Centre
for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). CPNI protects national security by providing protective
security advice, in terms of personnel security, physical security and cyber security. CPNI takes into special
consideration the policy context. Policy considerations are one of the building blocks of the mechanism of
protective security advice provided by CPNI. In particular, several government policies inﬂuence CPNI’s work:

• National security strategy: Establishes the strategies aimed at reacting effectively and rapidly to secu-
rity threats, such as: acts of terrorism, attacks on UK cyberspace, natural accidents and disasters and
international military crises that involve the United Kingdom and its allies.

• Strategic defense and security review: Establishes how the objectives of the national security strategy

have to be pursued.

• Counter terrorism strategy: The UK’s counter terrorism strategy is developed in four main directions:
prevent, pursue, protect and prepare. CPNI’s work falls within the “protect” category which aims at
reducing the vulnerability of the UK to terrorist attacks.

• Cyber security strategy (as described above).

• National Risk Register: The National Risk Register is the public version of the conﬁdential National Risk
Assessment that registers the events that may cause damage to people or property, or disruption of es-
sential services. Events are categorized in three broad areas: natural events, major accidents, malicious
attacks.

• Resilience of infrastructure to natural hazards: In order to enhance critical infrastructure and essential
services resilience to disruption due to natural hazard, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat within the
Cabinet Ofﬁce developed the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Programme (CIRP).

CPNI actively cooperates with partners in the public and private sector. In the public sector CPNI works
closely with the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance (CESG) and, within the police, with
the National Counter Terrorism Security Ofﬁce (NaCTSO) and with the Counter Terrorism Security Advisor
(CTSA) network. Government departments are responsible for taking appropriate actions to improve security
in their respective sectors. These departments are also responsible for the identiﬁcation of critical infrastruc-
ture in their sectors in cooperation with CPNI and sector organizations. The departments involved are:

• Department for Business, Innovation and Skills;

• Department of Health;

• Department for Communities and Local Government;

• Department for Transport;

• Home Ofﬁce;

• Department for Energy and Climate Change;

• HM Treasury;

• Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Food Standards Agency;

33

• Cabinet Ofﬁce.

Concerning cyber security, the U.K.’s Government established in 2010 the Cyber Security Operations Cen-
tre (CSOC) and the Ofﬁce of Cyber Security & Information Assurance (OCSIA). CPNI cooperates with CSOC,
OCSIA and CESG in order to conduct the cyber security program for the UK government. In the private sec-
tor, CPNI interacts with the organizations that operate in the national infrastructure. The relationships, es-
tablished over the years, between CPNI’s security advisers and security managers in several sectors enable
information sharing between trusted entities and, when appropriate, sharing of vulnerabilities and effective
response measures in order to improve the protection of the national critical infrastructure and private orga-
nizations. Moreover, CPNI has established a partnership program, Risk Management Delivery Group, which
aims to promote strong links between the principal UK consultancy partners.

3.4 USA

In May 2009, President Obama declared his intention to make cyber security a priority for his administration.
This brought about the publication of a document entitled “Cyber Security Policy Review” (CPR) [47]. In par-
ticular this document identiﬁes 10 short-term actions:

1. Appointment of a cyber security policy ofﬁcial responsible for coordinating the nation’s cyber security

policies and activities.

2. Preparation for the president’s approval of an updated national strategy to secure the information and

communications infrastructure.

3. Designation of cyber security as one of the president’s key management priorities and establishment of

performance metrics.

4. Designation of a privacy and civil liberties ofﬁcial to the NSC cyber security directorate.

5. Conductng interagency-cleared legal analyses of priority cyber security related issues.

6. Initiating a national awareness and education campaign to promote cyber security.

7. Development of an international cyber security policy framework and the strengthening of interna-

tional partnerships.

8. Preparation of a cyber security incident response plan and initiation of a dialogue to enhance public-

private partnerships.

9. Development of a framework for research and development strategies which focuses on game-changing
technologies that have the potential to enhance the security, reliability, resilience, and trustworthiness
of digital infrastructure.

10. Building a cyber security based identity management vision and strategy, and leveraging privacy-enhancing

technologies for the nation.

The achievement of such objectives must respect the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative
(CNCI) [48], launched by President George W. Bush in January 2008, which consists of a set of initiatives aimed
at strengthening US cyber security. President Obama established that CNCI had to be included and extended
in the updated strategy of national cyber security, and that it would play a key role in the realization of the 10
objectives. During the 14 months following the issue of CPR many of the objectives were achieved [46]:

• President Obama appointed a cyber security coordinator at the head of the Cyber Security Directorate
created within the National Security Staff (NSS). This coordinator works closely with the Ofﬁce of Man-
agement and Budget and the Ofﬁce of Science and Technology Policy.

• The Cyber security Directorate started the development of an updated cyber security strategy that ex-

pands and implements the strategy envisaged by CPR and CNCI.

• A continuous and real-time monitoring of federal networks has been introduced, thus enabling faster

detection of vulnerabilities and more effective infrastructure protection.

• According to CPR, a privacy and civil liberties ofﬁcial has been designated within the NSS.

34

• The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) has been released to improve the recruit-
ment, training, and retention of cyber security professionals, to raise public awareness in cyber security,
and to enhance cyber security education by expanding the education programme of CNCI.

• The United States is working to strengthen cooperation and dialogue with international partners. In
cooperation with allied countries, the United States has taken on a leading role in international organi-
zations, such as the United Nations, to make cyber security an international priority.

• The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) has been developed to enable a coordinated na-

tional response to cyber incidents.

• The administration has developed a research and development strategy based on three main themes:
moving targets (systems that change continuously to increase their complexity, thus limiting attackers
and exposition to vulnerabilities), tailored trustworthy spaces (trusted environments that allows the
deﬁnition of tailored requirements) and cyber economic incentives (incentives to adopt appropriate
cyber security solutions for individuals and organizations).

• A draft “National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace” (NSTIC), aimed at reducing cyber secu-

rity vulnerabilities through the use of trusted digital identities, has been released.

With regard to the US roadmap, in February 2013, President Obama issued an executive order to further
improve the management of critical infrastructure cyber security. The aim of this executive order is to establish
a new partnership with the critical infrastructure owners and operators in order to increase cyber security
information sharing and collaboratively develop risk-based standards.

Information sharing on cyber security issues, such as suffered and foiled attacks, threats and vulnerabil-
ities, between the public and private sector is the key factor in the improvement process envisaged by the
executive order. The US government is responsible for improving such exchange of information in terms of
volume, timeliness and quality of information shared with the private sector, thus enabling entities of the pri-
vate sector to better protect themselves against cyber threats. As a result of the executive order the Secretary
of Homeland Security, the Attorney General3 and the Director of National Intelligence will be responsible for
ensuring the timely production of speciﬁc unclassiﬁed reports of cyber threats to the US homeland. Moreover,
classiﬁed reports will be delivered to authorized critical infrastructure entities. The Secretary of Homeland
Security and the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence, will be also re-
sponsible for setting up a system to track the production, dissemination and disposition of the reports. The
aim is to maximize the utility of information sharing related to cyber threats and attacks.

The executive order also addresses the protection of privacy and civil liberties. Important roles in this
context are covered by the Chief Privacy Ofﬁcer and by the Ofﬁcer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (of the
Department of Homeland Security). They are responsible for assessing the privacy and civil liberties risks
of the functions performed by the Department of Homeland Security and for identifying and report ways to
minimize such risks in a publicly available report to be released within one year from the issue of the executive
order. In the production of the report the Chief Privacy Ofﬁcer and the Ofﬁcer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
will consult the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and the OMB.

The executive order issued by President Obama also envisages the creation of a Cyber Security Framework
aimed at reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure. The Secretary of Commerce will direct the Director of
the National Institute of Standard and Technology in the development of the framework. The Cyber Security
Framework will include a collection of standards and procedures to align policy, business and technological
approaches to better address cyber risks. The framework will also include as much as possible industry best
practices and will be available in ﬁnal version by February 2014. The Secretary of Homeland Security will
support the adoption of the framework by the owners and operators of the critical infrastructure and other
interested entities.

3In the federal government of the United States, the Attorney General is a member of the Cabinet and as head of the

Department of Justice is the top law enforcement ofﬁcer and lawyer for the government (Wikipedia).

Analysis of the Italian Cyber Security
Landscape

In order to conduct a deep analysis of the Italian cyber security situation, the Research Center of Cyber Intel-
ligence and Information Security of Sapienza Università di Roma submitted an anonymous questionnaire to
68 organizations sensitive to cyber attacks according to the deﬁnition given in Section 1.3. A successful attack
on any of these organizations would produce an impact that goes beyond the same organizations boundaries
and affects other organizations or society as a whole. A total of 28 fully ﬁlled-in questionnaires were collected.
The organizations targeted by the study where then clustered in four groups on the basis of the organiza-

tion competences and the economic sectors they act within:

• Public Administrations (PA): public administrations are concerned with the implementation of govern-
ment policies at national, regional and local levels. Ministries are examples of central public adminis-
trations. This group includes local administrations (e.g., municipalities), central administrations (e.g.,
ministries) and government agencies;

• (Public) Utilities: any organization which provides services to the general public, although it may be

privately owned, participates to this group. Utilities include electricity, gas, telephone and water;

• Financial: a ﬁnancial organization focuses on dealing with ﬁnancial transactions, such as investments,
loans and deposits. Conventionally, ﬁnancial organizations include banks, trust companies, insurance
companies and investment dealers.

• Industrial: companies that consider their intellectual property, such as patents, data, speciﬁc non-
public management processes, and other conﬁdential information, a critical asset to be protected against
possible attacks. In this study mainly large IT industries and large Italian manufacturing industries were
considered.

The questionnaire was sent to organizations in July 2013, and the results were collected until Septem-
ber 2013. Details about each group are reported in Table 4.1 while Figure 4.1 depicts the category separation
among the returned questionnaires.
Table 4.1 shows that the percentage of ﬁlled-in questionnaires was between 41% and 50% for all groups ex-
cept the ﬁnancial one, which returned only 35% of them. The average percentage of returned questionnaires
was 42,23%. The third column of Table 4.1 reports how many different companies were contacted. Some big
companies (with more than 10.000 employees), in fact, have distinct areas with distinct systems and perhaps
a distinct Coordinator of Information System Security (CISO), and were thus asked to ﬁll-in more than one
single questionnaire.

Organizations of different sizes were contacted in order to better cover the whole Italian landscape. In
particular, among those that returned the questionnaires, 20% of the organizations have up to 1000 employees;
36.7% between 1000 and 10000 employees; 30% between 10000 and 100000 and the remaining 13.3% have
more then 100000 employees. Among the contacted organizations, 50% of them operate only within the Italian
territory while the remaining 50% operate outside of the frontier, at a European or worldwide level. It can also
be observed that at least 75% of the organizations have a central element responsible for security. Taking into
account the sample analyzed, the results presented in the following sections of this chapter are not meant to

have statistical signiﬁcance, especially in terms of groups representativeness. Rather, their aim is to provide a
snapshot of the degree of risk perception and cyber security measures currently implemented in Italy.

4.1 Organization recognition of being a critical infrastructure

It should be noted that only a fraction of the organizations that participated in the analysis consider themselves
to be critical infrastructures. The breakdown of the results on this point are reported in Figure 4.2. The graph
shows that utilities fully recognize their role as critical infrastructure. This result was expected as this group is
recognized as critical by the European Union Directive 2008/114/EC [20].

Half of the PAs recognize themselves critical infrastructure; however, we can further divide this result by
grouping PAs in three subgroups, namely government agencies, central administrations and local adminis-
trations and then analyzing the awareness at this ﬁner level of detail. As Figure 4.3 shows, a large fraction of
government agencies and central administrations, consider themselves as critical infrastructure, while local
administrations acknowledge that a failure of their services caused by cyber attacks would probably have a
limited impact from a national standpoint. The industrial group reported a mixed level of awareness; sub-
dividing group results, it is possible to see that companies that responded afﬁrmatively to the question usually
provide fundamental services to other organizations that manage the critical infrastructure. Other companies
were mainly targeted as they manage important intellectual assets that should be protected from cyber attacks;
however, these organizations do not consider the protection of these assets as a national problem necessary
for defending Italian economic interests.

Finally, it is important to underline the fact that almost none of the organizations pertaining to the ﬁnan-
cial group recognized themselves as critical infrastructure. This could be seen as a consequence of the fact

that the ﬁnancial system is not ofﬁcially considered as a critical infrastructure at the European level. However,
recent facts (e.g. the Lehman Brothers crack or the Royal Bank of Scotland IT failure [50]) clearly show how se-
vere failures of ﬁnancial organizations may easily have a broad impact at both the national and international
level. This latter aspect, in fact, has been recognized by two of the ﬁnancial organizations that participated in
the survey.

4.2 External dependencies

The questionnaire contained some questions to asses the existence of organizational inter-dependencies with
third parties. The ﬁrst question of the set was, “Is your company using (or planning to use) cloud services?”
Figure 4.4 shows the distribution of responses. A majority of the respondents use cloud services in their or-
ganization. The responses breakdown (shown in the left side of the ﬁgure) reports similar behavior with the
exception of ﬁnancial players that use cloud services less than companies belonging to other group.

The next question aimed at understanding if such cloud services support core business processes that are
necessary to deliver critical services. Answers to this question are depicted in Figure 4.5. A sizable share of the

interviewed companies did not answer this question; this is due to the fact that the question is strictly related
to the previous one. A key point is that there is a signiﬁcant part of respondents (18%) that use cloud services
to support their core business and to deliver critical services. This percentage is fairly similar for all groups,
except the ﬁnancial one where no organization brings critical services in the cloud.

Continuing the evaluation of external dependencies, the questionnaire included the following question,
“Is it possible that an ICT service failure in one (or more) third-party company will have a signiﬁcant impact
on your company?” Results are reported in Figure 4.6. In this case a majority of the organizations answered
afﬁrmatively, indicating that they depend on an external ICT system. Only a small fraction (11%) is free from
this kind of dependency. Another 11% does not know if a failure of a third-party ICT system could impact its
organization.

The next question asked, “Do you know if your software providers are following a strategic approach to
address application risks in each phase of the application development process?” In this way it was possible
to evaluate if the strategy behind externalization of software development takes into account security aspects.
The majority of respondents (Figure 4.7)does not know if their software providers follow a speciﬁc approach
to address application risks. 50% of respondents think that their providers probably implement some sort
of security strategy during the development phases. Only 14% is certain about the conduct of their software
providers.

4.3 Anomalies and cyber attacks

Figure 4.8 reports the percentage of organizations, divided by group, which regularly register anomalies. Anoma-
lies refer to events that are not cyber attacks but that go beyond the normal behavior of the organization infras-
tructure. It was revealed that utilities are the organizations that record the maximum number of anomalies. All
the interviewed organizations belonging to this group acknowledged the presence of anomalies within their
systems. On the contrary, the ﬁnancial group seems to be the one that is least affected by such events (67%),
followed by the public administration (77%) and then the industrial group (80%).

Figure 4.9 shows the percentage of interviewed organizations that have been subject to cyber attacks con-
ducted by insiders. This could be an employee or any contract or staff member (e.g. cleaner, caterer, security
guard) who has authorized access to the organization premises. The utility group is clearly a common target
for these kind of attacks. Indeed, 50% of the interviewed organizations conﬁrmed that they have been targeted
by an insider at least once. However, it is worth noticing that this group is also the one that best responded
to these threats. None of the reported attacks, in fact, were successful. On the contrary, ﬁnancial and public
administration have been hit by successful internal attacks. In particular, in the ﬁnancial group, half of the
tentative internal attacks were successful, while one attack in four against the public administration achieved
its target. Interviewed companies in the industrial group did not declare any attack conducted by insiders.
Many studies are now analyzing how to increase the employees trustworthiness (e.g., [4]).

Figure 4.9: Question #1.1.5 - Companies that have been attacked by an insider (per group).

Figure 4.10 reports the percentage of organizations that have been the target of an external cyber attack per
group. By analyzing the data, it can be seen that all ﬁnancial organizations have been attacked and attacks have
been successful in 17% of cases. The public administration group is the one exhibiting the highest number of
successful attacks 62%. Probably, this is an indicator of poor security policies. Conversely, the industrial group
is the least attacked. Indeed, only 40% of the interviewed companies have been attacked, and half of the attacks
were successful. The aim of the external attacks is reported in Figure 4.11.

From the chart, it is clear that ﬁnancial organizations are attacked in order to subtract data, impair the
availability of their services and to tamper with data. Protest is by far the main motivation for attacks that target
the public administration. Surprisingly, utilities do not declare attacks aimed at impairing service availability
while industrial group does not suffer protest attacks.

lecting none, one or more countermeasures to ﬁght internal misuse. Thus, Figure 4.12 depicts as a percentage
the number of times a given countermeasure has been selected by the respondents with respect to the total
number of countermeasures selected by all respondents. The two most common measures implemented are
employee training and information classiﬁcation/access control policies (both more than 30%). Restrictions
on the use of personal emails and/or cloud services from the inside of the organization’s network and restricted
use of personal equipment are both 15%.

The adoption rate of each reported measure was also computed. Adoption rates were additionally com-
puted per group. For example, 100% adoption of a measure m (e.g. employee training) in a group means that
all organizations belonging to that group implement m. Figure 4.13 shows adoption rate for each countermea-
sure and for each group. Results show that the PA group focuses on classiﬁcation and employee training, al-
most neglecting other measures. The ﬁnancial and industrial groups are more willing to adopt other measures
such as restricting the access of personal mail or cloud services and forbidding the use of personal equipment
at work. Utilities consider training of employees as the main measure and there is a high percentage of them
that restrict use of email/cloud. Finally it should be pointed out that one of the primary measures for counter-
acting internal misuse, employee training, is also perceived by the respondents as one of the things that they
can/would like to improve in order to better protect their organization (See Section 4.7).

Defense from external threats

One section of the questionnaire was designed to assess the security measures implemented. Speciﬁcally, if
the organization has measures to detect active attacks (see Figure 4.14). 71% of the organizations declare they
own an IT infrastructure which is able to detect simple attacks. The remaining 29% of the organizations declare
they own an IT infrastructure that is capable of detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs1). This percentage
of basic setups is 85% for the PA and 80% for the industrial group. 75% of the organizations belonging to the
utilities group declares they own an IT infrastructure able to detect APTs.

Given the widespread adoption of web applications, all respondents claimed to use web applications to
support their business, the survey asked about their security assessment. The results are presented in Figure
4.15. Roughly half of the respondents do not test their web application for security, at least not using standard
and well established methodologies. The situation is common to all groups with slightly better results for
ﬁnancial and utilities groups. Testing of web applications is a key point for the security of a company, since
such applications have been proven as a high risk target for attacks.

Figure 4.16 reports results about the diffusion of penetration testing methodologies. Overall, 80% of the
participants actively test their systems and 47% of the respondents rely on an external company to assess the
security of their infrastructure. Examining the individual groups, it can be seen that the PA group is the one
which executes the least active testing with roughly 35% of respondents admitting to not running any form
of penetration testing. The ﬁnancial group is characterized by 83% of the penetration tests being executed
by external companies while utilities reach a balance of 50% between internal and external penetration test
activities. All organizations in both groups declare to execute such activity.

chart depicts the overall picture.

Figure 4.17 shows measures that can be used to block the spread of an attack. It is clear that the majority
of participants (in all groups) have some form of protection to prevent an attack spreading. In detail, the sum
of network segmentation and IDs constitutes 94% of the adopted measures, a ratio that is maintained group
by group, while different measures are adopted by just 5% of the participants.

As a ﬁnal point, the capabilities of an organization to mitigate the effect of an attack was investigated.
(Question #1.5.1 “Do you have processes and resources to respond to cyber security incidents?”). Results are
in Figure 4.18. The PA group was the only one to admit that some of them, 25%, do not have the capabilities to
respond to a cyber security incident. The utilities group claims to be autonomous with 100% of the interviewed
believing that they can cope with a cyber security incident. The ﬁnancial group responds to cyber security
incidents mainly with internal resources (67%) while the opposite is true for industrial group where 60% of
resources are external.

4.5 Recovery capabilities

A set of questions to assess the capacity of an organization to recover from a signiﬁcant cyber security incident
was designed into the questionnaire (Figure 4.19). The majority of respondents in the PA group are quite con-
ﬁdent about the possibility to recover from a cyber attack. Financial and utilities groups also share a very high
percentage of positive answers. This conﬁdence decreases for other groups arriving at a minimum for the in-
dustrial group, in which 40% of the respondents admit to not having the capabilities to autonomously recover
from a signiﬁcant attack. This is probably due to the fact that PA recovery is (most of the times) operationally
simpler than in other groups where recovering a service could take much more time due to potentially longer
supply chains.

Figure 4.20 refers to the adoption of a disaster recovery plan per group. It can be noticed that the ﬁnan-
cial and utilities groups seem to be those that most perceived the necessity of such a plan. Indeed, all the
companies in these groups already have a disaster recovery plan, or are going to implement one. Not all the
public administration group, instead, has a disaster recovery plan or the intention to implement one in the
near future, regardless of the legislative constraints they are subject to. Surprisingly, 25% of the interviewed
companies in the industrial group seem not to be interested in disaster recovery.

Figure 4.21 reports the distribution of the seven tiers of disaster recovery [35] among the companies that
currently implement it. It can be noticed that more than 50% of the companies implement a Tier 4 disaster
recovery plan, that assures a fast recovery time. More than 17% implement the highest available tier, which
allows little or no data loss.

4.6 Policies

One section of the survey was targeted at assessing the adoption of policies by respondents. They were asked
about the adoption of speciﬁc policies (ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27005:2008, ISACA Risk it) for security and risk
management, and about the adoption of an Information Security Management System (ISMS). Roughly half
of the respondents implement some form of ISMS (see Figure 4.22). The same result is evident for the single
groups. Public administration and industrial groups show the lowest adoption of ISMS. The utility and ﬁnan-
cial groups are the ones with the widest adoption (above 75%). For the ISO/IESC 27001 standard, adoption is
greater in the industrial and ﬁnancial ﬁelds and less in the utilities and PA groups. Results are shown in Figure
4.23.

The scenario changes when asked about the adoption of an Operator Security Plan, a measure that is
requested by the European Council Directive 2008/114/EC. In this case the overall situation shows a general
adoption by 18% of the interviewed companies. This standard is largely adopted by organizations belonging
to the utilities group (50%). For the other groups, the standard is adopted by a number of organizations that is
always less than or equal to 20% (see Figure 4.24). Finally respondents were asked if they keep their Operator
Security Plan updated. The outcome of this question is reported in Figure 4.25).

4.7 How organizations would like to improve their security

The questionnaire contained a few questions aimed at assessing security measures organizations feel they
should adopt in order to improve their cyber security. Figure 4.26 shows how the highest percentage of the
respondents (31%) ask for better policies or a strict implementation of the existing policies; this is followed by
the request for improved security tools and a basic security training for employees. Nevertheless, Figure 4.26
points out there is no large gap among measures that could improve organization security.

Figure 4.26: Question #1.5.4. - “Do you think that the security of your company could be improved with:
(i) Better security policies, or strict implementation of the existents, (ii) More ICT security experts / security
expert with expertise conformity externally tested, (iii) Improved security tools, (iv) Security focused training
of all the employees with regard to their duties, (v) Security audit periodically executed by an external certiﬁed
organization”. Left chart shows answer distribution by group. Right chart depicts the overall picture.

The utilities group seems to have a high sensibility for policies adoption and implementation (75% of re-
spondents ask for this) and for the request of better security tools (75% of respondents); these two demands
are followed by better security training for employees and the presence of more security experts; for the ﬁnan-
cial group, the request for employees’ training is comparable to the request for security experts, and it is worth
noticing that 100% of the respondents belonging to this group asked for better policies; security auditing is
seen as something that can improve security by the industrial group. Respondents of utilities and ﬁnancial
group does not even mention this measure. The PA group thinks auditing, security experts and tools could
improve the security of their organizations, furthermore policies are seen by the widest majority of the group

50

as something that could enhance security. Last but not least, note that all groups strongly believe in better
policies as a way to improve their security.

4.8 A cyber security readiness index

Analyzing the questionnaire answers, various aspects related to the cyber security habits of the organizations
were assessed. To this aim, a score system that evaluates the answers to a subset of questions in the ques-
tionnaire was designed. The evaluation is based on four indexes: awareness, defense, policy and external
independency.

The cyber security readiness index is a composite measure of the capacity and willingness of an organi-
zation to face cyber threats. A nice cyber security habit for an organization is considered to be the one which
is able to cover the largest area on a radar chart taking into account the four indexes. Thus the cyber security
readiness index reﬂects the dimension of this area. The complete structure of the score system that computes
the cyber security readiness index based on the four indexes is reported in Appendix B.

Awareness index - Assesses the situational awareness related to cyber risks of the organization and it is inﬂu-
enced by the majority of the questions in the survey (see appendix B); as an example positive responses
to questions like, “Does your company regularly register anomalies? For anomalies we mean an event
that is not a cyber-attack but is outside the normal behavior of the company infrastructure” (Question
#1.3.10) and, “If so, the average number of these anomalies during last year is: [...]” (Question #1.3.11)
inﬂuence negatively the awareness score since the presence of a frequent anomalous event in an orga-
nization network should be carefully analyzed in order to exclude the presence of sophisticated attacks.
On the contrary, the awareness score is inﬂuenced positively when responses to questions show behav-
ior which is cyber security aware; one example is the question, “Do you know if your software providers
are following a strategic approach to address application risks in each phase of the application develop-
ment process?” (Question #1.2.6); a positive response to this question shows a careful consideration of
the risks that could derive from bad software design processes.

Defense index - Assesses the capacity of an organization to protect itself from a cyber attack. This consid-
ered the evaluation of the defense mechanisms and tools employed by an organization. An example
of a question that inﬂuences positively this index is, “Which of the following measures to protect data
and critical systems from misuse by employees does your company implement?” (Question #1.4.8); no
answer to this question inﬂuences negatively both the awareness and defense index; on the contrary,
a response like, “Restrict the use of personal emails and cloud services" has a slightly positive score on
the defense index; the response, “Forbid the use of personal electronic equipment (laptop, smartphone,
tablet)" has a signiﬁcant positive impact on the defense score. Notice that the defense index is some-
what correlated with the awareness index. Some responses that positively impact the defense index,
also impact the awareness index. This correlation is well-grounded since the implementation of strong
defense mechanisms shows cyber security awareness.

Policy index - Assesses the implementation of security related policies. A high score in this index shows com-
pliance to several security policies and their constant update. This index is inﬂuenced positively by
Questions #1.4.1, # 1.4.2, # 1.4.3, # 1.4.6 and # 1.4.7. As an example Question # 1.4.7 asks, “Do you use
an Operator Security Plan or an equivalent measure, as deﬁned in the Council Directive 2008/114/EC
of 8 December 2008?"; an afﬁrmative response positively inﬂuences the index. As for the defense index
there is a strong correlation of the policy index with the awareness index since the adoption of updated
security policies show an increased awareness.

External independency index - Assesses the correlation between internal systems and external providers. A
low score on this index shows the correlation of the organization mechanism to external providers since
the fault of an external cloud provider could impact on its possibility to deliver the core product of
its business. As an example the Question #1.2.2 that asks, “Do cloud services support core business
processes that are necessary to deliver critical services?” with a negative answer would increases the
external independency score. A high score on this index shows an organization that relies minimally on
external services that could impact on its security. Note that such high scores imply larger operational
costs as the organization has to insource software services without the involvement of third parties.

Figure 4.28: Question #1.5.3 - “Do you have situational awareness on the state of cyber threats to your organi-
zation?"(per group)

A radar chart is depicted in Figure 4.27 showing the results of the cyber security readiness index per group.
As expected, the utility group covers the largest area in the ranking. It scores better than other groups along
two axes, namely defense and policy. It has also a high score on awareness. Nevertheless, it suffers from a
low external independence; this problem is shared by all the other groups, with the exception of the ﬁnancial
group that seems still reluctant to heavily rely on external service providers.

The ﬁnancial group also exhibits a large covered area in the radar chart by showing high values for external
independency, defense and awareness indexes. Surprisingly it does not score as expected on policy index.
However, keep in mind that some of the questions that inﬂuence the policy index (e.g., question # 1.4.7) are
related to the speciﬁc policy imposed by the EU directive 2008/114/EC on European Critical Infrastructure that
ﬁnancial organizations are not obliged to comply with.

The industrial group is the third one in the ranking, showing a high level of awareness and a good defense
index while lagging behind in policy adoption. The PA group shows a low degree of cyber security readiness
with respect to the other groups; indeed, the area covered by the radar plot is the smallest among all the groups.
It has by far the lowest indexes on policy, defense and awareness.

It is interesting to compare the awareness index with the answers to question #1.5.3, that is, “Do you have

situational awareness on the state of the cyber threat to your organization?" (Figure 4.28). It can be pointed
out that the greatest value of the awareness index (see awareness axis in Figure 4.27) is scored by the industry,
ﬁnancial and utility groups. They actually share the same score. However, the perception that organizations
belonging to these three groups have is quite different: the awareness declared by respondents from industry
is very high while that declared by ﬁnancial is 13% smaller. A similar argument can be used for the PA group.
While the PA group seems to be quite well aware of the cyber security landscape (54% of the answers were
positive in Figure 4.28), its awareness index is much smaller than the ones sported by the other groups. The
utility group, instead, declares good situational awareness and its awareness index conﬁrms this.

As last interesting note the PA group was disaggregated into government agencies, central administrations
and local administrations and the cyber security readiness index for each sub group was computed. Results
are shown in Figure 4.29 where the dotted line represents the group average. It can be seen that government
agencies have better scores for policy index and external independency. This can be due to the fact that they
have small information systems compared to central and local administrations, thus allowing for a more in-
house approach. Local and central administrations show roughly the same area.

Recommendations for a National
Cyber Security Strategy

The aim of a national cyber security strategy is to increase the global resilience and security of national ICT
assets that support critical functions of the state or of the society as a whole [17]. Setting clear objectives and
priorities is of paramount importance for successfully achieving this aim. In order to manage risk in a proper
way, it is necessary to design an effective risk management process by identifying what could go wrong (iden-
tiﬁcation of risk), evaluating which risks should be dealt with (risk analysis and evaluation), and implementing
strategies to deal with those risks, preventing or detecting all situations of risk, and implementing the adequate
response. The UK is an example of a country which followed a risk management approach to implement a na-
tional strategy [49].

In the following, a risk management process (see Figure 5.1) is used as a useful paradigm to frame some
recommendations for setting an effective national cyber security strategy for Italy. These recommendations do
not aspire to be a complete set of rules to be followed, but rather they represent a set of points that we believe
the national strategy on cyber security should take into account. Recommendations consider the legislative
scenario, experiences from other countries, and results of the questionnaire. The target of these recommenda-
tions are in general all companies and PAs that manage or control critical infrastructures, security profession-
als working in economic sectors sensitive to cyber attacks and all government agencies and bodies involved in
the deﬁnition and implementation of the Italian cyber security strategy.

Risk AssessmentIdentiﬁcationAnalysisEvaluationRisk TreatmentPreventionDetectionResponseRecovery5.1 Recommendations for risk assessment

One of the key elements of a national cyber security strategy is the risk assessment process. It consists of three
steps [18]:

Risk identiﬁcation - identiﬁcation of important assets/organizations/sectors and main sources of risk;

Risk analysis - determining the likelihood that a potential vulnerability can be exploited and the impact
that the threat could have on a critical economic sector;

Risk evaluation - taking decisions about (i) the signiﬁcance of risks for a critical economic sector and
(ii) whether each speciﬁc risk should be accepted or treated.

Risk assessment can provide valuable information for developing, executing and evaluating a strategy. By
carrying out a nationwide risk assessment process and by aligning the objectives of the strategy with national
security needs, it is possible to focus on the most important challenges with regard to cyber security. In order
to develop correct risk identiﬁcation at national level it is important to clearly deﬁne and identify: critical
economic sectors, cyber threats and vulnerabilities. A list of recommendations for risk assessment follows.

Understanding the dimension of cyber threats

Most of the events that can harm a critical economic sector sensitive to cyber threats are due to failures or
human mistakes happening both in the physical and the cyber world that then propagate and escalate through
the cyber world. Therefore, attackers exploiting vulnerabilities of an information system for damaging, for
example, a national critical infrastructure are just one side of the coin. Failures and cyber attacks have to be
studied and analyzed in the same framework (e.g. mitigation, inter-dependencies and awareness strategies)
in order to make the economic sector infrastructure more dependable.

Identify priorities within critical economic sectors

A key aspect in have a compelling security strategy is to clearly identify priorities in the protection of critical
economic sectors (including national critical infrastructure). As a matter of fact, it is not possible to ensure
the same degree of protection to all systems. Therefore, it is important to give higher priority to those systems
which have a greater impact on national security. At the same time, all economic sectors should be protected
with at least a minimum level of security.

Understanding attackers’ habits

To establish a national cyber security priority for defending services of critical economic sectors that underpin
our society and economy, there is the need to understand the habit of attackers, their targets, their strategies
and their methodologies. Thus a risk framework must reﬂect such factors, that is to say the key assets or func-
tions of economic sectors that could be targeted by criminals, hacktivists, and state-sponsored organizations
and potential avenues for attack or exploitation. This process involves understanding what motivates cyber
threat actors, and the classiﬁcation of cyber threats.

Taking critical economic sector infrastructure inter-dependencies into account

In section 4.2 it was shown that almost 50% of the protagonists in the Italian panorama are going to use third
party solutions. Moreover, 80% of them know they depend on failures suffered by third party companies. The
priorities and security baselines should consider of paramount importance the dependency relations among
critical infrastructures and assign appropriate priorities according to their level of dependency, e.g. if the cor-
rect functioning of a system is mandatory for more than one critical infrastructure, that system must have a
higher level of priority, with respect to assets that depend on it. Ranking of threats in the national strategy has
to be addressed taking into account the implications for critical economic sectors, including the theft of sen-
sitive data, damage to business or operational systems, disruption of services, and other scenarios that could
result in substantial ﬁnancial loss and compromise public safety or national security. Appropriate risk analysis
techniques should be adopted to proﬁle the threat.

56

Cooperative assessment of threats and vulnerabilities

Cyber threats have to be faced keeping in mind a global and unifying perspective. This is necessary since
threats nowadays range from low-level attacks of small complexity executed by unskilled adversaries to so-
phisticated attacks executed from sparse geographical locations by groups of skilled adversaries with a huge
number of resources. Coordination and cooperation are fundamental in order to identify threats and to reach
an effective protection of critical economic sectors1. Service providers working in similar sectors (e.g. utili-
ties) share similarities both in the assets used to deliver critical services (e.g., similar SCADA systems) and in
organizational aspects (i.e. similar security policies). They are therefore likely to share the same weaknesses
as well. Cooperation among service providers of the same sector should be fostered also through an appro-
priate legislative framework. Incentives should be given to balance the fact that such providers are usually
competitors on open markets. As an example, the US Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) could
be a good starting point (http://www.isaccouncil.org/). Beneﬁts of a cooperative approach have been deeply
investigated in [3].

Nationwide methodology for threat classiﬁcation

In order to effectively enforce an active cooperative scenario there is the need to develop a national method-
ology for classifying threats and decide at which level threats must be faced: at the single organization level,
at the sector level, at the regional level, at the national level. In order to effectively protect national critical
infrastructure and strategic economic sectors this is a very sensitive issue. Taking the wrong decision in such
a classiﬁcation could either underestimate or overestimate the threat. In the former case, the threat might not
be blocked and thus spread through the economic sector infrastructure while in the latter case, false alarms
are generated that, if not appropriately limited, could make all the protection process inefﬁcient. Note that
millions of threats against an infrastructure could be deployed in cyberspace in a few seconds; overestimation
could thus hamper the whole process by disrupting the trustworthiness of the security strategy as a whole.

Clear guidelines governing how risks are accepted and documented

Risk evaluation is used to decide the signiﬁcance of risks to organizations and whether each speciﬁc risk should
be accepted or treated. Since it is impossible to mitigate all risks, frameworks for national risk developed under
the parameters of the national strategy should include clear guidelines governing how risks are accepted and
documented. Guidelines should also specify when an economic sector is so vital that a higher standard of
protection is needed.

5.2 Recommendations for risk treatment

As shown in Figure 5.1, risk treatment includes the following:

Risk prevention - All categories of management and of technical and operational activities that en-
able the decision of appropriate outcome-based actions to ensure adequate protection against threats.
When adequate preventive protection mechanisms are in place, implemented via physical or logical
protection, it is possible to identify and activate the detection mechanisms.

Risk detection - All activities identifying (through ongoing monitoring or other means of observation)
the presence of cyber threats, and the processes to assess the potential impact of those threats.

Risk response - Responding to a signiﬁcant threat (i.e. deciding on the appropriate courses of action to
accept, avoid or mitigate the threat) through a risk response plan;

Risk recovery - Once an incident is detected and validated, some actions should follow. They generally
include (i) stopping an ongoing incident, (ii) identifying the scope and scale of incident, (iii) limiting
damage, (iv) taking measures in order to investigate the course of events and (v) preventing the incident
from recurring.

A set of recommendations for risk treatment follow.

183% of positive answers to question #2.0.1 “Do you think that cooperation among companies of your sector should

be enforced by government legislation?”

Clear role and mission for the national CERT

As remarked in Section 2.2, Italy has recorded a signiﬁcant delay in setting up a national CERT. Although the
realization of the national CERT has been introduced by the Legislative Decree 28 May 2012, n. 70 complying
with the transposition of Directive 2009/140/EC, to the best of our knowledge a national CERT is still not op-
erating. Moreover, CERT’s operative role within the national cyber security strategy is still not clear. Having an
operative national CERT with a clear mission and role is the basic building block of any national cyber security
strategy.

To work properly, a CERT needs the participation of numerous public and private sector actors, with clear
terms of participation. Following the example of many other countries (including the USA), the Italian CERT
should be deeply connected with the academic world, which can provide the most innovative solutions in
the ﬁeld of secure information, and that is institutionally committed to research and training activities. Apart
from its traditional tasks, as remarked in some of the recommendations of Section 5.1, the national CERT
needs to clearly deﬁne the guidelines that have to be used to classify threats, their criticality level, and the
corresponding sensitivity level. By making use of this classiﬁcation, it should be possible to clearly distinguish
between national, regional and local incidents. This is a priority given the number of players, bodies and
boards that have a role within the Italian cyber security landscape as designated by the DPCM of 24 March
2013 (see the last paragraph of Section 2.1).

The national CERT should also have the role of coordinating with other CERTs operating in Italy and being
the Italian interface for EU and international CERTs. As already remarked in Section 2.2, in June 2012 ENISA
listed Italian CERTs. This list also included some inactive CERTs and other CERTs which do not show any
information on activities they actually perform.

Set clear deﬁnitions and procedures for incident response

The national CERT will have to provide detailed, timely and accurate information about potential threats that
may damage the national critical infrastructure and sensitive economic sectors. This will be possible only by
deﬁning clear procedures and plans that have to be followed by all the private and public organizations that
will collaborate with the national CERT. For such a reason, the national strategy should clearly deﬁne the coop-
eration and coordination procedures that have to be followed. In particular, high-level goals, objectives, and
priorities have to be established and shared with all the organizations involved. Furthermore, it is important
to address all the problems related to the information sharing of attacks and discovered vulnerabilities. In this
process, organizations need to be guaranteed that only the essential information about security incidents are
disclosed to third parties.

Cooperative early threat and vulnerability warning dissemination

When a new threat (e.g. vulnerability, malware, etc) is discovered in the information systems of an organi-
zation, an early dissemination of this information to all interested national actors is mandatory in order to
properly protect their own organization infrastructure. The dissemination has to be done within a legislative
scenario which ensures the organization disseminating the threat is not legally liable. The early warning may
allow system administrators to take countermeasures in order to mitigate or monitor possible attacks. Thus
the institution of an Italian actor that is in charge of managing a National Vulnerability Database is of national
interest for improving the protection of national assets and, therefore, is strongly encouraged. Furthermore,
an international standard such as Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) framework should be adopted
in order to push towards a simple interaction with international partners.

Promote dissemination activities and enhance education skills

Fostering awareness among the population is a priority. No national strategy for cyber security can be imple-
mented without a plan for dissemination activities such as newspaper articles and debates in the mass media
to increase awareness of ordinary people not necessarily involved in the protection of critical resources. Con-
veying an appropriate message to ordinary people on the risk connected to Internet-use at the personal and
community level has to be a long lasting objective. In addition to raising the level of awareness of ordinary
people, there is the need to develop specialized skills in, and knowledge of, cyber security in universities and

58

research centers. This will lead to the creation of a new class of cyber security experts needed by private and
public organizations and research.

5.3 Further recommendations

Research, development and technology investments

Due to the strategic nature of cyber security for a nation, we cannot outsource these competences to other
countries but it is imperative to consolidate and possibly increase domestic competence in creating and de-
ploying security technologies. Cyber security can be considered as a giant economic opportunity for Italy. The
presence in Italy of key sector players, high-tech SMEs and highly reputed research centers makes Italy a breed-
ing grounds for cyber security initiatives that could be a source of employment and wealth for the current and
next generations. Thus, it is important for a nation to have a research and technology agenda to promote ad-
vances in research and high-tech development. This investment needs to be done immediately. It is not clear
if the situation will continue to be like this ten years from now. Additionally, appropriate investment is nec-
essary for keeping the best researchers in this ﬁeld in Italy, so contributing to ensure national independence
from information technology related risks.

International engagements

Efforts made in improving the protection of national critical economic sectors cannot be made in isolation
with respect to the rest of the world because cyber threats intrinsically cross borders. As an example, an at-
tacker can destroy a critical infrastructure of a nation while sitting on a sofa ten thousands kilometers from the
attacked place. Thus a defense cannot be only on the perimeter, but there is the need of international collab-
orations and networking. Cooperation among national CERTs is deﬁnitely expected as well as cooperation at
the political and law enforcement level with the signature of appropriate bilateral or multilateral agreements.
Another important point is to set up a clear and agreed worldwide governance of Internet that will be able to
make cyberspace a more regulated place.

Critical economic sector organizations should adopt solid risk management processes

Risk management processes helps organizations determine what assets need protection, the threats they re-
quire protection against and the controls. The evaluation helps categorize risks by severity and involves mak-
ing cost-effective decisions on what needs protection. The process helps organizations to ensure that efforts
and investments on security yield cost effective beneﬁts. Good risk management processes recognize that
organizations have different business requirements, structures and operational environments. The process
deﬁnes broad requirements allowing organizations to decide the most cost effective and efﬁcient risk man-
agement approaches (ISO/IEC 2008). Effective risk management requires a reporting and review structure to
ensure that risks are effectively identiﬁed and assessed and that necessary countermeasures and responses
are put in place. Making sure that a critical economic sector equips itself with an adequate risk governance
process allows to delegate part of the controlling activities to infrastructure owners and operators. The latter
has a comprehensive and deeper understanding of the speciﬁc needs and characteristics of their systems.

Last but not least, audit activities of critical economic sector infrastructure by external entities is good
practice and has to be encouraged. As an example, Figure 4.16 shows that 47% of the interviewed actively au-
dits security levels using external companies. However, organizations still need internal audits or a coordinator
of information system security. Cyber security needs clear roles and responsibilities: experts with appropriate
skills, authority, and resources to develop security baselines and to satisfy security regulation requirements.
This is recommended for all sectors, from government owned organizations to privately owned ones.

Reducing the supply chain risk

This can be done by (i) studying all the supply chain of vendors of products and services employed within
the economy, (ii) improving the visibility of the supply chain and building relationships of trust between ven-
dors of products and services and infrastructure providers, (iii) improving the compliance with international
standards and having laboratories where such compliance is tested.

59

A national agency for cyber security

Ensuring cyber security for a nation is a duty that cannot disregard good technology skills and competences.
Any government organization that is involved in the national cyber security strategy thus needs to have such
skills in-house and its governance needs to be aware of and able to assess cyber and information technology
risks. The latter point is critical because if an organization’s governance does not have appropriate technology
competences, it will either overestimate or underestimate a threat or simply not understanding what is going
on. This is why many countries, including France, Israel, Germany, Holland, to cite just a few, decided to con-
verge all activities related to cyber security inside a single organization which most of the time is within the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers of its own country (e.g. National Cyber Bureaux in Israel, Federal Of-
ﬁce for Information Security in Germany, Network and Information Security Agency in France, National Cyber
Security Centre in the Netherlands etc.). We cannot indeed expect that the necessary skills and competences
also at governance level can be found in many government organizations and agencies. Additionally when
decisions have to be taken about facing a threat, these decisions have to be fast and sharp. The same is true for
coordination activities. All of this calls for a national agency for cyber security that empowers procedures, pro-
cesses and coordination activities actually being the main agent for implementing the national cyber security
strategy to make the national cyberspace a safe place.

Appendix A: Questionnaire

In order to conduct a deep analysis of the Italian cyber security situation, the Research Center of Cyber Intel-
ligence and Information Security of Sapienza Università di Roma submitted an anonymous questionnaire to
68 organizations sensitive to cyber attacks according to the deﬁnition given in Section 1.3. A successful attack
on any of these organizations would produce an impact that goes beyond the same organizations boundaries
and affects other organizations or society as a whole. A total of 28 fully ﬁlled-in questionnaires were collected.
