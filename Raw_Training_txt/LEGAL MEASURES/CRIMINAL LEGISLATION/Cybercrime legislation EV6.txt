Purpose 
The purpose of the ITU report Understanding Cybercrime: Phenomena, Challenges and Legal Response is 
to  assist  countries  in  understanding  the  legal  aspects  of  cybersecurity  and  to  help  harmonize  legal 
frameworks. As such, the report aims to help developing countries better understand the national and 
international  implications  of  growing  cyberthreats,  to  assess  the  requirements  of  existing  national, 
regional and international instruments, and to assist countries in establishing a sound legal foundation.  
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the most relevant topics linked to the legal aspects of 
cybercrime and focuses on the demands of developing countries. Due to the transnational dimension of 
cybercrime,  the  legal  instruments  are  the  same  for  developing  and  developed  countries.  However,  the 
references used were selected for the benefit of developing countries, in addition to a broad selection of 
resources  provided  for  a  more  in-depth  study  of  the  different  topics.  Whenever  possible,  publicly 
available sources were used, including many free-of-charge editions of online law journals.  
The report contains six main chapters. After an introduction (Chapter 1), it provides an overview of the 
phenomena  of  cybercrime  (Chapter  2).  This  includes  descriptions  of  how  crimes  are  committed  and 
explanations of the most widespread cybercrime offences such as hacking, identity theft and denial-of-
service  attacks.  An  overview  of  the  challenges  is  also  provided,  as  they  relate  to  the  investigation  and 
prosecution of cybercrime (Chapters 3 and 4). After a summary of some of the activities undertaken by 
international and regional organizations in the fight against cybercrime (Chapter 5), it continues with an 
analysis  of  different  legal  approaches  with  regard  to  substantive  criminal  law,  procedural  law,  digital 
evidence,  international  cooperation  and  the  responsibility  of  Internet  service  providers  (Chapter  6), 
including examples of international approaches as well as good-practice examples from national solutions. 
This publication addresses the first of the seven strategic goals of the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda 
(GCA), which calls for the elaboration of strategies for the development of cybercrime legislation that is 
globally applicable and interoperable with existing national and regional legislative measures, as well as 
addressing the approach to organizing national cybersecurity efforts under ITU-D Study Group 1 Question 
22/1. Establishing the appropriate legal infrastructure is an integral component of a national cybersecurity 
strategy. The related mandate of ITU with regard to capacity building was emphasized by Resolution 130 
(Rev.  Guadalajara,  2010)  of  the  ITU  Plenipotentiary  Conference,  on  Strengthening  the  role  of  ITU  in 
building confidence and security in the use of information and communication technologies. The adoption 
by  all  countries  of  appropriate  legislation  against  the  misuse  of  ICTs  for  criminal  or  other  purposes, 
including  activities  intended  to  affect  the  integrity  of  national  critical  information  infrastructures,  is 
central  to  achieving  global  cybersecurity.  Since  threats  can  originate  anywhere  around  the  globe,  the 
challenges  are  inherently  international  in  scope  and  require  international  cooperation,  investigative 
assistance,  and  common  substantive  and  procedural  provisions.  Thus,  it  is  important  that  countries 
harmonize their legal frameworks to combat cybercrime and facilitate international cooperation.

Infrastructure and services 

1.1 
The  Internet  is  one  of  the  fastest-growing  areas  of  technical  infrastructure  development.1 Today, 
information and communication technologies (ICTs) are omnipresent and the trend towards digitization is 
growing.  The  demand  for  Internet  and  computer  connectivity  has  led  to  the  integration  of  computer 
technology into products that have usually functioned without it, such as cars and buildings.2 Electricity 
supply, transportation infrastructure, military services and logistics – virtually all modern services depend 
on the use of ICTs.3  
Although  the  development  of  new  technologies  is  focused  mainly  on  meeting  consumer  demands  in 
western countries, developing countries can also benefit from new technologies.4 With the availability of 
long-distance wireless communication technologies such as WiMAX5 and computer systems that are now 
available for less than USD 2006, many more people in developing countries should have easier access to 
the Internet and related products and services.7 
The  influence  of  ICTs  on  society  goes  far  beyond  establishing  basic  information  infrastructure.  The 
availability of ICTs is a foundation for development in the creation, availability and use of network-based 
services.8 E-mails  have  displaced  traditional  letters9;  online  web  representation  is  nowadays  more 
important  for  businesses  than  printed  publicity  materials;10 and  Internet-based  communication  and 
phone services are growing faster than landline communications.11  
The  availability  of  ICTs  and  new  network-based  services  offer  a  number  of  advantages  for  society  in 
general, especially for developing countries.  
ICT applications, such as e-government, e-commerce, e-education, e-health and e-environment, are seen 
as enablers for development, as they provide an efficient channel to deliver a wide range of basic services 
in  remote  and  rural  areas.  ICT  applications  can  facilitate  the  achievement  of  millennium  development 
targets,  reducing  poverty  and  improving  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  developing  countries. 
Given  the  right  approach,  context  and  implementation  processes,  investments  in  ICT  applications  and 
tools can result in productivity and quality improvements. In turn, ICT applications may release technical 
and human capacity and enable greater access to basic services. In this regard, online identity theft and 
the act of capturing another person’s credentials and/or personal information via the Internet with the 
intent to fraudulently reuse it for criminal purposes is now one of the main threats to further deployment 
of e-government and e-business services.12 
The costs of Internet services are often also much lower than comparable services outside the network.13 
E-mail  services  are  often  available  free  of  charge  or  cost  very  little  compared  to  traditional  postal 
services.14 The  online  encyclopaedia  Wikipedia15 can  be  used  free  of  charge,  as  can  hundreds  of  online 
hosting  services.16 Lower  costs  are  important,  as  they  enable  services  to  be  used  by  many  more  users, 
including  people  with  only  limited  income.  Given  the  limited  financial  resources  of  many  people  in 
developing countries, the Internet enables them to use services they may not otherwise have access to 
outside the network.

Advantages and risks 

 
1.2 
The introduction of ICTs into many aspects of everyday life has led to the development of the modern 
concept  of  the  information  society. 17  This  development  of  the  information  society  offers  great 
opportunities.18 Unhindered access to information can support democracy, as the flow of information is 
taken out of the control of state authorities (as has happened, for example, in Eastern Europe and North 
Africa).19 Technical developments have improved daily life – for example, online banking and shopping, 
the use of mobile data services and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) telephony are just some examples 
of how far the integration of ICTs into our daily lives has advanced.20  
However, the growth of the information society is accompanied by new and serious threats.21 Essential 
services  such  as  water  and  electricity  supply  now  rely  on  ICTs.22 Cars,  traffic  control,  elevators,  air 
conditioning and telephones also depend on the smooth functioning of ICTs.23 Attacks against information 
infrastructure and Internet services now have the potential to harm society in new and critical ways.24  
Attacks against information infrastructure and Internet services have already taken place.25 Online fraud 
and hacking attacks are just some examples of computer-related crimes that are committed on a large 
scale  every  day.26 The  financial  damage  caused  by  cybercrime  is  reported  to  be  enormous.27 In  2003 
alone, malicious software caused damages of up to USD 17 billion.28 By some estimates, revenues from 
cybercrime exceeded USD 100 billion in 2007, outstripping the illegal trade in drugs for the first time.29 
Nearly 60 per cent of businesses in the United States believe that cybercrime is more costly to them than 
physical  crime. 30  These  estimates  clearly  demonstrate  the  importance  of  protecting  information 
infrastructures.31 
Most  of  the  above-mentioned  attacks  against  computer  infrastructure  are  not  necessarily  targeting 
critical infrastructure. However, the malicious software “Stuxnet” that was discovered in 2010 underlines 
the threat of attacks focusing on critical infrastructure.32 The software, with more than 4 000 functions33, 
focused on computer systems running software that is typically used to control critical infrastructure.34 

Cybersecurity and cybercrime 

1.3 
Cybercrime and cybersecurity are issues that can hardly be separated in an interconnected environment. 
The fact that the 2010 UN General Assembly resolution on cybersecurity35 addresses cybercrime as one 
major challenge underlines this.  
Cybersecurity36 plays an important role in the ongoing development of information technology, as well as 
Internet  services. 37 Enhancing  cybersecurity  and  protecting  critical  information  infrastructures  are 
essential  to  each  nation’s  security  and  economic  well-being.  Making  the  Internet  safer  (and  protecting 
Internet users) has become integral to the development of new services as well as government policy.38 
Deterring  cybercrime  is  an  integral  component  of  a  national  cybersecurity  and  critical  information 
infrastructure  protection  strategy.  In  particular,  this  includes  the  adoption  of  appropriate  legislation 
against the misuse of ICTs for criminal or other purposes and activities intended to affect the integrity of 
national critical infrastructures. At the national level, this is a shared responsibility requiring coordinated 
action  related  to  prevention,  preparation,  response  and  recovery  from  incidents  on  the  part  of 
government authorities, the private sector and citizens. At the regional and international level, this entails 
cooperation and coordination with relevant partners. The formulation and implementation of a national 
framework  and  strategy  for  cybersecurity  thus  requires  a  comprehensive  approach.39 Cybersecurity 
strategies – for example, the development of technical protection systems or the education of users to 
prevent  them  from  becoming  victims  of  cybercrime  –  can  help  to  reduce  the  risk  of  cybercrime.40 The 
development and support of cybersecurity strategies are a vital element in the fight against cybercrime.41  
The  legal,  technical  and  institutional  challenges  posed  by  the  issue  of  cybersecurity  are  global  and  far-
reaching, and can only be addressed through a coherent strategy taking into account the role of different 
stakeholders and existing initiatives, within a framework of international cooperation.42 In this regard, the 
World  Summit  on  the  Information  Society  (WSIS)43 recognized  the  real  and  significant  risks  posed  by 
inadequate cybersecurity and the proliferation of cybercrime. The provisions of §§ 108-110 of the WSIS 
Tunis  Agenda  for  the  Information  Society44,  including  the  Annex,  set  out  a  plan  for  multistakeholder

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
implementation  at  the  international  level  of  the  WSIS  Geneva  Plan  of  Action, 45  describing  the 
multistakeholder implementation process according to eleven action lines and allocating responsibilities 
for  facilitating  implementation  of  the  different  action  lines.  At  WSIS,  world  leaders  and  governments 
designated ITU to facilitate the implementation of WSIS Action Line C5, dedicated to building confidence 
and security in the use of ICTs.46 
In  this  regard,  the  ITU  Secretary-General  launched the  Global  Cybersecurity  Agenda  (GCA)47 on  17  May 
2007, alongside partners from governments, industry, regional and international organizations, academic 
and research institutions. The GCA is a global framework for dialogue and international cooperation to 
coordinate  the  international  response  to  the  growing  challenges  to  cybersecurity  and  to  enhance 
confidence and security in the information society. It builds on existing work, initiatives and partnerships 
with  the  objective  of  proposing  global  strategies  to  address  today’s  challenges  related  to  building 
confidence  and  security  in  the  use  of  ICTs.  Within  ITU,  the  GCA  complements  existing  ITU  work 
programmes by facilitating the implementation of the three ITU Sectors’ cybersecurity activities, within a 
framework of international cooperation. 
The  Global  Cybersecurity  Agenda  has  seven  main  strategic  goals,  built  on  five  work  areas:  1) Legal 
measures; 2) Technical and procedural measures; 3) Organizational structures; 4) Capacity building; and 
5) International cooperation.48 
The  fight  against  cybercrime  needs  a  comprehensive  approach.  Given  that  technical  measures  alone 
cannot  prevent  any  crime,  it  is  critical  that  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  investigate  and 
prosecute  cybercrime  effectively.49 Among  the  GCA  work  areas,  “Legal  measures”  focuses  on  how  to 
address  the  legislative  challenges  posed  by  criminal  activities  committed  over  ICT  networks  in  an 
internationally  compatible  manner.  “Technical  and  procedural  measures”  focuses  on  key  measures  to 
promote  adoption  of  enhanced  approaches  to  improve  security  and  risk  management  in  cyberspace, 
including  accreditation  schemes,  protocols  and  standards.  “Organizational  structures”  focuses  on  the 
prevention,  detection,  response  to  and  crisis  management  of  cyberattacks,  including  the  protection  of 
critical  information  infrastructure  systems.  “Capacity  building”  focuses  on  elaborating  strategies  for 
capacity-building  mechanisms  to  raise  awareness,  transfer  know-how  and  boost  cybersecurity  on  the 
national policy agenda. Finally, “International cooperation” focuses on international cooperation, dialogue 
and coordination in dealing with cyberthreats. 
The  development  of  adequate  legislation  and  within  this  approach  the  development  of  a  cybercrime-
related  legal  framework  is  an  essential  part  of  a  cybersecurity  strategy.  This  requires  first  of  all  the 
necessary substantive criminal law provisions to criminalize acts such as computer fraud, illegal access, 
data  interference,  copyright  violations  and  child  pornography.50 The  fact  that  provisions  exist  in  the 
criminal code that are applicable to similar acts committed outside the network does not mean that they 
can be applied to acts committed over the Internet as well.51 Therefore, a thorough analysis of current 
national laws is vital to identify any possible gaps.52 Apart from substantive criminal law provisions53, the 
law-enforcement  agencies  need  the  necessary  tools  and  instruments  to  investigate  cybercrime.54 Such 
investigations themselves present a number of challenges.55 Perpetrators can act from nearly any location 
in the world and take measures to mask their identity.56 The tools and instruments needed to investigate 
cybercrime can be quite different from those used to investigate ordinary crimes.57 

International dimensions of cybercrime 

1.4 
Cybercrime  often  has  an  international  dimension.58 E-mails  with  illegal  content  often  pass  through  a 
number of countries during the transfer from sender to recipient, or illegal content is stored outside the 
country.59 Within  cybercrime  investigations,  close  cooperation  between  the  countries  involved  is  very 
important.60 The  existing  mutual  legal  assistance  agreements  are  based  on  formal,  complex  and  often 
time-consuming procedures, and in addition often do not cover computer-specific investigations.61 Setting 
up  procedures  for  quick  response  to  incidents,  as  well  as  requests  for  international  cooperation,  is 
therefore vital.62  

 

3 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
A number of countries base their mutual legal assistance regime on the principle of “dual criminality”.63 
Investigations  on  a  global  level  are  generally  limited  to  those  crimes  that  are  criminalized  in  all 
participating  countries.  Although  there  are  a  number  of  offences  –  such  as  the  distribution  of  child 
pornography – that can be prosecuted in most jurisdictions, regional differences play an important role.64 
One example is other types of illegal content, such as hate speech. The criminalization of illegal content 
differs in various countries.65 Material that can lawfully be distributed in one country can easily be illegal 
in another country.66 
The computer technology currently in use is basically the same around the world.67 Apart from language 
issues and power adapters, there is very little difference between the computer systems and cell phones 
sold  in  Asia  and  those  sold  in  Europe.  An  analogous  situation  arises  in  relation  to  the  Internet.  Due  to 
standardization, the network protocols used in countries on the African continent are the same as those 
used in the United States.68 Standardization enables users around the world to access the same services 
over the Internet.69  
The question is what effect the harmonization of global technical standards has on the development of 
the national criminal law. In terms of illegal content, Internet users can access information from around 
the world, enabling them to access information available legally abroad that could be illegal in their own 
country.  
Theoretically,  developments  arising  from  technical  standardization  go  far  beyond  the  globalization  of 
technology and services and could lead to the harmonization of national laws. However, as shown by the 
negotiations over the First Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (the “Convention 
on Cybercrime”),70 the principles of national law change much more slowly than technical developments.71  
Although the Internet may not recognize border controls, there are means to restrict access to certain 
information.72 The  access  provider  can  generally  block  certain  websites  and  the  service  provider  that 
stores a website can prevent access to information for those users on the basis of IP-addresses linked to a 
certain country (“IP-targeting”).73 Both measures can be circumvented, but are nevertheless instruments 
that can be used to retain territorial differences in a global network.74 The OpenNet Initiative75 reports 
that this kind of censorship is practised by about two dozen countries.76 

Consequences for developing countries 

1.5 
Finding response strategies and solutions to the threat of cybercrime is a major challenge, especially for 
developing countries. A comprehensive anti-cybercrime strategy generally contains technical protection 
measures,  as  well  as  legal  instruments.77 The  development  and  implementation  of  these  instruments 
need  time.  Technical  protection  measures  are  especially  cost-intensive.78 Developing  countries  need  to 
integrate protection measures into the roll-out of the Internet from the beginning, as although this might 
initially raise the cost of Internet services, the long-term gains in avoiding the costs and damage inflicted 
by  cybercrime  are  large  and  far  outweigh  any  initial  outlays  on  technical  protection  measures  and 
network safeguards.79  
The  risks  associated  with  weak  protection  measures  could  in  fact  affect  developing  countries  more 
intensely, due to their less strict safeguards and protection.80 The ability to protect customers, as well as 
firms, is a fundamental requirement not only for regular businesses, but also for online or Internet-based 
businesses.  In  the  absence  of  Internet  security,  developing  countries  could  encounter  significant 
difficulties promoting e-business and participating in online service industries.  
The  development  of  technical  measures  to  promote  cybersecurity  and  proper  cybercrime  legislation  is 
vital  for  both  developed  countries  and  developing  countries.  Compared  with  the  costs  of  grafting 
safeguards  and  protection  measures  onto  computer  networks  at  a  later  date,  it  is  likely  that  initial 
measures taken right from the outset will be less expensive. Developing countries need to bring their anti-
cybercrime strategies into line with international standards from the outset.81

1   On the development of the Internet, see: Yang, Miao, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series; Vol. 113; 

Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Electronic Commerce, page 52 – 56; The World Information Society 
Report 2007, available at: www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/worldinformationsociety/2007/. According to ITU, there 
were over 2 billion Internet users by the end of 2010, of which 1.2 billion in developing countries. For more information, 
see: ITU ICT Facts and Figures 2010, page 3, available at: www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/material/FactsFigures2010.pdf.

Objects – Social, Economic & Ethical Implications”, Journal of Human and Ecological Risk Assessment, Vol. 10, page 763 
et seq., available at: www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/papers/hera.pdf. A demonstration of the impact of even short 
interruptions to Internet and computer services was the harm caused by the computer worm “Sasser”. In 2004, the 
worm affected computers running versions of Microsoft’s Windows operating system. As a result of the worm, a 
number of services were interrupted. Among them were the US airline “Delta Airlines” that had to cancel several trans-
Atlantic flights because its computer systems had been swamped by the worm, whilst the electronic mapping services 
of the British Coastguard were disabled for a few hours. See Heise News, 04.01.2005, available at:

36   The term “Cybersecurity” is used to summarize various activities and ITU-T Recommendation X.1205 “Overview of 

cybersecurity” provides a definition, description of technologies, and network protection principles: “Cybersecurity is 
the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, 
actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyberenvironment and 
organization and user’s assets. Organization and user’s assets include connected computing devices, personnel, 
infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunication systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored 
information in the cyberenvironment. Cybersecurity strives to ensure the attainment and maintenance of the security 
properties of the organization and user’s assets against relevant security risks in the cyberenvironment. The general 
security objectives comprise the following: Availability; Integrity, which may include authenticity and non-repudiation; 
Confidentiality.” Also see: ITU, List of Security-Related Terms and Definitions, available at: www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-

63   Dual criminality exists if the offence is a crime under both the requested and requesting party’s laws. The difficulties the 

dual criminality principle can cause within international investigations are a current issue in a number of international 
conventions and treaties. Examples include Art. 2 of the EU Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European 
arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JHA). Regarding the dual criminality 
principle in international investigations, see: United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-

nature committed through computer systems (CETS No. 189), available at: www.conventions.coe.int. 

71   Since parties participating in the negotiation could not agree on a common position on the criminalization of the 
dissemination of xenophobic material, provisions related to this topic were integrated into a First Protocol to the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.

Most reports, guides or publications on cybercrime begin by defining the terms82 “computer crime” and 
“cybercrime”.83 In  this  context,  various  approaches  have  been  adopted  in  recent  decades  to  develop  a 
precise  definition  for  both  terms.84 Before  providing  an  overview  of  the  debate  and  evaluating  the 
approaches,  it  is  useful  to  determine  the  relationship  between  “cybercrime”  and  “computer-related 
crimes”.85 Without  going  into  detail  at  this  stage,  the  term  “cybercrime”  is  narrower  than  computer-
related  crimes  as  it  has  to  involve  a  computer  network.  Computer-related  crimes  cover  even  those 
offences that bear no relation to a network, but only affect stand-alone computer systems.  
During the 10th United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, two 
definitions were developed within a related workshop:86 Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime) 
covers  any  illegal  behaviour  directed  by  means  of  electronic  operations  that  target  the  security  of 
computer  systems  and  the  data  processed  by  them.  Cybercrime  in  a  broader  sense  (computer-related 
crimes)  covers  any  illegal  behaviour  committed  by  means  of,  or  in  relation  to,  a  computer  system  or 
network, including such crimes as illegal possession and offering or distributing information by means of a 
computer system or network.87  
One common definition describes cybercrime as any activity in which computers or networks are a tool, a 
target or a place of criminal activity.88 There are several difficulties with this broad definition. It would, for 
example, cover traditional crimes such as murder, if perchance the offender used a keyboard to hit and 
kill  the  victim.  Another  broader  definition  is  provided  in  Article 1.1  of  the  Stanford  Draft  International 
Convention to Enhance Protection from Cyber Crime and Terrorism (the “Stanford Draft”),89 which points 
out that cybercrime refers to acts in respect to cybersystems.90  
Some definitions try to take objectives or intentions into account and define cybercrime more precisely91, 
such as “computer-mediated activities which are either illegal or considered illicit by certain parties and 
which can be conducted through global electronic networks”.92 These more refined descriptions exclude 
cases where physical hardware is used to commit regular crimes, but they risk excluding crimes that are 
considered  as  cybercrime  in  international  agreements  such  as  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law  on 
Computer  and  Computer-related  Crime  or  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.93 For 
example,  a  person  who  produces  USB94 devices  containing  malicious  software  that  destroys  data  on 
computers when the device is connected commits a crime as defined by Article 4 of the Convention on 
Cybercrime.95 However, since the act of deleting data using a physical device to copy malicious code has 

 

11 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
not  been  committed  through  global  electronic  networks,  it  would  not  qualify  as  cybercrime  under  the 
narrow  definition  above.  Such  acts  would  only  qualify  as  cybercrime  under  a  definition  based  on  a 
broader description, including acts such as illegal data interference. 
The  variety  of  approaches,  as  well  as  the  related  problems,  demonstrates  that  there  are  considerable 
difficulties in defining the terms “computer crime” and “cybercrime”.96 The term “cybercrime” is used to 
describe a range of offences including traditional computer crimes, as well as network crimes. As these 
crimes  differ  in  many  ways,  there  is  no  single  criterion  that  could  include  all  acts  mentioned  in  the 
different  regional  and  international  legal  approaches  to  address  the  issue,  whilst  excluding  traditional 
crimes  that  are  just  facilitated  by  using  hardware.  The  fact  that  there  is  no  single  definition  of 
“cybercrime” need not be important, as long as the term is not used as a legal term.97 Instead of referring 
to a definition, the following chapters will be based on a typology-related approach.

Organised Crime in Europe: The Threat of Cybercrime, Situation Report 2004. 
The term “cybercrime” is used to cover a wide variety of criminal conduct.98 As recognized crimes include 
a  broad  range  of  different  offences,  it  is  difficult  to  develop  a  typology  or  classification  system  for 
cybercrime.99 One  approach  can  be  found  in  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,100 which  distinguishes 
between four different types of offences101:  

Virology,

1.  offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems;102 
2.  computer-related offences;103 
3.  content-related offences;104 and 
4.  copyright-related offences.105  

This  typology  is  not  wholly  consistent,  as  it  is  not  based  on  a  sole  criterion  to  differentiate  between 
categories. Three categories focus on the object of legal protection: “offences against the confidentiality, 
integrity  and  availability  of  computer  data  and  systems”106;  content-related  offences107;  and  copyright-
related offences108. The fourth category of “computer-related offences”109 does not focus on the object of 
legal protection, but on the method used to commit the crime. This inconsistency leads to some overlap 
between categories.  
In  addition,  some  terms  that  are  used  to  describe  criminal  acts  (such  as  “cyberterrorism” 110 or 
“phishing”111) cover acts that fall within several categories. Nonetheless, the four categories can serve as 
a useful basis for discussing the phenomena of cybercrime. 

Development of computer crime and cybercrime 

2.3 
The criminal abuse of information technology and the necessary legal response are issues that have been 
discussed ever since the technology was introduced. Over the last 50 years, various solutions have been 
implemented at the national and regional levels. One of the reasons why the topic remains challenging is 
the constant technical development, as well as the changing methods and ways in which the offences are 
committed. 

The 1960s 

2.3.1 
In  the  1960s,  the  introduction  of  transistor-based  computer  systems,  which  were  smaller  and  less 
expensive than vacuum-tube based machines, led to an increase in the use of computer technology.112 At 
this  early  stage,  offences  focused  on  physical  damage  to  computer  systems  and  stored  data.113 Such 

12 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
incidents  were  reported,  for  example,  in  Canada,  where  in  1969  a  student  riot  caused  a  fire  that 
destroyed computer data hosted at the university.114 In the mid 1960s, the United States started a debate 
on  the  creation  of  a  central  data-storage  authority  for  all  ministries.115 Within  this  context,  possible 
criminal abuse of databases116 and the related risks to privacy117 were discussed.118  

The 1970s 

2.3.2 
In  the  1970s,  the  use  of  computer  systems  and  computer  data  increased  further.119 At  the  end  of  the 
decade, an estimated number of 100 000 mainframe computers were operating in the United States.120 
With falling prices, computer technology was more widely used within administration and business, and 
by  the  public.  The  1970s  were  characterized  by  a  shift  from  the  traditional  property  crimes  against 
computer  systems121 that  had  dominated  the  1960s,  to  new  forms  of  crime.122 While  physical  damage 
continued to be a relevant form of criminal abuse against computer systems,123 new forms of computer 
crime were recognized. They included the illegal use  of computer systems124 and the manipulation125 of 
electronic data.126 The shift from manual to computer-operated transactions led to another new form of 
crime  –  computer-related  fraud.127 Already  at  this  time,  multimillion  dollar  losses  were  caused  by 
computer-related  fraud. 128  Computer-related  fraud,  in  particular,  was  a  real  challenge,  and  law-
enforcement agencies were investigating more and more cases.129 As the application of existing legislation 
in computer-crime cases led to difficulties,130 a debate about legal solutions started in different parts of 
the  world.131 The  United  States  discussed  a  draft  bill  designed  specifically  to  address  cybercrime.132 
Interpol discussed the phenomena and possibilities for legal response.133  

The 1980s  

2.3.3 
In the 1980s, personal computers became more and more popular. With this development, the number of 
computer systems and hence the number of potential targets for criminals again increased. For the first 
time, the targets included a broad range of critical infrastructure.134 One of the side effects of the spread 
of computer systems was an increasing interest in software, resulting in the emergence of the first forms 
of  software  piracy  and  crimes  related  to  patents.135 The  interconnection  of  computer  systems  brought 
about  new  types  of  offence.136 Networks  enabled  offenders  to  enter  a  computer  system  without  being 
present  at  the  crime  scene.137 In  addition,  the  possibility  of  distributing  software  through  networks 
enabled  offenders  to  spread  malicious  software,  and  more  and  more  computer  viruses  were 
discovered.138 Countries started the process of updating their legislation so as to meet the requirements 
of  a  changing  criminal  environment.139 International  organizations  also  got  involved  in  the  process. 
OECD140 and  the  Council  of  Europe141 set  up  study  groups  to  analyse  the  phenomena  and  evaluate 
possibilities for legal response. 

The 1990s  

2.3.4 
The introduction of the graphical interface (“WWW”) in the 1990s that was followed by a rapid growth in 
the number of Internet users led to new challenges. Information legally made available in one country 
was available globally – even in countries where the publication of such information was criminalized.142 
Another  concern  associated  with  online  services  that  turned  out  to  be  especially  challenging  in  the 
investigation of transnational crime was the speed of information exchange.143 Finally, the distribution of 
child  pornography  moved  from  physical  exchange  of  books  and  tapes  to  online  distribution  through 
websites and Internet services.144 While computer crimes were in general local crimes, the Internet turned 
electronic  crimes  into  transnational  crime.  As  a  result,  the  international  community  tackled  the  issue 
more  intensively.  UN  General  Assembly  Resolution  45/121  adopted  in  1990145 and  the  manual  for  the 
prevention and control of computer-related crimes issued in 1994 are just two examples.146 

The 21st Century 

2.3.5 
As in each preceding decade, new trends in computer crime and cybercrime continued to be discovered in 
the  21st  century.  The  first  decade  of  the  new  millennium  was  dominated  by  new,  highly  sophisticated 
methods  of  committing  crimes,  such  as  “phishing”,147 and  “botnet  attacks”,148 and  the  emerging  use  of 
technology that is more difficult for law  enforcement to handle and investigate, such as “voice-over-IP 

 

13 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
(VoIP) communication”149 and “cloud computing”.150 It is not only the methods that changed, but also the 
impact. As offenders became able to automate attacks, the number of offences increased. Countries and 
regional and international organizations have responded to the growing challenges and given response to 
cybercrime high priority.

Crime statistics can be used by academia and policy-makers as a basis for discussion and for the ensuing 
decision-making process.151 Furthermore, access to precise information on the true extent of cybercrime 
would  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to  improve  anti-cybercrime  strategies,  deter  potential  attacks 
and  enact  more  appropriate  and  effective  legislation.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  the  impact  of 
cybercrime on society on the basis of the number of offences carried out in a given time-frame.152 Such 
data  can  in  general  be  taken  from  crime  statistics  and  surveys,153 but  both  these  sources  come  with 
challenges when it comes to using them for formulating policy recommendations.

Crime statistics 

2.4.1 
The  following  numbers  have  been  extracted  from  national  crime  statistics.  As  further  discussed  below, 
they are not intended to be representative of either the global development of cybercrime or of the true 
extent of cybercrime at the national level, and are thus presented only to provide an insight into country 
information.  

•  The  US  Internet  Complaint  Center  reports  a  22.3  per  cent  increase  in  complaints  submitted 

relating to cybercrime compared with 2008.154 

•  German Crime Statistics indicate that the overall number of Internet-related crimes increased in 

2009 by 23.6 per cent compared with 2008.155 

It is unclear how representative the statistics are and whether they provide reliable information on the 
extent  of  crime.156 There  are  several  difficulties  associated  with  determining  the  global  threat  of 
cybercrime on the basis of crime statistics.157 
First of all, crime statistics are generally created at the national level and do not reflect the international 
scope of the issue. Even though it would theoretically be possible to combine the available data, such an 
approach  would  not  yield  reliable  information  because  of  variations  in  legislation  and  recording 
practices. 158  Combining  and  comparing  national  crime  statistics  requires  a  certain  degree  of 
compatibility159 that is missing when it comes to cybercrime. Even if cybercrime data are recorded, they 
are not necessarily listed as a separate figure.160 Furthermore, statistics only list crimes that are detected 
and reported.161 Especially with regard to cybercrime, there are concerns that the number of unreported 
cases  is  significant.162 Businesses  may  fear  that  negative  publicity  could  damage  their  reputation.163 If  a 
company announces that hackers have accessed their server, customers may lose faith. The full costs and 
consequences  could  be  greater  than  the  losses  caused  by  the  hacking  attack.  On  the  other  hand,  if 
offenders are not reported and prosecuted, they may go on to re-offend. Victims may not believe that 

14 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
law-enforcement  agencies  will  be  able  to  identify  offenders. 164 Comparing  the  large  number  of 
cybercrimes with the few successful investigations, they may see little point in reporting offences.165 As 
automation  of  attacks  enables  cybercriminals  to  pursue  a  strategy  of  reaping  large  profits  from  many 
attacks  targeting  small  amounts  (e.g. as  is  the  case  with  advance  fee  fraud166),  the  possible  impact  of 
unreported  crimes  could  be  significant.  For  only  small  amounts,  victims  may  prefer  not  to  go  through 
time-consuming  reporting  procedures.  Reported  cases  are  often  the  ones  that  involve  very  large 
amounts.167  
In summary, statistical information is useful to draw attention to the continuing and growing importance 
of the issue, and it is necessary to point out that one of the major challenges related to cybercrime is the 
lack  of  reliable  information  on  the  extent  of  the  problem,  as  well  as  on  arrests,  prosecutions  and 
convictions. As already stated, crime statistics often do not list offences separately, and available statistics 
on  the  impact  of  cybercrime  are  in  general  unable  to  provide  reliable  information  about  the  scale  or 
extent of offences at a level sufficient for policy-makers.168 Without such data, it is difficult to quantify the 
impact  of  cybercrime  on  society  and  to  develop  strategies  to  address  the  issue.169 Nevertheless,  the 
statistics  can  serve  as  a  basis  for  determining  trends,  which  can  be  found  by  comparing  results  over 
several years, and serve as guidance with regard to the process of reporting cybercrime.170  

Surveys 

2.4.2 
The following numbers have been extracted from different surveys. As further discussed below, they are 
not  necessarily  representative,  and  are  thus  presented  only  to  give  an  insight  into  the  results  of  such 
surveys. 

• 

•  Credit card and bank account information are among the most popular information advertised on 
underground  economy  services.  The  prices  range  between  USD 0.85-USD 30  (single  credit  card 
information) and USD 15-USD 850 (single bank account information).171 
In 2007, auction fraud was among the top Internet scams in the US, with an average loss of more 
than USD 1 000 per case.172 
In 2005, losses as a result of identity-related offences in the US totalled USD 56.6 billion.173 

• 
•  The  financial  and  personal  cost  of  cybercrime  varies  significantly  among  single  incidents  in 

Ireland, generating aggregate costs of over EUR 250 000.174 

•  A single computer security company created more than 450 000 new malicious code signatures in 

a single quarter.175 

•  A quarter of all companies responding to a questionnaire in 2010 reported operational losses as a 

result of cybercrime.176 

•  Decreasing  number  of  denial-of-service  and  computer-virus  attacks  reported  by  security 

professionals between 2004 and 2008.177 
In 2009, the United States, China, Brazil, Germany and India were among the countries reporting 
most malicious activities.178 

• 

There are several concerns related to the use of such surveys in determining the extent and impact of 
cybercrime. 
It  is  very  difficult  to  provide  reliable  estimations  of  financial  losses.  Some  sources  estimate  losses  to 
businesses and institutions in the United States179 due to cybercrime to be as high as USD 67 billion in a 
single year; however, it is uncertain whether the extrapolation of sample survey results is justifiable.180 
This methodological criticism applies not only to losses, but also to the number of recognized offences.  
Another  difficulty  related  to  statistical  information  is  the  fact  that  very  often  either  unreliable  or  non-
verifiable information is repeatedly quoted. One example of this relates to statistical information on the 
Internet  child  pornography.  Several  analyses  quote,  for  example,  that 
commercial  aspects  of 
TopTenReviews  estimated  that 
Internet  child  pornography  generates  USD 2.5  billion  annually 

 

15 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
worldwide.181 Yet TopTenReviews does not provide any background information on how the research was 
undertaken. Bearing in mind that TopTenReview claims on its website that the company “gives you the 
information you need to make a smart purchase. We make a recommendation for the best product in each 
category. Through our side-by-side comparison charts, news, articles, and videos we simplify the buying 
process for consumers”, there may be serious concerns as to the use of such data. Another example of 
figures quoted without verifiable reference was discovered by the Wall Street Journal in 2006.182 While 
investigating a quotation that child pornography is a multi-billion dollar business (USD 20 billion a year), 
the  journalist  reported  that  two  main  documents  containing  information  about  revenues  from 
USD 3 billion to 20 billion – a publication from NCMEC and one from the Council of Europe – referred to 
institutions that did not confirm the numbers.  
As  surveys  often  only  count  incidents  without  providing  further  information  or  details,  it  is  difficult  to 
draw  conclusions  with  regard  to  trends.  One  example  is  the  United  States  CSI183 Computer  Crime  and 
Security  Survey  2007 that analyses  the number  of computer-related  offences  committed,  among  other 
trends.184 It  is  based  on  the  responses  of  494  computer  security  practitioners  from  US  corporations, 
government  agencies  and  financial  institutions  in  the  US.185 The  survey  documents  the  number  of 
offences reported by respondents between 2000 and 2007. It shows that, since 2001, the proportion of 
respondents who experienced and acknowledged virus attacks or unauthorized access to information (or 
system penetration) decreased. The survey does not explain why this decrease has occurred.  
The  surveys  on  cybercrime  are  unable  to  provide  reliable  information  about  the  scale  or  extent  of 
offences.186 The uncertainty about the extent to which offences are reported by targets187, as well as the 
fact that no explanation for the reducing numbers of cybercrimes can be found, render these statistics 
open  to  interpretation.  At  present,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  for  predictions  on  future  trends  and 
developments.

All  offences  in  this  category  are  directed  against  (at  least)  one  of  the  three  legal  principles  of 
confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability.  Unlike  crimes  that  have  been  covered  by  criminal  law  for 
centuries  (such  as  theft  or  murder),  the  computerization  of  offences  is  relatively  recent,  as  computer 
systems  and  computer  data  were  only  developed  around  60  years  ago.188 The  effective  prosecution  of 
these  acts  requires  that  existing  criminal  law  provisions  not  only  protect  tangible  items  and  physical 
documents from manipulation, but also extend to include these new legal principles.189 This section gives 
an overview of the most commonly occurring offences included in this category.

Illegal access (hacking, cracking)190 

 
2.5.1 
The  offence  described  as  “hacking”  refers  to  unlawful  access  to  a  computer  system191,  one  of  oldest 
computer-related  crimes.192 Following  the  development  of  computer  networks  (especially  the  Internet), 
this crime has become a mass phenomenon.193 Famous targets of hacking attacks include the US National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Air Force, the Pentagon, Yahoo, Google, eBay and 
the German Government.194  
Examples  of  hacking  offences  include  breaking  the  password  of  password-protected  websites195 and 
circumventing  password  protection  on  a  computer  system.  But  acts  related  to  the  term  “hacking”  also 
include preparatory acts such as the use of faulty hardware or software implementation to illegally obtain 
a password to enter a computer system196, setting up “spoofing” websites to make users disclose their 
passwords197 and  installing  hardware  and  software-based  keylogging  methods  (e.g. “keyloggers”)  that 
record every keystroke – and consequently any passwords used on the computer and/or device.198 
The  motivation  of  offenders  varies.  Some  offenders  limit  their  activities  to  circumventing  security 
measures  only  in  order  to  prove  their  abilities.199 Others  act  through  political  motivation  (known  as 
“hacktivism”200) – one example is a recent incident involving the main United Nations website.201 In most 
cases,  though,  the  motivation  of  the  offender  is  not  limited  to  illicit  access  to  a  computer  system. 
Offenders use this access to commit further crimes, such as data espionage, data manipulation or denial-
of-service (DoS) attacks.202 In most cases, illegal access to the computer system is only a vital first step.203  
Many  analysts  recognize  a  rising  number  of  attempts  to  illegally  access  computer  systems,  with  over 
250 million incidents recorded worldwide during the month of August 2007 alone.204 Three main factors 
have  supported  the  increasing  number  of  hacking  attacks:  inadequate  and  incomplete  protection  of 
computer  systems,  development  of  software  tools  that  automate  the  attacks,  and  the  growing  role  of 
private computers as a target of hacking attacks. 

Inadequate and incomplete protection of computer systems 
Hundreds  of  millions  of  computers  are  connected  to  the  Internet,  and  many  computer  systems  are 
without adequate protection in place to prevent illegal access.205 Analysis carried out by the University of 
Maryland  suggests  that  an  unprotected  computer  system  that  is  connected  to  the  Internet  is  likely  to 
experience attack within less than a minute.206 The installation of protective measures can lower the risk, 
but successful attacks against well-protected computer systems prove that technical protection measures 
can never completely stop attacks.207  

Development of software tools that automate the attacks 
Recently,  software  tools  are  being  used  to  automate  attacks.208 With  the  help  of  software  and  pre-
installed attacks, a single offender can attack thousands of computer systems in a single day using one 
computer.209 If  the  offender  has  access  to  more  computers  –  e.g. through  a  botnet210 –  he/she  can 
increase the scale still further. Since most of these software tools use preset methods of attacks, not all 
attacks prove successful. Users that update their operating systems and software applications on a regular 
basis  reduce  their  risk  of  falling  victim  to  these  broad-based  attacks,  as  the  companies  developing 
protection software analyse attack tools and prepare for the standardized hacking attacks.  
High-profile attacks are often based on individually-designed attacks. The success of those attacks is often 
not  the  result  of  highly  sophisticated  methods,  but  the  number  of  attacked  computer  systems.  Tools 
enabling these standardized attacks are widely available over the Internet211 – some for free, but efficient 
tools can easily cost several thousand US dollars.212 One example is a hacking tool that allows the offender 
to  define  a  range  of  IP-addresses  (e.g. from  111.2.0.0  to  111.9.253.253).  The  software  allows  for  the 
scanning for unprotected ports of all computers using one of the defined IP-addresses.213  

The growing role of private computers as a target of hacking attacks 
Access to a computer system is often not the primary motivation of an attack.214 Since business computers 
are generally better protected than private computers, attacks on business computers are more difficult 

 

17 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
to carry out using pre-configured software tools.215 Over the past few years, offenders have focused their 
attacks  increasingly  on  private  computers,  since  many  private  computers  are  inadequately  protected. 
Further, private computers often contain sensitive information (e.g. credit card and bank account details). 
Offenders are also targeting private computers because, after a successful attack, offenders can include 
the computer in their botnet and use the computer for further criminal activities.216 
Illegal  access  to  a  computer  system  may  be  viewed  as  analogous  to  illegal  access  to  a  building  and  is 
recognized  as  a  criminal  offence  in  many  countries. 217  Analysis  of  different  approaches  to  the 
criminalization  of  computer  access  shows  that  enacted  provisions  in  some  cases  confuse  illegal  access 
with  subsequent  offences  or  attempt  to  limit  criminalization  of  illegal  access  to  grave  violations  only. 
Some provisions criminalize the initial access, while other approaches limit the criminal offence only to 
those  cases  where  the  accessed  system  is  protected  by  security  measures218 or  the  perpetrator  has 
harmful intentions219 or data was obtained, modified or damaged. Other legal systems do not criminalize 
mere access, but focus on subsequent offences.220 

Illegal data acquisition (data espionage) 

2.5.2 
Sensitive information is often stored in computer systems. If the computer system is connected to the 
Internet,  offenders  can  try  to  access  this  information  via  the  Internet  from  almost  any  place  in  the 
world.221 The  Internet  is  increasingly  used  to  obtain  trade  secrets.222 The  value  of  sensitive  information 
and the ability to access it remotely makes data espionage highly interesting. In the 1980s, a number of 
German hackers succeeded in entering US government and military computer systems, obtaining secret 
information and selling this information to agents from a different country.223 
Offenders  use  various  techniques  to  access  victims’  computers,224 including  software  to  scan  for 
unprotected  ports 225 or  circumvent  protection  measures,226 as  well  as  “social  engineering”.227 The  last 
approach  especially,  which  refers  to  a  non-technical  kind  of  intrusion  that  relies  heavily  on  human 
interaction  and  often  involves  tricking  other  people  into  breaking  normal  security  procedures,  is 
interesting  as  it  not  based  on  technical  means.228 In  the  context  of  illegal  access  it  describes  the 
manipulation  of  human  beings  with  the  intention  of  gaining  access  to  computer  systems.229 Social 
engineering is usually very successful, because the weakest link in computer security is often the users 
operating  the  computer  system.  One  example  is  “phishing”,  which  has  recently  become  a  key  crime 
committed in cyberspace230 and describes attempts to fraudulently acquire sensitive information (such as 
passwords) by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business (e.g. financial institution) in a seemingly 
official electronic communication.  
Although the human vulnerability of users opens the door to the risk of scams, it also offers solutions. 
Well-educated  computer  users  are  not  easy  victims  for  offenders  using  social  engineering.  As  a 
consequence, user education should be an essential part of any anti-cybercrime strategy.231 In addition, 
technical  measures  can  be  taken  to  prevent  illegal  access.  OECD  highlights  the  importance  of 
cryptography for users, as cryptography can help improve data protection.232 If the person or organization 
storing information uses proper protection measures, cryptographic protection can be more efficient than 
any physical protection.233 The success of offenders in obtaining sensitive information is often due to the 
absence  of  protection  measures.  Since  important  information  is  increasingly  being  stored  in  computer 
systems,  it  is  essential  to  evaluate  whether  the  technical  protection  measures  taken  by  the  users  are 
adequate, or if law-makers need to establish additional protection by criminalizing data espionage.234  
Although offenders usually target business secrets, data stored on private computers are also increasingly 
targeted.235 Private  users  often  store  bank-account  and  credit-card  information  on  their  computer.236 
Offenders  can  use  this  information  for  their  own  purposes  (e.g. bank-account  details  to  make  money 
transfers)  or  sell  it  to  a  third  party.237 Credit-card  records  are  for  example  sold  for  up  to  USD  60.238 
Hackers’  focus  on  private  computers  is  interesting,  as  the  profits  from  business  secrets  are  generally 
higher than the profits to be made from obtaining or selling single credit-card information. However, since 
private computers are generally less well protected, data espionage based on private computers is likely 
to become even more profitable.  

18 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
There  are  two  approaches  to  obtaining  information.  Offenders  can  access  a  computer  system  or  data 
storage  device  and  extract  information;  or  try  to  manipulate  the  user  to  make  them  disclose  the 
information or access codes that enable offenders to access information (“phishing”). 
Offenders often use computer tools installed on victims’ computers or malicious software called spyware 
to transmit data to them.239 Various types of spyware have been discovered over recent years, such as 
keyloggers.240 Keyloggers are software tools that record every keystroke typed on an infected computer’s 
keyboard.241 Some keyloggers send all recorded information to the offender, as soon as the computer is 
connected to the Internet. Others perform an initial sort and analysis of the data recorded (e.g. focusing 
on potential credit-card information242) to transmit only major data discovered. Similar devices are also 
available  as  hardware  devices  that  are  plugged  in  between  the  keyboard  and  the  computer  system  to 
record keystrokes on the keyboard. Hardware-based keyloggers are more difficult to install and detect, as 
they  require  physical  access  to  the  computer  system.243 However,  classical  anti-spyware  and  anti-virus 
software is largely unable to identify them.244 
Apart  from  accessing  computer  systems,  offenders  can  also  obtain  data  by  manipulating  the  user. 
Recently,  offenders  have  developed  effective  scams  to  obtain  secret  information  (e.g. bank-account 
information and credit-card data) by manipulating users using social engineering techniques.245 “Phishing” 
has recently become one of the most important crimes related to cyberspace.246 The term “phishing” is 
used  to  describe  a  type  of  crime  that  is  characterized  by  attempts  to  fraudulently  acquire  sensitive 
information,  such  as  passwords,  by  masquerading  as  a  trustworthy  person  or  business  (e.g. financial 
institution) in an apparently official electronic communication.247  

Illegal interception 

2.5.3 
Offenders  can  intercept  communications  between  users248 (such  as  e-mails)  or  other  forms  of  data 
transfers  (when  users  upload  data  onto  webservers  or  access  web-based  external  storage  media249)  in 
order  to  record  the  information  exchanged.  In  this  context,  offenders  can  in  general  target  any 
communication  infrastructure  (e.g. fixed  lines  or  wireless)  and  any  Internet  service  (e.g. e-mail,  chat  or 
VoIP communications250).  
Most  data-transfer  processes  among  Internet  infrastructure  providers  or  Internet  service  providers  are 
well  protected  and  difficult  to  intercept.251 However,  offenders  search  for  weak  points  in  the  system. 
Wireless  technologies  are  enjoying  greater  popularity  and  have  in  the  past  proved  vulnerable.252 
Nowadays, hotels, restaurants and bars offer customers Internet access through wireless access points. 
However, the signals in the data exchanges between the computer and the access point can be received 
within a radius of up to 100 metres.253 Offenders who wish to intercept a data-exchange process can do 
so  from  any  location  within  this  radius. Even  where wireless  communications  are  encrypted,  offenders 
may be able to decrypt the recorded data.254  
To  gain  access  to  sensitive  information,  some  offenders  set  up  access  points  close  to  locations  where 
there  is  a  high  demand  for  wireless  access255 (e.g. near  bars  and  hotels).  The  station  location  is  often 
named  in  such  a  way  that  users  searching  for  an  Internet  access  point  are  more  likely  to  choose  the 
fraudulent access point. If users rely on the access provider to ensure the security of their communication 
without implementing their own security measures, offenders can easily intercept communications. 

lines  does  not  prevent  offenders  from 

intercepting  communications. 256  Data 
The  use  of  fixed 
transmissions passing along a wire emit electromagnetic energy.257 If offenders use the right equipment, 
they can detect and record these emissions258 and may be able to record data transfers between users’ 
computers and the connected system, and also within the computer system.259 
Most countries have moved to protect the use of telecommunication services by criminalizing the illegal 
interception  of  phone  conversations.  However,  given  the  growing  popularity  of  IP-based  services,  law-
makers may need to evaluate to what extent similar protection is offered to IP-based services.260

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Data interference 

 
2.5.4 
Computer  data  are  vital  for  private  users,  businesses  and  administrations,  all  of  which  depend  on  the 
integrity and availability of data.261 Lack of access to data can result in considerable (financial) damage. 
Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing or altering 
computer  data.262 One  common  example  of  the  deletion  of  data  is  the  computer  virus.263 Ever  since 
computer technology was first developed, computer viruses have threatened users who failed to install 
proper protection.264 Since then, the number of computer viruses has risen significantly.265 Not only has 
the number of virus attacks increased, but also the techniques and functions of viruses (payload266) have 
changed.  
Previously, computer viruses were distributed through storage devices such as floppy disks, whilst today 
most  viruses  are  distributed  via  the  Internet  as  attachments  either  to  e-mails  or  to  files  that  users 
download.267 These efficient new methods of distribution have massively accelerated virus infection and 
vastly  increased  the  number  of  infected  computer  systems.  The  computer  worm  SQL  Slammer268 was 
estimated to have infected 90 per cent of vulnerable computer systems within the first 10 minutes of its 
distribution.269 The financial damage caused by virus attacks in 2000 alone was estimated to amount to 
some USD 17 billion.270 In 2003, it was still more than USD 12 billion.271  
Most  first-generation  computer  viruses  either  deleted  information  or  displayed  messages.  Recently, 
payloads  have  diversified.272 Modern  viruses  are  able  to  install  back-doors  enabling  offenders  to  take 
remote control of the victim’s computer or encrypt files so that victims are denied access to their own 
files, until they pay money to receive the key.273  

System interference 

2.5.5 
The same concerns over attacks against computer data apply to attacks against computer systems. More 
businesses are incorporating Internet services into their production processes, with benefits of 24-hour 
availability  and  worldwide  accessibility.274 If  offenders  succeed  in  preventing  computer  systems  from 
operating smoothly, this can result in great financial losses for victims.275  
Attacks can be carried out by physical attacks on the computer system.276 If offenders are able to access 
the computer system, they can destroy hardware. For most criminal legal systems, remote physical cases 
do not pose major problems, as they are similar to classic cases of damage or destruction of property. 
However, for highly profitable e-commerce businesses, the financial damages caused by attacks on the 
computer system are often far greater than the mere cost of computer hardware.277  
More  challenging  for  legal  systems  are  web-based  scams.  Examples  of  these  remote  attacks  against 
computer systems include computer worms278 and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.279 
Computer  worms280 are  a  subgroup  of  malware  (like  computer  viruses).  They  are  self-replicating 
computer  programs  that  harm  the  network  by  initiating  multiple  data-transfer  processes.  They  can 
influence  computer  systems  by  hindering  the  smooth  running  of  the  computer  system,  using  system 
resources  to  replicate  themselves  over  the  Internet  or  generating  network  traffic  that  can  close  down 
availability of certain services (such as websites).  
While  computer  worms  generally  influence  the  whole  network  without  targeting  specific  computer 
systems,  DoS  attacks  target  specific  computer  systems.  A  DoS  attack  makes  computer  resources 
unavailable  to  their  intended  users.281 By  targeting  a  computer  system  with  more  requests  than  the 
computer system can handle, offenders can prevent users from accessing the computer system, checking 
e-mails, reading the news, booking a flight or downloading files. In 2000, within a short time, several DoS 
attacks were launched against well-known companies such as CNN, eBay and Amazon.282 Similar attacks 
were reported in 2009 on government and commercial websites in the US and South Korea.283 As a result, 
some of the services were not available for several hours and even days.284  
The  prosecution  of  DoS  and  computer-worm  attacks  poses  serious  challenges  to  most  criminal  law 
systems, as these attacks may not involve any physical impact on computer systems. Apart from the basic 

20 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
need  to  criminalize  web-based  attacks,285 the  question  of  whether  the  prevention  and  prosecution  of 
attacks against critical infrastructure needs a separate legislative approach is under discussion.

This category covers content that is considered illegal, including child pornography, xenophobic material 
or insults related to religious symbols.286 The development of legal instruments to deal with this category 
is far more influenced by national approaches, which can take into account fundamental cultural and legal 
principles. For illegal content, value systems and legal systems differ extensively between societies. The 
dissemination of xenophobic material is illegal in many European countries,287 but can be protected by 
the principle of freedom of speech288 in the United States.289 The use of derogatory remarks in respect of 
the Holy Prophet is criminal in many Arabic countries, but not in some European countries.290  
Legal  approaches  to  criminalize  the  illegal  content  should  not  interfere  with  the  right  to  freedom  of 
expression.  The  right  to  freedom  of  expression  is  for  example  defined  by  principle  1  (b)  of  the 
Johannesburg  Principles  on  National  Security  and  Freedom  of  Expression.291 However,  principle  1  (c) 
clarifies that the right to freedom of expression may be subject to restrictions. While a criminalization of 
illegal content is therefore not per se precluded, it has to be strictly limited. Such limitations are especially 
discussed with regard to the criminalization of defamation.292 The 2008 Joint Declaration of the UN Special 
Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Opinion  and  Expression  and  others  points  out  that  vague  notions  such  as 
providing  communications  and  the  glorification  or  promotion  of  terrorism  or  extremism  should  not  be 
criminalized.293 
These legal challenges are complex, as information made available by one computer user in one country 
can be accessed from nearly anywhere in the world.294 If “offenders” create content that is illegal in some 
countries, but not in the country they are operating from, prosecution of the “offenders” is difficult, or 
impossible.295  
There  is  much  lack  of  agreement  regarding  the  content  of  material  and  to  what  degree  specific  acts 
should be criminalized. The different national views and difficulties in prosecuting violations committed 
outside  the  territory  of  an  investigating  country  have  contributed  to  the  blocking  of  certain  types  of 
content on the Internet. Where agreement exists on preventing access to websites with illegal content 
hosted outside the country, states can maintain strict laws, block websites and filter content.296  
There are various approaches to filter systems. One solution requires access providers to install programs 
analysing  the  websites  being  visited  and  to  block  websites  on  a  blacklist.297 Another  solution  is  the 
installation of filter software on users’ computers (a useful approach for parents who wish to control the 
content their children can view, as well as for libraries and public Internet terminals).298 

 

21 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Attempts to control content on the Internet are not limited to certain types of content that are widely 
accepted  to  be  illegal.  Some  countries  use  filter  technology  to  restrict  access  to  websites  addressing 
political  topics.  OpenNet  Initiative299 reports  that  censorship  is  currently  practised  by  about  two  dozen 
countries.300 

Erotic or pornographic material (excluding child pornography) 

2.6.1 
Sexually-related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet, 
which offers advantages to retailers of erotic and pornographic material including: 

•  exchange of media (such as pictures, movies, live coverage) without the need for cost-intensive 

shipping;301 

•  worldwide302 access, reaching a significantly larger number of customers than retail shops;  
• 

the  Internet  is  often  viewed  as  an  anonymous  medium  (often  erroneously303)  –  an  aspect that 
consumers of pornography appreciate, in view of prevailing social opinions. 

Recent research has identified as many as 4.2 million pornographic websites that may be available on the 
Internet at any time.304 Besides websites, pornographic material can be distributed through file-sharing 
systems305 and instant messaging systems.  
Different  countries  criminalize  erotic  and  pornographic  material  to  different  extents.  Some  countries 
permit  the  exchange  of  pornographic  material  among  adults  and  limit  criminalization  to  cases  where 
minors access this kind of material,306 seeking to protect minors.307 Studies indicate that child access to 
pornographic material could negatively influence their development.308 To comply with these laws, “adult 
verification systems” have been developed.309 Other countries criminalize any exchange of pornographic 
material even among adults,310 without focusing on specific groups (such as minors).  
For countries that criminalize interaction with pornographic material, preventing access to pornographic 
material  is  a  challenge.  Beyond  the  Internet,  authorities  can  in  many  instances  detect  and  prosecute 
violations of the prohibition of pornographic material. On the Internet, however, as pornographic material 
is often readily available on servers outside the country, enforcement is difficult. Even where authorities 
are  able  to  identify  websites  containing  pornographic  material,  they  may  have  no  powers  to  enforce 
removal of offensive content by providers.  
The  principle  of  national  sovereignty  does  not  generally  permit  a  country  to  carry  out  investigations 
within  the  territory  of  another  country,  without  permission  from  local  authorities. 311 Even  when 
authorities seek the support of countries where offensive websites are hosted, successful investigation 
and criminal sanctions may be hindered by the principle of “dual criminality”.312  
To prevent access to pornographic content, countries with exceptionally strict laws are often limited to 
prevention (such as filter technology313) to limit access to certain websites.314  

Child pornography 

2.6.2 
The  Internet  has  become  a  prime  channel  for  the  distribution  of  child  pornography.  In  the  1970s  and 
1980s, offenders engaging in the exchange of child pornography faced serious threats.315 At that time, the 
commercial  child  pornography  market  focused  mainly  on  Europe  and  the  US316 and  the  material  was 
locally produced, expensive and difficult to obtain.317 Approaches to buy or sell child pornography entailed 
a number of risks that no longer – or at least not to a degree – exist today. In the past, producers did not 
have  the  capability  to  develop  photography  and  films.318 They  were  dependent  on  services  offered  by 
businesses,  which  increased  the  chances  of  law-enforcement  agents  identifying  child  pornography 
through reports from businesses handling the development.319 The availability of video cameras changed 
this situation for the first time.320 But the risks were not only related to production. Getting access to child 
pornography  was  similarly  fraught  with  risks  for  the  offender.  Orders  were  placed  by  responding  to 
advertisements in newspapers.321 Means of communication between seller and collector, and hence the 
market itself, were limited.322 Until the mid-1990s, child pornography was primarily transported through 

22 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
postal services, and successful investigations led to the detection of a significant number of offenders.323 
In the view of experts, law enforcement was at that time able to meet the challenges.324 
The  situation  changes  dramatically  with  the  availability  of  Internet-based  data-exchange  applications. 
While in the past, law enforcement was confronted with analogue material, today the vast majority of 
discovered material is digital.325 Since the mid-1990s, offenders have increasingly used network services 
for  the  distribution  of  such  material.326 The  resulting  problems  in  terms  of  detecting  and  investigating 
child-pornography cases have been acknowledged.327 The Internet is today the main channel for trading 
regular pornography328 as well as child pornography.329  
Several reasons for the shift from analogue to digital distribution can be identified. The Internet gives less 
technically skilled users the impression they can act invisibly from others. If the offender does not employ 
anonymous communication technology, this impression is erroneous. But the fact that using sophisticated 
means of anonymous communication can hinder the identification of the offender is a matter of concern 
in  respect  of  the  exchange  of  child  pornography  online.330 In  addition,  this  development  has  been 
supported by the decreasing price of technical devices and services used for the production and trading of 
child  pornography,  such  as  recording  equipment  and  hosting  services.331 Since  websites  and  Internet 
services  are  open  to  around  two  billion  Internet  users,  the  number  of  potential  customers  has  also 
expanded.332 There are concerns that the fact that access is easier attracts people who would not have 
taken the risk of being caught trying to obtain child pornography outside the Internet.333 With the shift 
from analogue to digital media, an increasing number of child-pornography images discovered through 
investigations were reported.334 Another aspect that probably supported this development is the fact that 
digital information can in general be duplicated without a loss of quality.335 While in the past consumers 
of child pornography wishing to duplicate and trade the material were hindered by the loss in quality from 
reproduction,  today  a  downloaded  file  can  become  the  source  for  further  duplications.  One  of  the 
consequences of this development is that, even when the offender who produced the material in the first 
place is arrested and his files are confiscated, it becomes difficult to “remove” files once they have been 
traded over the Internet.336  
In  contrast  to  differing  views  on  adult  pornography,  child  pornography  is  broadly  condemned  and 
offences  related  to  child  pornography  are  widely  recognized  as  criminal  acts. 337  International 
organizations are engaged in the fight against online child pornography,338 with several international legal 
initiatives,  including:  the  1989  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child;339 the  2003 
European Union Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child 
pornography;340 and the 2007 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual 
Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, among others.341  
Sadly,  these  initiatives  seeking  to  control  the  network  distribution  of  pornography  have  proved  little 
deterrent to perpetrators, who use the Internet to communicate and exchange child pornography.342 An 
increase in bandwidth has supported the exchange of movies and picture archives.  
Research into the behaviour of child pornography offenders shows that 15 per cent of arrested people 
with  Internet-related  child  pornography  in  their  possession  had  more  than  1 000  pictures  on  their 
computer; 80 per cent had pictures of children aged between 6 and 12 years on their computer;343 19 per 
cent  had  pictures  of  children  younger  than  the  age  of  3344;  and  21  per  cent  had  pictures  depicting 
violence.345 
The  sale  of  child  pornography  is  highly  profitable,346 with  collectors  willing  to  pay  great  amounts  for 
movies and pictures depicting children in a sexual context.347 Search engines find such material quickly.348 
Most  material  is  exchanged  in  password-protected  closed  forums,  which  regular  users  and  law-
enforcement  agencies  can  rarely  access.  Undercover  operations  are  thus  vital  in  the  fight  against  child 
pornography.349  
Two  key  factors  in  the  use  of  ICTs  for  the  exchange  of  child  pornography  act  as  obstacles  to  the 
investigation of these crimes: 

1 

The use of virtual currencies and anonymous payment350 

 

23 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Cash payment enables buyers of certain goods to hide their identity, so cash is dominant in many criminal 
businesses. The demand for anonymous payments has led to the development of virtual payment systems 
and virtual currencies enabling anonymous payment.351 Virtual currencies may not require identification 
and  validation,  preventing  law-enforcement  agencies  from  tracing  money  flows  back  to  offenders. 
Recently, a number of child pornography investigations have succeeded in using traces left by payments 
to identify offenders.352 However, where offenders make anonymous payments, it is difficult for them to 
be  tracked. 353 If  such  anonymous  currencies  are  used  by  criminals  it  restricts  the  ability  of  law 
enforcement  to  identify  suspects  by  following  money  transfers354 –  for  example  in  cases  related  to 
commercial child pornography.355 

The use of encryption technology356 

2 
Perpetrators are increasingly encrypting their messages. Law-enforcement agencies note that offenders 
are using encryption technology to protect information stored on their hard disks,357 seriously hindering 
criminal investigations.358 
In addition to a broad criminalization of acts related to child pornography, other approaches such as the 
implementation  of  obligations  on  Internet  services  to  register  users  or  to  block  or  filter  the  access  to 
websites related to child pornography are currently under discussion.359  

Racism, hate speech, glorification of violence 

2.6.3 
Radical  groups  use  mass  communication  systems  such  as  the  Internet  to  spread  propaganda.360 The 
number of websites offering racist content and hate speech has risen in recent years361 – a study in 2005 
suggested  a  rise  of  25  per  cent  in  the  number  of  webpages  promoting  racial  hatred,  violence  and 
xenophobia between 2004 and 2005.362 In 2006, over 6 000 such websites existed on the Internet.363  
Internet  distribution  offers  several  advantages  for  offenders,  including  lower  distribution  costs,  non-
specialist equipment and a global audience. Examples of incitement-to-hatred websites include websites 
presenting instructions on how to build bombs.364 Besides propaganda, the Internet is used to sell certain 
goods, e.g. Nazi-related items such as flags with symbols, uniforms and books, readily available on auction 
platforms  and  specialized  web-shops.365 The  Internet  is  also  used  to  send  e-mails  and  newsletters  and 
distribute video clips and television shows through popular archives such as YouTube.  
Not  all  countries  criminalize  these  offences.366 In  some  countries,  such  content  may  be  protected  by 
principles of freedom of speech.367 Opinions differ as to how far the principle of freedom of expression 
applies with regard to certain topics, often hindering international investigations. One example of conflict 
of laws is the case involving the service provider Yahoo! in 2001, when a French court ordered Yahoo! 
(based  in  the  US)  to  block  the  access  of  French  users  to  Nazi-related  material.368 Based  on  the  First 
Amendment of the United States Constitution, the sale of such material is legal under United States law. 
Following  the  First  Amendment,  a  US  court  decided  that  the  French  order  was  unenforceable  against 
Yahoo! in the United States.369  
The  disparities  between  countries  on  these  issues  were  evident  during  the  drafting  of  the  Council  of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The Convention on Cybercrime seeks to harmonize cybercrime-related 
laws  to  ensure  that  international  investigations  are  not  hindered  by  conflicts  of  laws.370 Not  all  parties 
engaged in negotiations could agree on a common position on the criminalization of the dissemination of 
xenophobic material, so this entire topic was excluded from the Convention on Cybercrime and instead 
addressed in a separate First Protocol.371 Otherwise, some countries (including the United States) might 
have been unable to sign the Convention on Cybercrime.  

Religious offences 

2.6.4 
A growing number372 of websites present material that is in some countries covered by provisions related 
to  religious  offences,  e.g. anti-religious  written  statements. 373 Although  some  material  documents 
objective  facts  and  trends  (e.g. decreasing  church  attendance  in  Europe),  this  information  may  be 

24 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
considered  illegal  in  some  jurisdictions.  Other  examples  include  the  defamation  of  religions  or  the 
publication of cartoons.  
The Internet offers advantages for those who wish to debate or deal critically with a subject – people can 
leave comments, post material or write articles without having to disclose their identity. Many discussion 
groups are based on the principle of freedom of speech.374 Freedom of speech is a key driver behind the 
Internet’s success, with portals that are used specifically for user-generated content.375 Whilst it is vital to 
protect this principle, even in the most liberal countries the application of principles of freedom of speech 
is governed by conditions and laws. 
The differing legal standards on illegal content reflect the challenges of regulating content. Even where 
the publication of content is covered by provisions relating to freedom of speech in the country where the 
content is available, this material can be accessed from countries with stricter regulations. The “cartoon 
dispute” in 2005 demonstrated the potential for conflict. The publication of twelve editorial cartoons in 
the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten led to widespread protests across the Muslim world.376 
As  with  illegal  content,  the  availability  of  certain  information  or  material  is  a  criminal  offence  in  some 
countries.  The  protection  of  different  religions  and  religious  symbols  differs  from  country  to  country. 
Some countries criminalize the use of derogatory remarks in respect of the Holy Prophet377 or the defiling 
of  copies  of  the  Holy  Quran,378 while  other  countries  may  adopt  a  more  liberal  approach  and  may  not 
criminalize such acts.  

Illegal gambling and online games 

2.6.5 
Internet  games  and  gambling  are  one  of  the  fastest-growing  areas  in  the  Internet.379 Linden  Labs,  the 
developer  of  the  online  game  Second  Life,380 reports  that  some  ten  million  accounts  have  been 
registered.381 Reports  show  that  some  such  games  have  been  used  to  commit  crimes,  including382 the 
exchange and presentation of child pornography,383 fraud,384 gambling in virtual online casinos385 and libel 
(e.g. leaving slanderous or libellous messages).  
Some  estimates  project  growth  in  estimated  online  gambling  revenues  from  USD 3.1 billion  in  2001  to 
USD 24 billion  in  2010  for  Internet  gambling386 (although  compared  with  revenues  from  traditional 
gambling, these estimates are still relatively small387).  
The regulation of gambling over and outside the Internet varies between countries388 – a loophole that 
has  been  exploited  by  offenders,  as  well  as  legal  businesses  and  casinos.  The  effect  of  different 
regulations is evident in Macau. After being returned by Portugal to China in 1999, Macau has become 
one of the world’s biggest gambling destinations. With estimated annual revenues of USD 6.8 billion in 
2006,  it  took  the  lead  from  Las Vegas  (USD 6.6 billion).389 Macau’s  success  derives  from  the  fact  that 
gambling is illegal in China390 and thousands of gamblers travel from Mainland China to Macau to play.  
The  Internet  allows  people  to  circumvent  gambling  restrictions.391 Online  casinos  are  widely  available, 
most of them hosted in countries with liberal laws or no regulations on Internet gambling. Users can open 
accounts online, transfer money and play games of chance.392 Online casinos can also be used in money-
laundering and activities financing terrorism.393 If offenders use online casinos within the laying phase that 
do not keep records or are located in countries without money-laundering legislation, it is difficult for law-
enforcement agencies to determine the origin of funds. 
It is difficult for countries with gambling restrictions to control the use or activities of online casinos. The 
Internet  is  undermining  some  countries’  legal  restrictions  on  access  by  citizens  to  online  gambling.394 
There have been several legislative attempts to prevent participation in online gambling:395 notably, the 
US  Internet  Gambling  Prohibition  Enforcement  Act  of  2006  seeks  to  limit  illegal  online  gambling  by 
prosecuting financial services providers if they carry out settlement of transactions associated with illegal 
gambling.396  

Libel and false information 

2.6.6 
The Internet can be used to spread misinformation, just as easily as information.397 Websites can present 

 

25 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
false  or  defamatory  information,  especially  in  forums  and  chat  rooms,  where  users  can  post  messages 
without  verification  by  moderators.398 Minors  are  increasingly  using  web  forums  and  social  networking 
sites where such information can be posted as well.399 Criminal behaviour400 can include (for example) the 
publication of intimate photographs or false information about sexual behaviours.401 
In most cases, offenders take advantage of the fact that providers offering cheap or free publication do 
not  usually  require  identification  of  authors  or  may  not  verify  ID.402 This  makes  the  identification  of 
offenders  complicated.  Furthermore,  there  may  be  no  or  little  regulation  of  content  by  forum 
moderators.  These  advantages  have  not  prevented  the  development  of  valuable  projects  such  as  the 
online  user-generated  encyclopaedia,  Wikipedia,403 where  strict  procedures  exist  for  the  regulation  of 
content.  However,  the  same  technology  can  also  be  used  by  offenders  to  publish  false  information 
(e.g. about competitors)404 or disclose secret information (e.g. the publication of state secrets or sensitive 
business information). 
It is vital to highlight the increased danger presented by false or misleading information. Defamation can 
seriously injure the reputation and dignity of victims to a considerable degree, as online statements are 
accessible to a worldwide audience. The moment information is published over the Internet, the author 
often  loses  control  of  this  information.  Even  if  the  information  is  corrected  or  deleted  shortly  after 
publication,  it  may  already  have  been  duplicated  (“mirroring”)  and  made  available  by  people  that  are 
unwilling to rescind or remove it. In this case, information may still be available on the Internet, even if it 
has been removed or corrected by the original source.405 Examples include cases of “runaway e-mails”, 
where millions of people can receive salacious, misleading or false e-mails about people or organizations, 
where  the  damage  to  reputations  may  never  be  restored,  regardless  of  the  truth  or  otherwise  of  the 
original e-mail. Therefore the freedom of speech406 and protection of the potential victims of libel needs 
to be well balanced.407  

Spam and related threats 

2.6.7 
“Spam”  describes  the  emission  of  unsolicited  bulk  messages.408 Although  various  scams  exist,  the  most 
common  one  is  e-mail  spam.  Offenders  send  out  millions  of  e-mails  to  users,  often  containing 
advertisements  for  products  and  services,  but  frequently  also  malicious  software.  Since  the  first  spam 
e-mail was sent in 1978,409 the tide of spam e-mails has increased dramatically.410 Today, e-mail provider 
organizations  report that as many as 85 to 90 per cent of all e-mails are spam.411 The main sources of 
spam e-mails in 2007 were: the United States (19.6 per cent of the recorded total); People’s Republic of 
China (8.4 per cent); and the Republic of Korea (6.5 per cent).412  
Most  e-mail  providers  have  reacted  to  rising  levels  of  spam  e-mails  by  installing  anti-spam  filter 
technology.  This  technology  identifies  spam  using  keyword  filters  or  blacklists  of  spammers’  IP 
addresses.413 Although filter technology continues to develop, spammers find ways around these systems 
– for example, by avoiding keywords. Spammers have found many ways to describe “Viagra”, one of the 
most popular products offered in spam, without using the brand name.414  
Success in the detection of spam e-mails depends on changes in the way spam is distributed. Instead of 
sending messages from a single mail server (which is technically easier for e-mail providers to identify, 
due to the limited number of sources415), many offenders use botnets416 to distribute unsolicited e-mails. 
By using botnets based on thousands of computer systems,417 each computer might send out only a few 
hundred  e-mails.  This  makes  it  more  difficult  for  e-mail  providers  to  identify  spam  by  analysing  the 
information about senders and more difficult for law-enforcement agencies to track offenders.  
Spam e-mails are highly profitable as the cost of sending out billions of e-mails is low – and even lower 
where botnets are involved.418 Some experts suggest the only real solution in the fight against spam is to 
raise transmission costs for senders.419 A report published in 2007 analysed the costs and profits of spam 
e-mails.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  analysis,  the  cost  of  sending  out  20  million  e-mails  is  around 
USD 500.420 Since costs for offenders are low, sending spam is highly profitable, especially if offenders are 
able to send billions of e-mails. A Dutch spammer reported a profit of around USD 50 000 by sending out 
at least 9 billion spam e-mails.421  

26 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
In  2005,  the  OECD  published  a  report  analysing  the  impact  of  spam  on  developing  countries.422 
Developing countries often express the view that Internet users in their countries suffer more from the 
impact of spam and Internet abuse. Spam is a serious issue in developing countries, where bandwidth and 
Internet  access  are  scarcer  and  more  expensive  than  in  industrialized  countries.423 Spam  consumes 
valuable time and resources in countries where Internet resources are rarer and more costly. 

2.6.8  Other forms of illegal content 
The Internet is not only used for direct attacks, but also as a forum for soliciting, offers and incitement to 
commit  crimes424 unlawful  sale  of  products  and  providing  information  and  instructions  for  illegal  acts 
(e.g. how to build explosives). 
Many countries have put in place regulations on the trade of certain products. Different countries apply 
different national regulations and trade restrictions to various products such as military equipment.425 A 
similar situation exists for medicines – medicines which are available without restriction in some countries 
may  need  prescription  in  others.426 Cross-border  trade  may  make  it  difficult  to  ensure  that  access  to 
certain products is restricted within a territory.427 Given the popularity of the Internet, this problem has 
grown.  Webshops  operating  in  countries  with  no  restrictions  can  sell  products  to  customers  in  other 
countries with restrictions, undermining these limitations.  
Prior to the Internet, it was difficult for most people to access instructions on how to build weapons. The 
necessary information was available (e.g. in books dealing with chemical aspects of explosives), but time-
consuming  to  find.  Today,  information  on  how  to  build  explosives  is  available  over  the  Internet428 and 
ease of access to information increases the likelihood of attacks.

One of the vital functions of the Internet is the dissemination of information. Companies use the Internet 
to distribute information about their products and services. In terms of piracy, successful companies may 
face problems on the Internet comparable to those that exist outside the network. Their brand image and 
corporate  design  may  be  used  for  the  marketing  of  counterfeit  products,  with  counterfeiters  copying 
logos as well as products and trying to register the domain related to that particular company. Companies 
that  distribute  products  directly  over  the  Internet429 can  face  legal  problems  with  copyright  violations. 
Their products may be downloaded, copied and distributed.

Copyright-related offences 

 
2.7.1 
With the switch from analogue to digital,430 digitization431 has enabled the entertainment industry to add 
additional  features  and  services  to  movies  on  DVD,  including  languages,  subtitles,  trailers  and  bonus 
material. CDs and DVDs have proved more sustainable than records and videotapes.432 
Digitization has opened the door to new copyright violations. The basis for current copyright violations is 
fast and accurate reproduction. Before digitization, copying a record or a videotape always resulted in a 
degree of loss of quality. Today, it is possible to duplicate digital sources without loss of quality, and also, 
as a result, to make copies from any copy. The most common copyright violations include the exchange of 
copyright-protected songs, files and software in file-sharing systems433 or through sharehosting services 
and the circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) systems.434 
File-sharing systems are peer-to-peer435-based network services that enable users to share files,436 often 
with millions of other users.437 After installing file-sharing software, users can select files to share and use 
software  to  search  for  other  files  made  available  by  others  for  download  from  hundreds  of  sources. 
Before file-sharing systems were developed, people copied records and tapes and exchanged them, but 
file-sharing systems permit the exchange of copies by many more users. 
Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology plays a vital role in the Internet. In 2007, over 50 per cent of consumer 
Internet traffic was generated by P2P networks.438 The number of users is growing all the time – a report 
published by the OECD estimates that some 30 per cent of French Internet users have downloaded music 
or  files  in  file-sharing  systems,439 with  other  OECD  countries  showing  similar  trends.440 File-sharing 
systems can be used to exchange any kind of computer data, including music, movies and software.441 
Historically, file-sharing systems have been used mainly to exchange music, but the exchange of videos is 
becoming more and more important.442  
The technology used for file-sharing services is highly sophisticated and enables the exchange of large files 
in short periods of time.443 First-generation file-sharing systems depended on a central server, enabling 
law-enforcement  agencies  to  act  against  illegal  file-sharing  in  the  Napster  network.444 Unlike  first-
generation  systems  (especially  the  famous  Napster  service),  second-generation  file-sharing  systems  are 
no longer based on a central server providing a list of files available between users.445 The decentralized 
concept  of  second-generation  file-sharing  networks  makes  it  more  difficult  to  prevent  them  from 
operating. However, due to direct communications, it is possible to trace users of a network by their IP-
address.446 Law-enforcement  agencies  have  had  some  success  investigating  copyright  violations  in  file-
sharing systems. More recent versions of file-sharing systems enable forms of anonymous communication 
and will make investigations more difficult.447 
File-sharing  technology  is  not  only  used  by  ordinary  people  and  criminals,  but  also  by  regular 
businesses.448 Not all files exchanged in file-sharing systems violate copyrights. Examples of its legitimate 
use include the exchange of authorized copies or artwork within the public domain.449 
Nevertheless,  the  use  of  file-sharing  systems  poses  challenges  for  the  entertainment  industry.450 It  is 
unclear to what extent falls in sales of CD/DVDs and cinema tickets are due to the exchange of titles in 
file-sharing  systems.  Research  has  identified  millions  of  file-sharing  users451 and  billions  of  downloaded 
files.452 Copies  of  movies  have  appeared  in  file-sharing  systems  before  they  were  officially  released  in 
cinemas453 at the cost of copyright-holders. The recent development of anonymous file-sharing systems 
will make the work of copyright-holders more difficult, as well as that of law-enforcement agencies.454  
The entertainment industry has responded by implementing technology designed to prevent users from 
making  copies  of  CDs  and  DVDs  such  as  content  scrambling  systems  (CSS),455 an  encryption  technology 
preventing  content  on  DVDs  from  being  copied.456 This  technology  is  a  vital  element  of  new  business 
models  seeking  to  assign  access  rights  to  users  more  precisely.  Digital  rights  management  (DRM)457 
describes  the  implementation  of  technologies  allowing  copyright-holders  to  restrict  the  use  of  digital 
media,  where  customers  buy  limited  rights  only  (e.g. the  right  to  play  a  song  during  one  party). DRM 
offers  the  possibility  of  implementing  new  business  models  that  reflect  copyright-holders’  and  users’ 
interests more accurately and could reverse declines in profits.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
One  of  the  biggest  difficulties  with  these  technologies  is  that  copyright-protection  technology  can  be 
circumvented.458 Offenders have developed software tools that enable the users to make copy-protected 
files available over the Internet459 free of charge or at low prices. Once DRM protection is removed from a 
file, copies can be made and played without limitation. 
Efforts  to  protect  content  are  not  limited  to  songs  and  films.  Some  TV  stations  (especially  pay-TV 
channels)  encrypt  programmes  to  ensure  that  only  paying  customers  can  receive  the  programme. 
Although protection technologies are advanced, offenders have succeeded in falsifying the hardware used 
as access control or have broken the encryption using software tools.460 
Without  software  tools,  regular  users  are  less  able  to  commit  such  offences.  Discussions  on  the 
criminalization  of  copyright  violations  not  only  focus  on  file-sharing  systems  and  the  circumvention  of 
technical protection, but also on the production, sale and possession of “illegal devices” or tools that are 
designed to enable the users to carry out copyright violations.461  

Trademark-related offences 

2.7.2 
Trademark violations, a well-known aspect of global trade, are similar to copyright violations. Violations 
related  to  trademarks  have  transferred  to  cyberspace,  with  varying  degrees  of  criminalization  under 
different  national  penal  codes.462 The  most  serious  offences  include  the  use  of  trademarks  in  criminal 
activities with the aim of misleading users and domain name related offences. 
The good reputation of a company is often linked directly with its trademarks. Offenders use brand names 
and trademarks fraudulently in a number of activities, including phishing,463 where millions of e-mails are 
sent out to Internet users resembling e-mails from legitimate companies, e.g. including trademarks.464 
A  further  issue  related  to  trademark  violations  is  domain-related  offences465 such  as  cybersquatting,466 
which describes the illegal process of registering a domain name identical or similar to a trademark of a 
product  or  a  company.467 In  most  cases,  offenders  seek  to  sell  the  domain  for  a  high  price  to  the 
company468 or to use it to sell products or services misleading users through their supposed connection to 
the trademark. 469 Another example of a domain-related offence is “domain hijacking” or the registration 
of domain names that have accidentally lapsed.470

Fraud and computer-related fraud 

 
2.8.1 
Computer-related fraud is one of the most popular crimes on the Internet,471 as it enables the offender to 
use automation472 and software tools to mask criminals’ identities. 
Automation enables offenders to make large profits from a number of small acts. 473 One strategy used by 
offenders is to ensure that each victim’s financial loss is below a certain limit. With a “small” loss, victims 
are less likely to invest time and energy in reporting and investigating such crimes.474 One example of such 
a scam is the Nigeria Advanced Fee Fraud.475 
Although these offences are carried out using computer technology, most criminal law systems categorize 
them not as computer-related offences, but as regular fraud.476 The main distinction between computer-
related and traditional fraud is the target of the fraud. If offenders try to influence a person, the offence is 
generally recognized as fraud. Where offenders target computer or data-processing systems, offences are 
often categorized as computer-related fraud. Those criminal law systems that cover fraud, but do not yet 
include  the  manipulation  of  computer  systems  for  fraudulent  purposes,  can  often  still  prosecute  the 
above-mentioned offences. The most common fraud offences include online auction fraud and advanced 
fee fraud. 

Online auction fraud477 
Online auctions are now one of the most popular e-commerce services. In 2006, goods worth more than 
USD 20 billion  were  sold  on  eBay,  the  world’s  largest  online  auction  marketplace.478 Buyers  can  access 
varied or specialist niche goods from around the world. Sellers enjoy a worldwide audience, stimulating 
demand and boosting prices.  
Offenders  committing  crimes  over  auction  platforms  can  exploit  the  absence  of  face-to-face  contact 
between sellers and buyers.479 The difficulty of distinguishing between genuine users and offenders has 
resulted  in  auction  fraud  being  among  the  most  popular  of  cybercrimes.480 The  two  most  common 
methods include481 offering non-existent goods for sale and requesting buyers to pay prior to delivery482 
and buying goods and asking for delivery, with no intention of paying. 
In  response,  auction  providers  have  developed  protection  systems  such  as  the  feedback/comments 
system.  After  each  transaction,  buyer  and  sellers  leave  feedback  for  use  by  other  users483 as  neutral 
information about the reliability of sellers/buyers. In this case, “reputation is everything” and without an 
adequate number of positive comments, it is harder for offenders to persuade targets to either pay for 
non-existent goods or, conversely, to send out goods without receiving payment first. However, criminals 
have  responded  and  circumvented  this  protection  through  using  accounts  from  third  parties.484 In  this 
scam called “account takeover”,485 offenders try to get hold of user names and passwords of legitimate 
users to buy or sell goods fraudulently, making identification of offenders more difficult.  

Advance fee fraud486 
In advance fee fraud, offenders send out e-mails asking for recipients’ help in transferring large amounts 
of money to third parties and promise them a percentage, if they agree to process the transfer using their 
personal  accounts.487 The  offenders  then  ask  them  to  transfer  a  small  amount  to  validate  their  bank 
account data (based on a similar perception as lotteries – respondents may be willing to incur a small but 
certain loss, in exchange for a large but unlikely gain) or just send bank account data directly. Once they 
transfer  the  money,  they  will  never  hear  from  the  offenders  again.  If  they  send  their  bank  account 
information,  offenders  may  use  this  information  for  fraudulent  activities.  Evidence  suggests  that 
thousands  of  targets  reply  to  e-mails.488 Current  researches  show  that,  despite  various  information 
campaigns and initiatives, advance fee frauds are still growing – in terms of both the number of victims 
and total losses.489  

Computer-related forgery 

2.8.2 
Computer-related  forgery  describes  the  manipulation  of  digital  documents.490 The  offence  can  for 
example  be  committed  by  creating  a  document  that  appears  to  originate  from  a  reliable  institution, 

30 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
manipulating  electronic  images  (for  example,  pictures  used  as  evidence  in  court)  or  altering  text 
documents. 
The  falsification  of  e-mails  is  an  essential  element  of  phishing,  which  is  a  serious  challenge  for  law-
enforcement  agencies  worldwide. 491  “Phishing”  seeks  to  make  targets  disclose  personal/secret 
information.492 Often, offenders send out e-mails that look like communications from legitimate financial 
institutions used by the target.493 The e-mails are designed in a way that it is difficult for targets to identify 
them as fake e-mails.494 The e-mail asks recipient to disclose and/or verify certain sensitive information. 
Many  victims  follow  the  advice  and  disclose  information  enabling  offenders  to  make  online  transfers 
etc.495  
In  the  past, prosecutions  involving  computer-related  forgery  were  rare,  because most  legal  documents 
were tangible documents. Digital documents play an ever more important role and are used more often. 
The  substitution  of  classic  documents  by  digital  documents  is  supported  by  legal  means  for  their  use, 
e.g. by legislation recognizing digital signatures.  
Criminals have always tried to manipulate documents. With digital forgeries, digital documents can now 
be copied without loss of quality and are easily manipulated. For forensic experts, it is difficult to prove 
digital manipulations, unless technical protection496 is used to protect a document from being falsified.497 

Identity theft 

2.8.3 
The  term  identity  theft  –  which  is  neither  consistently  defined  nor  consistently  used  –  describes  the 
criminal act of fraudulently obtaining and using another person’s identity.498 These acts can be carried out 
without the help of technical means499 as well as online by using Internet technology.500  
Wide media coverage,501 the results of various surveys analysing the extent of and loss caused by identity 
theft,502 as well as numerous legal and technical analyses503 published in recent years could easily lead to 
the conclusion, that identity-related offences are a 21st-century phenomenon.504 But this is not the case, 
as offences related to impersonation and the falsification and misuse of identity documents have existed 
for  more  than  a  century.505 Already  back in  the  1980s, the  press  intensively  reported  on  the  misuse  of 
identity-related  information.506 The  emerging  use  of  digital  identities  and  information  technology  only 
changed the methods and targets of the offenders.507 Increasing use of digital information opened up new 
possibilities  for  offenders  to  gain  access  to  identity-related  information.508 Thus,  the  transformation 
process from industrialized nations to information societies509 has had a big influence on the development 
of identity-theft offences. Nonetheless, despite the large number of Internet-related identity-theft cases, 
digitization  did  not  fundamentally  change  the  offence  itself,  but  merely  created  new  targets  and 
facilitated the development of new methods.510 The impact of the increasing use of Internet technology 
seems  to  be  overestimated.  Based  on  the  results  of  a  method  analysis  of  identity-related  offences, 
identity theft to a large degree remains an offline crime.511 Less than 20 per cent of the offences in the US 
in  2007512 were  online  scams  and  data  breaches.513 The  persisting  importance  of  offline  crimes  is 
surprising, insofar as the digitization and moreover the globalization of network-based services has led to 
increasing  use  of  digital  identity-related  information. 514 Identity-related  information  is  of  growing 
importance, both in the economy and in social interaction. In the past, a “good name” and good personal 
relations dominated business as well as daily transactions.515 With the transfer to electronic commerce, 
face-to-face  identification  is  hardly  possible,  and  as  a  consequence  identity-related  information  has 
become much more important for people participating in social and economic interaction.516 This process 
can  be  described  as  instrumentalization,517 whereby  an  identity  is  translated  into  quantifiable  identity-
related information. This process, along with the distinction between the more philosophical aspect of the 
term  “identity”  (defined518 as  the  collection  of  personal  characteristics)  and  the  quantifiable  identity-
related information that enables the recognition of a person, is of great importance. The transformation 
process is not just relevant to Internet-related features of identity theft, as the impact of the development 
goes far beyond computer networks. Nowadays, the requirements of non face-to-face transactions, such 
as  trust  and  security,519 dominate  the  economy  in  general  and  not  just  e-commerce  businesses.  An 
example is the use of payment cards with a PIN (personal identification number) for purchasing goods in a 
supermarket.  

 

31 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
In general, the offence described as identity theft contains three different phases.520 In the first phase the 
offender obtains identity-related information. This part of the offence can for example be carried out by 
using  malicious  software  or  phishing  attacks.  The  second  phase  is  characterized  by  interaction  with 
identity-related information prior to the use of the information within criminal offences.521 An example is 
the sale of identity-related information.522 Credit-card records are for example sold for up to USD 60.523 
The third phase is the use of the identity-related information in relation with a criminal offence. In most 
cases,  the  access  to  identity-related  data  enables  the  perpetrator  to  commit  further  crimes.524 The 
perpetrators are therefore not focusing on the set of data itself but the ability to use the data in criminal 
activities.  Examples  for  such  offence  can  be  the  falsification  of  identification  documents  or  credit-card 
fraud. 525 
The methods used to obtain data in phase one cover a wide range of acts. The offender can use physical 
methods,  for  example  stealing  computer  storage  devices  with  identity-related  data,  searching  trash 
(“dumpster  diving”526)  or  mail  theft.527 In  addition,  they  can  use  search  engines  to  find  identity-related 
data.  “Googlehacking”  or  “Googledorks”  are  terms  that  describe  the  use  of  complex  search-engine 
queries  to  filter  through  large  amounts  of  search  results  for  information  related  to  computer  security 
issues as well as personal information that can be used in identity-theft scams. One aim of the perpetrator 
can for example be to search for insecure password protection systems in order to obtain data from the 
system.528 Reports highlight the risks involved with the legal use of search engines for illegal purposes.529 
Similar problems are reported with regard to file-sharing systems. The United States Congress discussed 
recently  the  possibilities  of  exploiting  file-sharing  systems  to  obtain  personal  information  that  can  be 
abused for identity theft.530 Apart from that, the offenders can make use of insiders, who have access to 
stored  identity-related  information,  to  obtain  that  information.  The  2007  CSI  Computer  Crime  and 
Security Survey531 shows that more than 35 per cent of the respondents attribute a percentage of their 
organization’s  losses  greater  than  20  per  cent  to  insiders.  Finally  the  perpetrators  can  use  social 
engineering  techniques  to  persuade  the  victim  to  disclose  personal  information.  In  recent  years 
perpetrators have developed effective scams to obtain secret information (e.g. bank-account information 
and credit-card data) by manipulating users through social engineering techniques.532 
The type of data the perpetrators target varies.533 The most relevant data are social security and passport 
numbers, date of birth, address and phone numbers, and passwords. 

Social security number (SSN) or passport number  
The SSN used, for example, in the United States is a classic example of a single identity-related data item 
that  perpetrators  target.  Although  the  SSN  was  created  to  keep  an  accurate  record  of  earnings,  it  is 
currently  widely  used  for  identification  purposes.534 The  perpetrators  can  use  the  SSN  and  passport 
information to open financial accounts, to take over existing financial accounts, to obtain credit or run up 
debt.535 

Date of birth, address and phone numbers 
Such data can in general only be used to commit identity theft if they are combined with other pieces of 
information (e.g. the SSN).536 Having access to additional information like date of birth and address can 
help  the  perpetrator  to  circumvent  verification  processes.  One  of  the  greatest  dangers  related  to  that 
information  is  the  fact  that  it  is  currently  available  on  a  large  scale  on  the  Internet  –  either  published 
voluntarily  in  one  of  the  various  identity-related  fora537 or  based  on  legal  requirements  as  imprint  on 
websites.538 

Password for non-financial accounts  
Having access to passwords for accounts allows perpetrators to change the settings of the account and 
use it for their own purposes.539 They can for example take over an e-mail account and use it to send out 
mails with illegal content or take over the account of a user of an auction platform and use the account to 
sell stolen goods.540 

32 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Password for financial accounts  
Like the SSN, information regarding financial accounts is a popular target for identity theft. This includes 
cheque  and  saving  accounts,  credit  cards,  debit  cards,  and  financial  planning  information.  Such 
information is an important source for an identity thief to commit financial cybercrimes. 
Identity theft is a serious and growing problem.541 In the first half of 2004, 3 per cent of United States 
households fell victim to identity theft.542 In the United Kingdom, the cost of identity theft to the British 
economy has been calculated at GBP 1.3 billion every year.543 Estimates of losses caused by identity theft 
in Australia vary from less than USD 1 billion to more than USD 3 billion per year.544 The 2006 Identity 
Fraud Survey estimates the losses in the United States at USD 56.6 billion in 2005.545 Losses may be not 
only financial, but may also include damage to reputations.546 In reality, many victims do not report such 
crimes, while financial institutions often do not wish to publicize customers’ bad experiences. The actual 
incidence of identity theft is likely to far exceed the number of reported losses.547  
Identity theft is based on the fact that there are few instruments to verify the identity of users over the 
Internet. It is easier to identify individuals in the real world, but most forms of online identification are 
more complicated. Sophisticated identification tools (e.g. using biometric information) are costly and not 
widely used. There are few limits on online activities, making identity theft easy and profitable.548  

2.8.4  Misuse of devices 
Cybercrime can be committed using only fairly basic equipment.549 Committing offences such as libel or 
online  fraud  needs  nothing  more  than  a  computer  and  Internet  access  and  can  be  carried  out  from  a 
public Internet café. More sophisticated offences can be committed using specialist software tools.  
The  tools  needed  to  commit  complex  offences  are  widely  available  over  the  Internet,550 often  without 
charge. More sophisticated tools  cost several thousand dollars.551 Using these software tools, offenders 
can attack other computer systems at the press of a button. Standard attacks are now less efficient, as 
protection  software  companies  analyse  the  tools  currently  available  and  prepare  for  standard  hacking 
attacks.  High-profile  attacks  are  often  individually  designed  for  specific  targets.552 Software  tools553 are 
available that enable the offender to carry out DoS attacks554, design computer viruses, decrypt encrypted 
communication or illegally access computer systems. 
A second generation of software tools has now automated many cyberscams and enables offenders to 
carry  out  multiple  attacks  within  a  short  time.  Software  tools  also  simplify  attacks,  allowing  less 
experienced  computer  users  to  commit  cybercrime.  Spam-toolkits  are  available  that  enable  virtually 
anybody to send out spam e-mails.555 Software tools are now available that can be used to upload and 
download  files  from  file-sharing  systems.  With  greater  availability  of  specially-designed  software  tools, 
the number of potential offenders has risen dramatically. Different national and international legislative 
initiatives  are  being  undertaken  to  address  such  software  tools  –  for  example,  by  criminalizing  their 
production, sale or possession.556

There are several terms used to describe complex scams that combine a number of different offences. 
Examples include terrorist use of the Internet, cyberlaundering and phishing. 

International 

Terrorist use of the Internet  

2.9.1 
In  the  1990s,  discussion  about  the  use  of  the  network  by  terrorist  organizations  focused  on  network-
based attacks against critical infrastructure such as transportation and energy supply (“cyberterrorism”) 
and  the  use  of  information  technology  in  armed  conflicts  (“cyberwarfare”).557 The  success  of  virus  and 
botnet  attacks  has  clearly  demonstrated  weaknesses  in  network  security.  Successful  Internet-based 
attacks by terrorists are possible,558 but it is difficult to assess the significance of threats559. Back then, the 
degree of interconnection was small compared to nowadays, and it is very likely that this – apart from the 
interest of the states to keep successful attacks confidential – is one of the main reasons why very few 
such incidents were reported. At least in the past, therefore, falling trees posed a greater risk for energy 
supply than successful hacking attacks.560  
This situation changed after the 9/11 attacks, which prompted the start of an intensive discussion about 
the  use  of  ICTs  by  terrorists.561 This  discussion  was  facilitated  by  reports562 that  the  offenders  used  the 
Internet in their preparation of the attack.563 Although the attacks were not cyberattacks, insofar as the 
group that carried out the 9/11 attack did not carry out an Internet-based attack, the Internet played a 
role in the preparation of the offence.564 In this context, different ways in which terrorist organizations use 
the Internet were discovered.565 Today, it is known that terrorists use ICTs and the Internet for:  

information gathering 

•  propaganda 
• 
•  preparation of real-world attacks 
•  publication of training material 
• 
• 
•  attacks against critical infrastructures. 

communication 
terrorist financing 

This shift in the focus of the discussion had a positive effect on research related to cyberterrorism as it 
highlighted areas of terrorist activities that were rather unknown before. But despite the importance of a 
comprehensive approach, the threat of Internet-related attacks against critical infrastructure should not 
be removed from the central focus of the discussion. The vulnerability of and the growing reliance566 on 
information  technology  makes 
Internet-related  attacks  against  critical 
infrastructure in strategies to prevent and fight cyberterrorism.  
Despite  the  more  intensive  research,  however,  the  fight  against  cyberterrorism  remains  difficult.  A 
comparison of the different national approaches shows many similarities in the strategies.567 One of the 
reasons for this development is the fact that the international communities recognized that the threats of 
international  terrorism  require  global  solutions.568 But  it  is  currently  uncertain  if  this  approach  is 

it  necessary  to 

include 

34 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
successful or if the different legal systems and different cultural backgrounds require different solutions. 
An evaluation of this issue carries unique challenges because apart from reports about major incidents 
there are very few data available that could be used for scientific analysis. The same difficulties arise with 
regard to the determination of the level of threat related to the use of information technology by terrorist 
organizations.  This  information  is  very  often  classified  and  therefore  only  available  to  the  intelligence 
sector.569 Not even a consensus on the term “terrorism” has yet been achieved.570 A CRS report for the 
United States Congress for example states that the fact that one terrorist booked a flight ticket to the 
United States via the Internet is proof that terrorists used the Internet in preparation of their attacks.571 
This seems to be a vague argumentation, as the booking of a flight ticket does not become a terrorist-
related activity just because it is carried out by a terrorist. 

Propaganda 
In 1998, only 12 out of the 30 foreign terrorist organizations that are listed by the United States State 
Department maintained websites to inform the public about their activities.572 In 2004, the United States 
Institute of Peace reported that nearly all terrorist organizations maintain websites – among them Hamas, 
Hezbollah, PKK and Al Qaida.573 Terrorists have also started to use video communities (such as YouTube) 
to distribute video messages and propaganda.574 The use of websites and other forums are signs of a more 
professional  public  relations  focus  of  subversive  groups.575 Websites  and  other  media  are  used  to 
disseminate propaganda,576 to describe and publish justifications577 of their activities and to recruit578 new 
and  contact  existing  members  and  donors.579 Websites  have  been  used  recently  to  distribute  videos  of 
executions.580 

Information gathering 
Considerable information about possible targets is available over the Internet.581 For example, architects 
involved in the construction of public buildings often publish plans of buildings on their websites. Today, 
high-resolution satellite pictures are available free of change on various Internet services that years ago 
were only available to very few military institutions in the world.582. Instructions on how to build bombs 
and even virtual training camps that provide instructions on the use of weapons in an e-learning approach 
have  been  discovered. 583 In  addition,  sensitive  or  confidential  information  that  is  not  adequately 
protected  from  search  robots  can  be  accessed  via  search  engines.584 In  2003,  the  United  States 
Department of Defense was informed that a training manual linked to Al Qaeda contained information 
that public sources could be used to find details about potential targets.585 In 2006, the New York Times 
reported  that  basic  information  related  to  the  construction  of  nuclear  weapons  were  published  on  a 
government website that provided evidence about the Iraq approaches to develop nuclear weapons. 586 A 
similar incident was reported in Australia, where detailed information about potential targets for terrorist 
attacks  was  available  on  government  websites.  587 In  2005,  the  press  in  Germany  reported  that 
investigators found that manuals on how to build explosives were downloaded from the Internet onto the 
computer of two suspects that tried to attack public transportation with self-built bombs.588  

Preparation of real-world attacks 
There are different ways that terrorists can make use of information technology in preparing their attack. 
Sending out e-mails or using forums to leave messages are examples that will be discussed in the context 
of  communication.  Here  more  direct  ways  of  online  preparation  are  discussed.  Reports  have  been 
published which point out that terrorists are using online games in the preparation of attacks.589 There are 
various different online games available that simulate the real world. A player of such games can make 
use of characters (avatar) to act in this virtual world. Theoretically, these online games could be used to 
simulate  attacks,  but  it  is  not  yet  certain  to  what  extent  online  games  are  already  involved  in  that 
activity.590  

Publication of training material 
The Internet can be used to spread training material such as instructions on how to use weapons and how 
to select targets. Such material is available on a large scale from online sources.591 In 2008, Western secret 

 

35 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
services discovered an Internet server that provided a basis for the exchange of training material as well 
as  communication.592 Different  websites  were  reported  to  be  operated  by  terrorist  organizations  to 
coordinate activities.593  

Communication 
The  use  of  information  technology  by  terrorist  organizations  is  not  limited  to  running  websites  and 
research in databases. In the context of the investigations after the 9/11 attacks, it was reported that the 
terrorists  used  e-mail  communication  for  coordination  of  their  attacks.594 The  press  reported  on  the 
exchange  via e-mail  of  detailed  instructions  about  the  targets  and  the  number of  attackers.595 By  using 
encryption technology and means of anonymous communication, the communicating parties can make it 
even more difficult to identify and monitor terrorist communication.  

Terrorist financing 
Most terrorist organizations depend on financial resources they receive from third parties. Tracing back 
these financial transactions has become one of the major approaches in the fight against terrorism after 
the  9/11  attacks.  One  of  the  main  difficulties  in  this  respect  is  the  fact  that  the  financial  resources 
required to carry out attacks are not necessarily large.596 There are several ways in which Internet services 
can be used for terrorist financing. Terrorist organizations can make use of electronic payment systems to 
enable online donations.597 They can use websites to publish information how to donate, e.g. which bank 
account  should  be  used  for  transactions.  An  example  of  such  an  approach  is  the  organization 
“Hizb al-Tahrir”, which published bank-account information for potential donors.598 Another approach is 
the implementation of online credit-card donations. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was one of the first 
terrorist organizations that collected donations via credit card.599 Both approaches carry the risk that the 
published information will be discovered and used to trace back financial transactions. It is therefore likely 
that  anonymous  electronic  payment  systems  will  become  more  popular.  To  avoid  discovery,  terrorist 
organizations  are  trying  to  hide  their  activities  by  involving  non-suspicious  players  such  as  charity 
organizations.  Another  (Internet-related)  approach  is  the  operation  of  fake  webshops.  It  is  relatively 
simple to set up an online shop on the Internet. One of the biggest advantages of the network is the fact 
that businesses can be operated worldwide. Proving that financial transactions that took place on those 
sites are not regular purchases but donations is not at all easy. It would be necessary to investigate every 
transaction – which can be difficult if the online shop is operated in a different jurisdiction or anonymous 
payment systems are used.600 

Attacks against critical infrastructures 
In addition to regular computer crimes such as fraud and identity theft, attacks against critical information 
infrastructures could become a goal for terrorists. The growing reliance on information technology makes 
critical  infrastructure  more  vulnerable  to  attacks.601 This  is  especially  the  case  with  regard  to  attacks 
against  interconnected  systems  that  are  linked  by  computer  and  communication  networks.602 In  those 
cases, the disruption caused by a network-based attack goes beyond the failure of a single system. Even 
short interruptions to services could cause huge financial damage to e-commerce businesses – not only 
for civil services but also for military infrastructure and services.603 Investigating or even preventing such 
attacks presents unique challenges.604 Unlike physical attacks, the offenders do not need to be present at 
the place where the effect of the attack occurs.605 And while carrying out the attack the offenders can use 
means  of  anonymous  communication  and  encryption  technology  to  conceal  their  identity. 606  As 
highlighted  above,  investigating  such  attacks  requires  special  procedural  instruments,  investigation 
technology and trained personnel.607  
Critical infrastructure is widely recognized as a potential target for terrorist attacks as it is by definition 
vital for a state’s sustainability and stability.608 An infrastructure is considered to be critical if its incapacity 
or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defence or economic security of a state.609 These 
are  in  particular:  electrical  power  systems,  telecommunication  systems,  gas  and  oil  storage  and 
transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems and emergency services. The 
degree of civil disturbance caused by the disruption of services by Hurricane Katrina in the United States 

36 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
highlights  the  dependence  of  society  on  the  availability  of  those  services.610 The  malicious  software 
“Stuxnet”  underlines  the  emerging  threat  posed  by  Internet-based  attacks  focusing  on  critical 
infrastructure.611 In 2010, a security firm in Belarus discovered a new malicious software.612 Research into 
the manipulations caused by the software, the designer and the motivation is still ongoing and by far not 
all the facts have been discovered, especially in regard to attribution and motivation of the designer.613 
However, especially with regard to the functioning of the software, there seems to be a rather solid fact 
basis by now: 
The  complex  software,  with  more  than  4 000  functions,614 was  reported  to  target  industrial  control 
systems (ICS)615 – in particular those produced by the technology company Siemens.616 It was distributed 
through  removable  drives  and  used  four  zero-day  exploits  for  the  infection  of  computer  systems.617 
Infected computer systems have mainly been reported from Iran, Indonesia and Pakistan, but also from 
the US and European countries.618 Although the malicious software is frequently characterized as highly 
sophisticated, there are reports that question the degree of sophistication.619 
As indicated above, the determination of attribution and motive is more difficult and still highly uncertain. 
News  reports  and  studies  speculate  that  the  software  could  have  targeted  the  uranium  enrichment 
facilities in Iran and caused a delay in the country’s nuclear programme.620 
Two main conclusions can be drawn from the discovery of the malicious software. First of all, the incident 
underlines  that  critical  infrastructure  is  largely  dependent  on  computer  technology  and  attacks  are 
possible. Secondly, the fact that the software was distributed among other methods, through removable 
drives highlights that simply disconnecting computer systems from the Internet does not prevent attacks. 
The dependence of critical infrastructure on ICT goes beyond the energy and nuclear industry. This can be 
demonstrated by highlighting some of incidents related to air transportation, which is in most countries 
also considered part of the critical infrastructure. One potential target of an attack is the check-in system. 
The  check-in  systems  of  most  airports  in  the  world  are  already  based  on  interconnected  computer 
systems.621 In 2004, the Sasser computer worm622 infected millions of computers around the world, among 
them computer systems of major airlines, which forced the cancellation of flights.623  
Another potential target is online ticketing systems. Today, a significant number of tickets are purchased 
online. Airlines use information technology for various operations. All major airlines allow their customers 
to buy tickets online. Like other e-commerce activities, those online services can be targeted by offenders. 
One common technique used to attack web-based services is denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.624 In 2000, 
within a short time, several DoS attacks were launched against well-known companies such as CNN, e-Bay 
and  Amazon.625 As  a  result,  some  of  the  services  were  not  available  for  several  hours  or  even  days.626 
Airlines have been affected by DoS attacks as well. In 2001 the Lufthansa website was the target of an 
attack.627  
Finally,  a  further  potential  target  for  Internet-related  attacks  against  critical  air  transportation 
infrastructure  is  the  airport  control  system.  The  vulnerability  of  computer-controlled  flight  control 
systems was demonstrated by a hacking attack against Worcester Airport in the US in 1997.628 During the 
hacking  attack,  the  offender  disabled  phone  services  to  the  airport  tower  and  shut  down  the  control 
system managing the runway lights.629  

Cyberwarfare 

2.9.2 
After  the  attacks  against  computer  systems  in  Estonia  in  2007  and  Georgia  in  2008  and  more  recently 
after  the  discovery  of  the  “Stuxnet”630 computer  virus,  the  term  cyberwarfare  has  frequently  been 
employed to describe the situation although – as described more in detail below – the use of terminology 
is problematic.  

Terminology and definitions 
There is neither a consistent terminology nor a widely accepted definition of cyberwarfare. Other terms 
used  are  information  warfare,  electronic  warfare,  cyberwar,  netwar,  information  operations.631 Those 
terms are in general employed to describe the utilization of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet. 

 

37 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
More  restrictive  definitions  define  such  activities  as  an  approach  to  armed  conflict  focusing  on  the 
management  and  use  of  information  in  all  its  forms  and  at  all  levels  to  achieve  a  decisive  military 

advantage  especially  in  the  joint  and  combined  environment.632 Other,  broader  definitions  cover  any 
electronic conflict in which information is a strategic asset worthy of conquest or destruction.633 

Development of the debate 
The topic has been a controversial matter of discussion for decades.634 Attention originally focused on the 
substitution  of  classic  warfare  by  computer-mediated  or  computer-based  attacks.635 In  this  regard,  the 
ability to take down any enemy without getting involved in a fight was one of the key components at the 
heart  of  the  debate  from  the  outset.636 In  addition,  network-based  attacks  are  generally  cheaper  than 
traditional military operations637 and can be carried out even by small states. Despite some concrete cases 
that are often quoted, major aspects of the debate remain highly hypothetical.638 The two instances that 
are most frequently cited are computer attacks against Estonia and Georgia. However, the classification of 
an attack as an act of war requires that certain criteria be fulfilled.  
In 2007, Estonia experienced heated debate over the removal of a Second World War memorial, including 
street  riots  in  the  capital.639 Apart  from  traditional  forms  of  protest,  Estonia  at  that  time  discovered 
several waves of computer-related attacks against government and private business websites and online 
services640,  including  defacement  of  websites641,  attacks  against  domain  name  servers  and  distributed 
denial of service attacks (DDoS), where botnets were used.642 With regard to the latter, experts explained 
afterwards that successful attacks against the official website of governmental organizations in Estonia643 
could only take place due to inadequate protection measures.644 The impact of the attacks as well as their 
origin  were  subsequently  the  subject  of  controversial  discussion.  While  news  reports645 and  articles646 
indicated that the attacks came close to shutting down the country’s digital infrastructure, more reliable 
research shows that the impact of the attacks was limited in terms of both the computer systems affected 
and  the  duration  of  unavailability  of  services. 647  Similar  debate  took  place  with  regard  to  the 
determination of the origin of the attack. While during the attack the territory of the Russian Federation 
was reported to be the origin of the attack648, analysis of the attacks showed that they in fact involved 
more than 170 countries.649 Even if politically motivated, an attack does not necessarily constitute an act 
of war. As a consequence, the Estonia case needs to be excluded from the list. Despite being computer-
related  attacks  against  government  and  private  business  websites  and  online  services650,  including 
defacement  of  websites651 and  distributed  denial  of  service  attacks  (DDoS)652,  such  attacks  cannot  be 
characterized as cyberwarfare as they neither constituted an act of force nor took place during a conflict 
between two sovereign states.  
Of the two above-mentioned attacks, the 2008 attack on computer systems in Georgia is the closest to 
being war-related. In the context of a traditional armed conflict653 between the Russian Federation and 
Georgia,  several  computer-related  attacks  targeting  Georgian  government  websites  and  businesses654 
(including the defacement of websites and distributed denial of service attacks) were discovered.655 Just 
as  in  the  Estonian  incident,  the  origin  of  the  attack  against  Georgia  was  much  debated  afterwards. 
Although  some  news  reports656 seemed  to  pinpoint  the  geographic  origin  of  the  attack,  technology-
focused  research  points  to  the  use  of  botnets,  which  makes  the  origin  much  more  difficult  to 
determine.657 The  inability  to  determine  the  origin  of  the  attacks  together  with  the  fact  that  the  acts 
discovered  differ  significantly  from  traditional  warfare  makes  it  difficult  to  characterize  them  as 
cyberwarfare.  
Inasmuch as the debate about this phenomenon is quite important, it should be pointed out that such 
attacks are not an unprecedented phenomenon. Propaganda is spread through the Internet and attacks 
against computer systems of military alliances are a rather common concept. Already during the war in 
Yugoslavia,  attacks  against  NATO  computer  systems  originating  from  Serbia  were  discovered.658 In 
response, NATO Member States were reported to have been involved in similar attacks against computer 
systems in Serbia.659 Further computer-related propaganda and other forms of psychological operations 
(PSYOPS) designed to undermine the other side’s resolve were intensively utilized.660  

38

Importance of differentiation  
Potentially war-related acts show many similarities to other forms of abuse of ICT, such as cybercrime and 
terrorist use of the Internet. As a consequence, the terms “cybercrime”, “terrorist use of the Internet” 
and “cyberwarfare” are frequently used interchangeably. But a differentiation is of great importance since 
the  applicable  legal  frameworks  differ  significantly.  While  cybercrime  is  in  general  addressed  by  acts 
criminalizing  such  conduct,  the  rules  and  procedures  related  to  warfare  are  largely  regulated  by 
international law, and particularly the Charter of the United Nations. 

Cyberlaundering 

2.9.3 
The  Internet  is  transforming  money-laundering.  For  larger  amounts,  traditional  money-laundering 
techniques still offer a number of advantages, but the Internet offers several advantages. Online financial 
services offer the option of enacting multiple, worldwide financial transactions very quickly. The Internet 
has  helped  overcome  the  dependence  on  physical  monetary  transactions.  Wire  transfers  replaced  the 
transport of hard cash as the original first step in suppressing physical dependence on money, but stricter 
regulations  to  detect  suspicious  wire  transfers  have  forced  offenders  to  develop  new  techniques.  The 
detection of suspicious transactions in the fight against money-laundering is based on obligations of the 
financial institutions involved in the transfer.661  
Money-laundering is generally divided into three phases: placement, layering and integration.  
With regard to the placement of large amounts of cash, the use of the Internet might perhaps not offer 
that many tangible advantages.662 However, the Internet is especially useful for offenders in the layering 
(or  masking)  phase.  In  this  context,  the  investigation  of  money-laundering  is  especially  difficult  when 
money-launderers use online casinos for layering.663  
The regulation of money transfers is currently limited and the Internet offers offenders the possibility of 
cheap and tax-free money transfers across borders.  Current difficulties in the investigation of Internet-
based money-laundering techniques often derive from the use of virtual currencies and the use of online 
casinos. 

The use of virtual currencies 
One  of  the  key  drivers  in  the  development  of  virtual  currencies  were  micro-payments  (e.g. for  the 
download of online articles costing USD 0.10 or less), where the use of credit cards is problematic. With 
the  growing  demand  for  micro-payments,  virtual  currencies,  including  “virtual  gold  currencies”,  were 
developed. Virtual gold currencies are account-based payment systems where the value is backed by gold 
deposits. Users can open e-gold accounts online, often without registration. Some providers even enable 
direct  peer-to-peer  (person-to-person)  transfer  or  cash  withdrawals.664 Offenders  can  open  e-gold 
accounts  in  different  countries  and  combine  them,  complicating  the  use  of  financial  instruments  for 
money-laundering  and  terrorist  financing.  Account-holders  may  also  use  inaccurate  information  during 
registration to mask their identity.665  
In  addition  to  simple  virtual  currencies  there  are  also  currencies  that  combine  the  virtual  aspect  with 
anonymity.  One  example  is  Bitcoin,  a  virtual  currency  using  peer-to-peer  technology.666 Although  it  is  a 
decentralized systems that does not require central intermediaries to ensure the validity of transactions 
authorities successful attacks in 2011 underline the vulnerability/risks related to such decentralized virtual 
currencies. 667 If  such  anonymous  currencies  are  used  by  criminals  it  restricts  the  ability  of  law 
enforcement  to  identify  suspects  by  following  money  transfers668 –  for  example  in  cases  related  to 
commercial child pornography.669 

The use of online casinos 
Unlike a real casino, large financial investments are not needed to establish online casinos.670 In addition, 
the regulations on online and offline casinos often differ between countries.671 Tracing money transfers 
and proving that funds are not prize winnings, but have instead been laundered, is only possible if casinos 
keep records and provide them to law-enforcement agencies. 

 

39 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Current  legal  regulation  of  Internet-based  financial  services  is  not  as  stringent  as  traditional  financial 
regulation.  Apart  from  gaps  in  legislation,  difficulties  in  regulation  arise  from  challenges  in  customer 
verification,  since  accurate  verification  may  be  compromised,  if  the  financial  service  provider  and 
customer  never  meet.672 In  addition,  the  lack  of  personal  contact  makes  it  difficult  to  apply  traditional 
know-your-customer  procedures.  Furthermore,  the  Internet  transfers  often  involve  the  cross-border 
participation  of  providers  in  various  countries.  Finally  monitoring  transactions  is  particularly  difficult  if 
providers allow customers to transfer value in a peer-to-peer model.  

Phishing 

2.9.4 
Offenders have developed techniques to obtain personal information from users, ranging from spyware673 
to  “phishing”  attacks. 674 “Phishing”  describes  acts  that  are  carried  out  to  make  victims  disclose 
personal/secret information.675 There are different types of phishing attacks,676 but e-mail-based phishing 
attacks contain three major phases. In the first phase, offenders identify legitimate companies offering 
online  services  and  communicating  electronically  with  customers  whom  they  can  target,  e.g. financial 
institutions.  Offenders  design  websites  resembling  the  legitimate  websites  (“spoofing  sites”)  requiring 
victims  to  perform  normal  log  in  procedures,  enabling  offenders  to  obtain  personal  information 
(e.g. account numbers and online banking passwords).  
In  order  to  direct  users  to  spoofing  sites,  offenders  send  out  e-mails  resembling  e-mails  from  the 
legitimate company,677 often resulting in trademark violations.678 The false e-mails ask recipients to log in 
for  updates  or  security  checks,  sometimes  with  threats  (e.g. to  close  the  account)  if  users  do  not 
cooperate. The false e-mail generally contains a link that victim should follow to the spoof site, to avoid 
users  manually  entering  the  correct  web  address  of  the  legitimate  bank.  Offenders  have  developed 
advanced techniques to prevent users from realizing that they are not on the genuine website.679  
As soon as personal information is disclosed, offenders log in to victims’ accounts and commit offences 
such  as  the  transfer  of  money,  application  for  passports  or  new  accounts,  etc.  The  rising  number  of 
successful attacks proves phishing’s potential.680 More than 55 000 unique phishing sites were reported to 
APWG681 in April 2007.682 Phishing techniques are not limited to accessing passwords for online banking 
only. Offenders may also seek access codes to computers, auction platforms and social security numbers, 
which are particularly important in the United States and can give rise to “identity theft” offences.683

188  Regarding the development of computer systems, see: Hashagen, The first Computers – History and Architectures. 
189  See in this context, for example, the Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 81: 

“The purpose of this article is to create a parallel offence to the forgery of tangible documents. It aims at filling gaps in 
criminal law related to traditional forgery, which requires visual readability of statements, or declarations embodied in 
a document and which does not apply to electronically stored data. Manipulations of such data with evidentiary value 
may have the same serious consequences as traditional acts of forgery if a third party is thereby misled. Computer-
related forgery involves unauthorised creating or altering stored data so that they acquire a different evidentiary value 
in the course of legal transactions, which relies on the authenticity of information contained in the data, is subject to a 
deception.” 

190  From a legal perspective, there is no real need to differentiate between “computer hackers” and “computer crackers” 
as – in the context of illegal access – both terms are used to describe persons who enter a computer system without 
right. The main difference is the motivation. The term “hacker” is used to describe a person who enjoys exploring the 
details of programmable systems, without breaking the law. The term “cracker” is used to describe a person who breaks 
into computer systems in general by violating the law.  

191  In the early years of IT development, the term “hacking” was used to describe the attempt to get more out of a system 
(software or hardware) than it was designed for. Within this context, the term “hacking” was often used to describe a 
constructive activity.

199  Hacking into a computer system and modifying information on the first page to prove the ability of the offender can – 
depending on the legislation in place – be prosecuted as illegal access and data interference. For more information, see 
below: § 6.2.1 and § 6.2.4.  

200  The term “hacktivism” combines the words hack and activism. It describes hacking activities performed to promote a 
political ideology. For more information, see: Anderson, Hacktivism and Politically Motivated Computer Crime, 2005,

220  One example of this is the German Criminal Code, which criminalized only the act of obtaining data (Section 202a) until 

2007, when the provision was changed. The following text is taken from the old version of Section 202a – Data 
Espionage:  
(1) Whoever, without authorization, obtains data for himself or another, which was not intended for him and was 
specially protected against unauthorized access, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or 
a fine.  
(2) Within the meaning of subsection (1), data shall only be those which stored or transmitted electronically or 
magnetically or otherwise in a not immediately perceivable manner.

personal/secret information. The term originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial 
data from a sea of Internet users. The use of “ph” linked to popular hacker naming conventions. See: Gercke, Computer 
und Recht, 2005, page 606; Ollmann, The Phishing Guide Understanding & Preventing Phishing Attacks, available at:

cases that involve encryption technology, see below: § 3.2.14.

242  It is easy to identify credit-card numbers, as they in general contain 16 digits. By excluding phone numbers using 

country codes, offenders can identify credit-card numbers and exclude mistakes to a large extent.  

243  One approach to gain access to a computer system in order to install a keylogger is, for example, to gain access to the 
building where the computer is located using social engineering techniques, e.g. a person wearing a uniform from the 
fire brigade pretending to check emergency exits has a good chance of gaining access to a building, if more extensive 
security is not in place. Further approaches can be found in Mitnick, The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human 
Element of Security, 2002.  

244  Regular hardware checks are a vital part of any computer security strategy.

287  One example of the wide criminalization of illegal content is Sec. 86a German Penal Code. The provision criminalizes the 

use of symbols of unconstitutional parties: Section 86a: Use of Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations: 

 

 

(1) Whoever: 1. domestically distributes or publicly uses, in a meeting or in writings (Section 11 subsection (3)) 
disseminated by him, symbols of one of the parties or organizations indicated in Section 86 subsection (1), nos. 1, 2 
and 4; or 2. produces, stocks, imports or exports objects which depict or contain such symbols for distribution or use 
domestically or abroad, in the manner indicated in number 1, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than 
three years or a fine.  
(2) Symbols, within the meaning of subsection (1), shall be, in particular, flags, insignia, uniforms, slogans and forms of 
greeting. Symbols which are so similar as to be mistaken for those named in sentence 1 shall be deemed to be 
equivalent thereto.  
(3) Section 86 subsections (3) and (4), shall apply accordingly. 

 
288  Regarding the principle of freedom of speech, see: Tedford/Herbeck/Haiman, Freedom of Speech in the United States, 
2005; Barendt, Freedom of Speech, 2007; Baker; Human Liberty and Freedom of Speech; Emord, Freedom, Technology 
and the First Amendment, 1991. Regarding the importance of the principle with regard to electronic surveillance, see:

289  Concerns over freedom of expression (e.g. the First Amendment to the United States Constitution) explain why certain 
acts of racism were not made illegal by the Convention on Cybercrime, but their criminalization was included in the First 
Additional Protocol. See Explanatory Report to the First Additional Protocol, No. 4.  

290  The 2006 Joint Declaration of the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE 

Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression points out that “in 
many countries, overbroad rules in this area are abused by the powerful to limit non-traditional, dissenting, critical, or 
minority voices, or discussion about challenging social issues”. In 2008 the Joint Declaration highlights that international 
organizations, including the United Nations General Assembly and Human Rights Council, should desist from the further 
adoption of statements supporting the idea of defamation of religions.

292  The 2002 Joint Declaration of the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE 

Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression points out that 
“defamation is not a justifiable restriction on freedom of expression; all criminal defamation laws should be abolished 
and replaced, where necessary, with appropriate civil defamation laws”.

463  The term “phishing” describes an act that is carried out to make targets disclose personal/secret information. The term 
originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of Internet users. The use 
of “ph.” linked to popular hacker naming conventions. See Gecko, The criminalization of Phishing and Identity Theft, 
Computer und Resht, 2005, 606; Ullman, “The Phishing Guide: Understanding & Preventing Phishing Attacks”, available 
at: www.nextgenss.com/papers/NISR-WP-Phishing.pdf. For more information, see below: § 2.9.4.

465  Regarding the connection with trademark-related offences, see for example: Explanatory Report to the Convention on 

Cybercrime, No. 42.  

466  Another term used to describe the phenomenon is “domain grabbing”. Regarding cybersquatting, see: Hansen-Young,

467  See: Lipton, Beyond cybersquatting: taking domain name disputes past trademark policy, 2005, available at: 

www.law.wfu.edu/prebuilt/w08-lipton.pdf. 

468  This happens especially with the introduction of new top-level-domains. To avoid cybersquatting, the introduction of a 

new first-level domain is often accompanied by a period where only parties with trademarks can register a domain 
name. At the end of this phase (often called the “sunrise period”), other users can register their domain.  

469  For case examples, see: Sieber, Council of Europe Organised Crime Report 2004, page 112. 
470  For case examples, see: Sieber, Council of Europe Organised Crime Report 2004, page 113. 
471  In 2006, the United States Federal Trade Commission received nearly 205 000 Internet-related fraud complaints. See 

Consumer Fraud and Identity Theft Complaint Data, January – December 2006, Federal Trade Commission, available at:

474  Regarding the related automation process: § 3.2.8. 
475  The term “advance fee fraud” describes offences in which offenders seek to convince targets to advance a small sum of 

money in the hope of receiving a much larger sum afterwards. For more information, see: Reich, Advance Fee Fraud

493  “Phishing” scams show a number of similarities to spam e-mails. It is likely that those organized crime groups that are 

involved in spam are also involved in phishing scams, as they have access to spam databases. Regarding spam, see 
above: § 2.6.7.

495  For more information about phishing scams, see below: § 2.9.4.

499  One of the classic examples is the search for personal or secret information in trash or garbage bins (“dumpster 

diving”). For more information about the relation to identity theft, see: Putting an End to Account-Hijacking identity

500  Javelin Strategy & Research 2006 Identity Fraud Survey points out that although there were concerns over electronic 

methods of obtaining information, most thieves still obtain personal information through traditional rather than 
electronic channels. In the cases where the methods were known, less than 15 per cent obtained online by electronic 
means. See Javelin Strategy & Research 2006 Identity Fraud Survey, Consumer Report, available at:

547  The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) requested companies not to keep quiet about phishing attacks 

and attacks on company IT systems, but to inform authorities, so that they can be better informed about criminal 
activities on the Internet. The Head of the FBI office in New York is quoted as saying: “It is a problem for us that some 
companies are clearly more worried about bad publicity than they are about the consequences of a successful hacker 
attack”. See: Heise News, available at: www.heise-security.co.uk/news/80152.

559  The CIA pointed out in 2002 that attacks against critical infrastructure in the United States will become an option for 

terrorists. Regarding the CIA position, see: Rollins/Wilson, Terrorist Capabilities for Cyberattack, 2007, page 13, 
available at: www.fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/RL33123.pdf. However, the FBI has stated that there is presently a lack of 
capability to mount a significant cyberterrorism campaign. Regarding the FBI position, see: Nordeste/Carment, A

675  The term “phishing” originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of 
Internet users. The use of “ph” linked to popular hacker naming conventions. See Gercke, Computer und Recht, 2005,

676  The following section describes e-mail-based phishing attacks, compared to other phishing scams, which may, for 
example, be based on voice communications. See: Gonsalves, Phishers Snare Victims with VoIP, 2006, available at: 
www.techweb.com/wire/security/186701001. 

677  “Phishing” shows a number of similarities to spam e-mails. It is thus likely that organized crime groups that are involved 
in spam are also involved in phishing scams, as they make use of the same spam databases. Regarding spam, see above:

Recent developments in ICTs have not only resulted in new cybercrimes and new criminal methods, but 
also  new  methods  of  investigating  cybercrime.  Advances  in  ICTs  have  greatly  expanded  the  abilities  of 
law-enforcement agencies. Conversely, offenders may use new tools to prevent identification and hamper 
investigation. This chapter focuses on the challenges of fighting cybercrime.  

3.1  Opportunities  

Law-enforcement agencies can now use the increasing power of computer systems and complex forensic 
software to speed up investigations and automate search procedures.684  
It  can  prove  difficult  to  automate  investigation  processes.  While  a  keyword-based  search  for  illegal 
content  can  be  carried  out  easily,  the  identification  of  illegal  pictures  is  more  problematic.  Hash-value 
based approaches are only successful if pictures have been rated previously, the hash value is stored in a 
database and the picture that was analysed has not been modified.685 
Forensic software is able to search automatically for child-pornography images by comparing the files on 
the hard disk of suspects with information about known images. For example, in late 2007, authorities 

74 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
found a number of pictures of the sexual abuse of children. In order to prevent identification the offender 
had digitally modified the part of the pictures showing his face before publishing the pictures over the 
Internet. Computer forensic experts were able to unpick the modifications and reconstruct the suspect’s 
face.686 Although  the  successful  investigation  clearly  demonstrates  the  potential  of  computer  forensics, 
this  case  is  no  proof  of  a  breakthrough  in  child-pornography  investigation.  If  the  offender  had  simply 
covered his face with a white spot, identification would have been impossible.  

3.2  General challenges 

Reliance on ICTs 

3.2.1 
Many  everyday  communications  depend  on  ICTs  and  Internet-based  services,  including  VoIP  calls  or  e-
mail  communications. 687 ICTs  are  now  responsible  for  the  control  and  management  functions  in 
buildings,688 cars  and  aviation  services.689 The  supply  of  energy,  water  and  communication  services 
depend on ICTs. The further integration of ICTs into everyday life is likely to continue.690 Growing reliance 
on  ICTs  makes  systems  and  services  more  vulnerable  to  attacks  against  critical  infrastructures.691 Even 
short interruptions to services could cause huge financial damages to e-commerce businesses.692 It is not 
only civil communications that could be interrupted by attacks; the dependence on ICTs is a major risk for 
military communications.693 
Existing technical infrastructure has a number of weaknesses, such as the monoculture or homogeneity of 
operating systems. Many private users and SMEs use Microsoft’s operating system,694 so offenders can 
design effective attacks by concentrating on this single target.695  
The dependence of society on ICTs is not limited to the western countries696. Developing countries also 
face  challenges  in  preventing  attacks  against  their  infrastructure  and  users.697 The  development  of 
cheaper infrastructure technologies such as WiMAX698 has enabled developing countries to offer Internet 
services to more people. Developing countries can avoid the mistakes of some western countries, which 
have  concentrated  mainly  on  maximizing  accessibility,  without  investing  significantly  in  protection.  US 
experts have explained that successful attacks against the official website of governmental organizations 
in Estonia699 could only take place due to inadequate protection measures.700 Developing countries have a 
unique  opportunity  to  integrate  security  measures  early  on.  This  may  require  greater  upfront 
investments, but the integration of security measures at a later point may prove more expensive in the 
long run.701 
Strategies  must  be  formulated  to  prevent  such  attacks  and  develop  countermeasures,  including  the 
development  and  promotion  of  technical  means  of  protection,  as  well  as  adequate  and  sufficient  laws 
enabling law-enforcement agencies to fight cybercrime effectively.702 

3.2.2  Number of users 
The popularity of the Internet and its services is growing fast, with over 2 billion Internet users worldwide 
by 2010.703 Computer companies and ISPs are focusing on developing countries with the greatest potential 
for  further  growth.704 In  2005,  the  number  of  Internet  users  in  developing  countries  surpassed  the 
number in industrial nations,705 while the development of cheap hardware and wireless access will enable 
even more people to access the Internet.706  
With  the  growing  number  of  people  connected  to  the  Internet,  the  number  of  targets  and  offenders 
increases.707 It is difficult to estimate how many people use the Internet for illegal activities. Even if only 
0.1 per cent of users committed crimes, the total number of offenders would be more than one million. 
Although Internet usage rates are lower in developing countries, promoting cybersecurity is not easier, as 
offenders can commit offences from around the world.708  
The increasing number of Internet users causes difficulties for the law-enforcement agencies because it is 
relatively difficult to automate investigation processes. While a keyword-based search for illegal content 

 

75 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
can  be  carried  out  rather  easily,  the  identification  of  illegal  pictures  is  more  problematic.  Hash-value 
based approaches are for example only successful if the pictures were rated previously, the hash value 
was stored in a data base, and the picture that was analysed has not been modified.709  

Availability of devices and access 

3.2.3 
Only basic equipment is needed to commit computer crimes. Committing an offence requires hardware, 
software and Internet access.  
With  regard  to  hardware,  the  power  of  computers  is  growing  continuously.710 There  are  a  number  of 
initiatives  to  enable  people  in  developing  countries  to  use  ICTs  more  widely.711 Criminals  can  commit 
serious computer crimes with only cheap or second-hand computer technology – knowledge counts for 
far more than equipment. The date of the computer technology available has little influence on the use of 
that equipment to commit cybercrimes. 
Committing  cybercrime  can  be  made  easier  through  specialist  software  tools.  Offenders  can  download 
software  tools712 designed  to  locate  open  ports  or  break  password  protection.713 Due  to  mirroring 
techniques and peer-to-peer exchange, it is difficult to limit the widespread availability of such devices.714  
The  last  vital  element  is  Internet  access.  Although  the  cost  of  Internet  access715 is  higher  in  most 
developing  countries  than  in  industrialized  countries,  the  number  of  Internet  users  in  developing 
countries is growing rapidly.716 Offenders will generally not subscribe to an Internet service to limit their 
chances of being identified, but prefer services they can use without (verified) registration. A typical way 
of getting access to networks is the so-called “wardriving”. The term describes the act of driving around 
searching for accessible wireless networks.717 The most common methods criminals can use to access the 
network fairly anonymously are public Internet terminals, open (wireless) networks718, hacked networks 
and prepaid services without registration requirements. 
Law-enforcement agencies are taking action to restrict uncontrolled access to Internet services to avoid 
criminal  abuse  of  these  services.  In  Italy  and  China,  for  example,  the  use  of  public  Internet  terminals 
requires  the  identification  of  users. 719 However,  there  are  arguments  against  such  identification 
requirements.720 Although the restriction of access could prevent crimes and facilitate the investigations 
of law-enforcement agencies, such legislation could hinder the growth of the information society and the 
development of e-commerce.721  
It  has  been  suggested  that  this  limitation  on  access  to  the  Internet  could  violate  human  rights.722 For 
example, the European Court has ruled in a number of cases on broadcasting that the right to freedom of 
expression  applies  not  only  to  the  content  of  information,  but  also  to  the  means  of  transmission  or 
reception. In the case Autronic v. Switzerland,723 the court held that extensive interpretation is necessary 
since  any  restriction  imposed  on  the  means  necessarily  interferes  with  the  right  to  receive  and  impart 
information. If these principles are applied to potential limitations on Internet access, it is possible that 
such legislative approaches could entail violation of human rights.  

Availability of information 

3.2.4 
The Internet has millions of webpages724 of up-to-date information. Anyone who publishes or maintains a 
webpage  can  participate.  One  example  of  the  success  of  user-generated  platforms  is  Wikipedia,725 an 
online encyclopaedia where anybody can publish.726  
The success of the Internet also depends on powerful search engines that enable users to search millions 
of  webpages  in  seconds.  This  technology  can  be  used  for  both  legitimate  and  criminal  purposes. 
“Googlehacking”  or  “Googledorks”  describes  the  use  of  complex  search-engine  queries  to  filter  many 
search results for information on computer security issues. For example, offenders might aim to search 
for  insecure  password  protection  systems.727 Reports  have  highlighted  the  risk  of  the  use  of  search 
engines  for  illegal  purposes.728 An  offender  who  plans  an  attack  can  find  detailed  information  on  the 
Internet  that  explains  how  to  build  a  bomb  using  only  chemicals  available  in  regular  supermarkets.729 
Although  information  like  this  was  available  even  before  the  Internet  was  developed,  it  was  however, 

76 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
much more difficult to get access to that information. Today, any Internet user can get access to those 
instructions.  
Criminals  can  also  use  search  engines  to  analyse  targets.730 A  training  manual  was  found  during 
investigations against members of a terrorist group highlighting how useful the Internet is for gathering 
information  on  possible  targets. 731 Using  search  engines,  offenders  can  collect  publicly  available 
information  (e.g. construction  plans  from  public  buildings)  that  help  in  their  preparations.  It  has  been 
reported  that  insurgents  attacking  British  troops  in  Afghanistan  used  satellite  images  from  Google 
Earth.732  

3.2.5  Missing mechanisms of control 
All mass communication networks – from phone networks used for voice phone calls to the Internet – 
need central administration and technical standards to ensure operability. The ongoing discussions about 
Internet  governance  suggest  that  the  Internet  is  no  different  compared  with  national  and  even 
transnational communication infrastructure.733 The Internet also needs to be governed by laws, and law-
makers  and  law-enforcement  agencies  have  started  to  develop  legal  standards  necessitating  a  certain 
degree of central control.  
The  Internet  was  originally  designed  as  a  military  network 734 based  on  a  decentralized  network 
architecture that sought to preserve the main functionality intact and in power, even when components 
of the network were attacked. As a result, the Internet’s network infrastructure is resistant to external 
attempts at control. It was not originally designed to facilitate criminal investigations or to prevent attacks 
from inside the network.  
Today, the Internet is increasingly used for civil services. With the shift from military to civil services, the 
nature of demand for control instruments has changed. Since the network is based on protocols designed 
for military purposes, these central control instruments do not exist and it is difficult to implement them 
retrospectively, without significant redesign of the network. The absence of control instruments makes 
cybercrime investigations very difficult.735  
One  example  of  the  problems  posed  by  the  absence  of  control  instruments  is  the  ability  of  users  to 
circumvent filter technology736 using encrypted anonymous communication services.737 If access providers 
block certain websites with illegal content (such as child pornography), customers are generally unable to 
access those websites. But the blocking of illegal content can be avoided, if customers use an anonymous 
communication  server  encrypting  communications  between  them  and  the  central  server.  In  this  case, 
providers  may  be  unable  to  block  requests  because  requests  sent  as  encrypted  messages  cannot  be 
opened by access providers.  

International dimensions  

3.2.6 
Many  data  transfer  processes  affect  more  than  one  country.738 The  protocols  used  for  Internet  data 
transfers  are  based  on  optimal  routing  if  direct  links  are  temporarily  blocked.739 Even  where  domestic 
transfer processes within the source country are limited, data can leave the country, be transmitted over 
routers outside the territory and be redirected back into the country to the final destination.740 Further, 
many Internet services are based on services from abroad741, e.g. host providers may offer webspace for 
rent in one country based on hardware in another.742  
If offenders and targets are located in different countries, cybercrime investigations need the cooperation 
in  all  countries  affected. 743  National  sovereignty  does  not  permit 
of 
investigations  within  the  territory  of  different  countries  without  the  permission  of  local  authorities.744 
Cybercrime investigations need the support and involvement of authorities in all countries involved.  
It is difficult to base cooperation in cybercrime on principles of traditional mutual legal assistance. The 
formal requirements and time needed to collaborate with foreign law-enforcement agencies often hinder 
investigations.745 Investigations  often  occur  in  very  short  time-frames.746 Data  vital  for  tracing  offences 
are  often  deleted  after  only  a  short  time.  This  short  investigation  period  is  problematic,  because

traditional  mutual  legal  assistance  regime  often  takes  time  to  organize. 747 The  principle  of  dual 
criminality748 also poses difficulties, if the offence is not criminalized in one of the countries involved in 
the  investigation.749 Offenders  may be  deliberately  including  third  countries  in  their  attacks  in  order  to 
make investigation more difficult.750 
Criminals  may  deliberately  choose  targets  outside  their  own  country  and  act  from  countries  with 
inadequate  cybercrime  legislation.751 The  harmonization  of  cybercrime-related  laws  and  international 
cooperation  would  help.  Two  approaches  to  improve  the  speed  of  international  cooperation  in 
cybercrime  investigations  are  the  G8  24/7  Network752 and  the  provisions  related  to  international 
cooperation in the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.753  

Independence of location and presence at the crime site 

3.2.7 
Criminals need not be present at the same location as the target. As the location of the criminal can be 
completely different from the crime site, many cyberoffences are transnational. International cybercrime 
offences take considerable effort and time. Cybercriminals seek to avoid countries with strong cybercrime 
legislation.754  
Preventing  “safe  havens”  is  one  of  the  key  challenges  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime.755 While  “safe 
havens” exist, offenders will use them to hamper investigation. Developing countries that have not yet 
implemented cybercrime legislation may become vulnerable, as criminals may choose to base themselves 
in  these  countries  to  avoid  prosecution.  Serious  offences  affecting  victims  all  over  the  world  may  be 
difficult to stop, due to insufficient legislation in the country where offenders are located. This may lead 
to  pressure  on  specific  countries  to  pass  legislation.  One  example  of  this  is  the  “Love  Bug”  computer 
worm  developed  by  a  suspect  in  the  Philippines  in  2000,756 which  infected  millions  of  computers 
worldwide.757 Local  investigations  were  hindered  by  the  fact  that  the  development  and  spreading  of 
malicious software was not at that time adequately criminalized in the Philippines.758 Another example is 
Nigeria, which has come under pressure to take action over financial scams distributed by e-mail. 

Automation 

3.2.8 
One  of  the  greatest  advantages  of  ICTs  is  the  ability  to  automate  certain  processes.  Automation  has 
several  major  consequences:  It  increases  the  speed  of  processes  as  well  as  the  scale  and  impact  of 
processes and finally limits the involvement of humans. 
Automation reduces the need for cost-intensive manpower, allowing providers to offer services at lower 
prices.759 Offenders  can  use  automation  to  scale  up  their  activities  –  many  millions  of  unsolicited  bulk 
spam760 messages  can  be  sent  out  by  automation.761 Hacking  attacks  are  often  also  now  automated, 762 
with as many as 80 million hacking attacks every day763 due to the use of software tools764 that can attack 
thousands of computer systems in hours.765 By automating processes offenders can gain great profit by 
designing scams that are based on a high number of offences with a relatively low loss for each victim.766 
The lower the single loss, the higher is the chance that the victim will not report the offence.  
Automation of attacks affects developing countries in particular. Due to their limited resources, spam may 
pose  a  more  serious  issue  for  developing  countries  than  for  industrialized  countries.767 The  greater 
numbers  of  crimes  that  can  be  committed  through  automation  pose  challenges  for  law-enforcement 
agencies worldwide, as they will have to be prepared for many more victims within their jurisdictions.  

Resources 

3.2.9 
Modern computer systems that are now coming onto the market are powerful and can be used to extend 
criminal activities. But it is not just increasing power768 of single-user computers that poses problems for 
investigations. Increasing network capacities is also a major issue.  
One  example  is  the  recent  attacks  against  government  websites  in  Estonia.769 Analysis  of  the  attacks 
suggests  that  they  were  committed  by  thousands  of  computers  within  a  “botnet”770 or  group  of 
compromised  computers  running  programs  under  external  control.771 In  most  cases,  computers  are 

78 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
infected with malicious software that installs tools allowing perpetrators to take control. Botnets are used 
to gather information about targets or for high-level attacks.772  
Over recent years, botnets have become a serious risk for cybersecurity.773 The size of a botnet can vary, 
from a few computers to more than a million computers.774 Current analysis suggests that up to a quarter 
of  all  computers  connected  to  the  Internet  could  be  infected  with  software  making  them  part  of  a 
botnet.775 Botnets can be used for various criminal activities, including denial of service attacks,776 sending 
out spam,777 hacking attacks and the exchange of copyright-protected files.  
Botnets  offer  a  number  of  advantages  for  offenders.  They  increase  both  the  computer  and  network 
capacity of criminals. Using thousands of computer systems, criminals can attack computer systems that 
would be out of reach with only a few computers to lead the attack.778 Botnets also make it more difficult 
to trace the original offender, as the initial traces only lead to the member of the botnets. As criminals 
control more powerful computer systems and networks, the gap between the capacities of investigating 
authorities and those under control of criminals is getting wider.  

3.2.10  Speed of data exchange processes 
The transfer of an e-mail between countries takes only a few seconds. This short period of time is one 
reason for the success of the Internet, as e-mails have eliminated the time for the physical transport of a 
message.  However,  this  rapid  transfer  leaves  little  time  for  law-enforcement  agencies  to  investigate  or 
collect evidence. Traditional investigations take much longer.779  
One example is the exchange of child pornography. In the past, pornographic videos were handed over or 
transported to buyers. Both the handover and transport gave law-enforcement agencies the opportunity 
to investigate. The main difference between the exchange of child pornography on and off the Internet is 
transportation. When offenders use the Internet, movies can be exchanged in seconds.  
E-mails also demonstrate the importance of immediate response tools that can be used immediately. For 
tracing and identifying suspects, investigators often need access to data that may be deleted shortly after 
transfer.780 A  very  short  response  time  by  the  investigative  authorities  is  often  vital  for  a  successful 
investigation. Without adequate legislation and instruments allowing investigators to act immediately and 
prevent data from being deleted, an effective fight against cybercrime may not be possible.781  
“Quick  freeze  procedures”782 and  24/7  network  points783 are  examples  of  tools  that  can  speed  up 
investigations.  Data  retention  legislation  also  aims  to  increase  the  time  available  for  law-enforcement 
agencies to carry out investigations. If the data necessary to trace offenders are preserved for a length of 
time, law-enforcement agencies have a better chance of identifying suspects successfully. 

3.2.11  Speed of development  
The Internet is constantly undergoing development. The creation of a graphical user interface (WWW784) 
marked the start of its dramatic expansion, as previous command-based services were less user-friendly. 
The  creation  of  the  WWW  has  enabled  new  applications,  as  well  as  new  crimes785.  Law-enforcement 
agencies are struggling to keep up. Further developments continue, notably with online games and voice 
over IP (VoIP) communication.  
Online games are ever more popular, but it is unclear whether law-enforcement agencies can successfully 
investigate and prosecute offences committed in this virtual world.786  
The  switch  from  traditional  voice  calls  to  Internet  telephony  also  presents  new  challenges  for  law-
enforcement agencies. The techniques and routines developed by law-enforcement agencies to intercept 
classic phone calls do not generally apply to VoIP communications. The interception of traditional voice 
calls  is  usually  carried  out  through  telecom  providers.  Applying  the  same  principle  to  VoIP,  law-
enforcement  agencies  would  operate  through  ISPs  and  service  providers  supplying  VoIP  services. 
However, if the service is based on peer-to-peer technology, service providers may generally be unable to 
intercept  communications,  as  the  relevant  data  are  transferred  directly  between  the  communicating 
partners.787 Therefore, new techniques are needed.788  

 

79 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
New  hardware  devices  with  network  technology  are  also  developing  rapidly.  The  latest  home 
entertainment  systems  turn  TVs  into  Internet  access  points,  while  more  recent  mobile  handsets  store 
data and connect to the Internet via wireless networks.789 USB (universal serial bus) memory devices with 
more than 1 GB capacity have been integrated into watches, pens and pocket knives. Law-enforcement 
agencies need to take these developments into account in their work – it is essential to educate officers 
involved in cybercrime investigations continuously, so they are up to date with the latest technology and 
able to identify relevant hardware and any specific devices that need to be seized.  
Another  challenge  is  the  use  of  wireless  access  points.  The  expansion  of  wireless  Internet  access  in 
developing  countries  is  an  opportunity,  as  well  as  a  challenge  for  law-enforcement  agencies.790 If 
offenders  use  wireless  access  points  that  do  not  require  registration,  it  is  more  challenging  for  law-
enforcement agencies to trace offenders, as investigations lead only to access points.  

3.2.12  Anonymous communications 
Determining  the  origin  of  communication  is  very  often  a  key  component  of  cybercrime  investigation. 
However,  the  distributed  nature  of  the  network791,  as  well  the  availability  of  certain  Internet  services, 
which create uncertainty of origin, make it difficult to identify offenders.792 The possibility of anonymous 
communication  can  be  either  just  a  by-product  of  a  service  or  offered  with  the  intention  of  avoiding 
disadvantages  for  the  user.  Being  mindful  of  uncertainty  of  origin  is  crucial  to  prevent  incorrect 
conclusions.793 Examples of such services – which can even be combined – are:  
•  public Internet terminals (e.g. at airport terminals or Internet cafés);794  
•  network address translation (NAT) devices and virtual private networks (VPN);795 
•  wireless networks;796 
•  prepaid mobile services that do not need registration; 
• 
•  anonymous communication servers;797 
•  anonymous remailers.798 

storage capacities for homepages offered without registration; 

Offenders  can  hide  their  identities  through,  for  example,  the  use  of  fake  e-mail  addresses.799 Many 
providers  offer  free  e-mail  addresses.  Where  personal  information  has  to  be  entered,  it  may  not  be 
verified,  so  users  can  register  e-mail  addresses  without  revealing  their  identity.  Anonymous  e-mail 
addresses  can  be  useful  e.g. if  users  wish  to  join  political  discussion  groups  without  identification. 
Anonymous communications may give rise to anti-social behaviour, but they can also allow users to act 
more freely.800  
Given  that  users  leave  various  traces,  there  is  a  need  for  instruments  to  protect  them  from  profiling 
activities.801 Therefore,  various  states  and  organizations  support  the  principle  of  anonymous  use  of 
Internet  e-mail  services.  This  principle  is  expressed,  for  instance,  in  the  European  Union  Directive  on 
Privacy and Electronic Communications.802 One example of a legal approach to protect user privacy can be 
found in Article 37 of the European Union Regulation on Data Protection.803 However, some countries are 
addressing the challenges of anonymous communications by implementing legal restrictions.804 Italy, for 
instance, requires public Internet access providers to identify users before they start using the service.805  
These measures aim to help law-enforcement agencies identify suspects, but they can be easily avoided. 
Criminals  may  use  unprotected  private  wireless  networks  or  SIM-cards  from  countries  not  requiring 
registration. It is unclear whether the restriction of anonymous communications and anonymous access 
to the Internet should play a more important role in cybersecurity strategies.806  

3.2.13  Failure of traditional investigation instruments 
Investigating  and  prosecuting  cybercrime  requires  Internet-specific  tools  and  instruments  that  enable 
competent authorities to carry out investigations.807 In this context, instruments to identify the offender 

80 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
and collect the evidence required for the criminal proceedings are essential.808 These instruments may be 
the same as those used in traditional terrorist investigations unrelated to computer technology. But in a 
growing  number  of  Internet-related  cases,  traditional  investigation  instruments  are  not  sufficient  to 
identify an offender. One example is the interception of voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication.809 In recent 
decades,  states  have  developed  investigation  instruments,  such  as  wiretapping,  that  enable  them  to 
intercept landline as well as mobile-phone communications.810 The interception of traditional voice calls is 
usually carried out through telecom providers.811 Applying the same principle to VoIP, law-enforcement 
agencies  would  operate  through  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  and  service  providers  supplying  VoIP 
services. However, if the service is based on peer-to-peer technology, service providers may generally be 
unable  to 
is  transferred  directly  between  the 
communicating  partners.812 Therefore,  new  technical  solutions  together  with  related  legal  instruments 
are necessary. 

intercept  communications,  as  the  relevant  data 

3.2.14  Encryption technology 
Another  factor  that  can  complicate  the  investigation  of  cybercrime  is  encryption  technology,813 which 
protects  information  from  access  by  unauthorized  people  and  is  a  key  technical  solution  in  the  fight 
against cybercrime.814 Encryption is a technique of turning a plain text into an obscured format by using 
an algorithm.815 Like anonymity, encryption is not new,816 but computer technology has transformed the 
field. For a long time it was subject to secrecy. In an interconnected environment, such secrecy is difficult 
to maintain.817  
The widespread availability of easy-to-use software tools and the integration of encryption technology in 
the operating systems818 now makes it possible to encrypt computer data with the click of a mouse and 
thereby increases the chance of law-enforcement agencies being confronted with encrypted material.819 
Various software products are available that enable users to protect files against unauthorized access.820 
But it is uncertain to what extent offenders already use encryption technology to mask their activities.821 
One survey on child pornography suggested that only 6 per cent of arrested child-pornography possessors 
used  encryption  technology822,  but  experts  highlight  the  threat  of  an  increasing  use  of  encryption 
technology in cybercrime cases.823 
There are different technical strategies to cover encrypted data and several software tools are available to 
automate these processes.824 Strategies range from analysing825 weakness in the software tools used to 
encrypt  files,826 searching  for  encryption  passphrases827 and  trying  typical  passwords,  to  complex  and 
lengthy brute-force attacks. The term “brute-force attack” is used to describe the process of identifying a 
code  by  testing  every  possible  combination.828 Depending  on  encryption  technique  and  key  size,  this 
process  could  take  decades.829 For  example,  if  an  offender  uses  encryption  software  with  a  20-bit 
encryption,  the  size  of  the  keyspace  is  around  one  million.  Using  a  current  computer  processing  one 
million  operations  per  second,  the  encryption  could  be  broken  in  less  than  one  second.  However,  if 
offenders use a 40-bit encryption, it could take up to two weeks to break the encryption.830 In 2002, the 
Wall Street Journal was for example able to successfully decrypt files found on an Al Qaeda computer that 
were encrypted with 40-bit encryption.831 Using a 56-bit encryption, a single computer would take up to 
2 285  years  to  break  the  encryption.  If  offenders  use  a  128-bit  encryption,  a  billion  computer  systems 
operating solely on the encryption could take thousands of billions years to break it.832 The latest version 
of the popular encryption software PGP permits 1 024-bit encryption.  
Current  encryption  software  goes  far  beyond  the  encryption  of  single  files.  The  latest  version  of 
Microsoft’s  operating  systems,  for  example,  allows  the  encryption  of  an  entire  hard  disk.833 Users  can 
easily  install  encryption  software.  Although  some  computer  forensic  experts  believe  that  this  function 
does  not  threaten  them,834 the  widespread  availability  of  this  technology  for  any  user  could  result  in 
greater use of encryption. Tools are also available to encrypt communications – for example, e-mails and 
phone calls835 – that can be sent using VoIP.836 Using encrypted VoIP technology, offenders can protect 
voice conversations from interception.837  
Techniques can also be combined. Using software tools, offenders can encrypt messages and exchange 
them in pictures or images – this technology is called steganography.838 For investigative authorities, it is 

 

81 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
difficult  to  distinguish  the  harmless  exchange  of  holiday  pictures  and  the  exchange  of  pictures  with 
encrypted hidden messages.839  
The  availability  and  use  of  encryption  technologies  by  criminals  is  a  challenge  for  law-enforcement 
agencies.  Various  legal  approaches  to  address  the  problem  are  currently  under  discussion,840 including: 
potential  obligations  for  software  developers  to  install  a  back-door  for  law-enforcement  agencies; 
limitations on key strength; and obligations to disclose keys, in the case of criminal investigations.841 But 
encryption technology is not only used by offenders – there are various ways such technology is used for 
legal purposes. Without adequate access to encryption technology, it may be difficult to protect sensitive 
information.  Given  the  growing  number  of  attacks,842 self-protection  is  an  important  element  of 
cybersecurity.  

3.2.15  Summary 
The  investigation  and  prosecution  of  cybercrime  presents  a  number  of  challenges  for  law-enforcement 
agencies. It is vital not only to educate the people involved in the fight against cybercrime, but also to 
draft  adequate  and  effective  legislation.  This  section  has  reviewed  key  challenges  to  promoting 
cybersecurity  and  areas  where  existing  instruments  may  prove  insufficient  and  the  implementation  of 
special instruments may be necessary. 

3.3 

Legal challenges 

Challenges in drafting national criminal laws 

3.3.1 
Proper legislation is the foundation for the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. However, law-
makers must continuously  respond to Internet developments and monitor the effectiveness of existing 
provisions, especially given the speed of developments in network technology.  
Historically, the introduction of computer-related services or Internet-related technologies has given rise 
to new forms of crime, soon after the technology was introduced. One example is the development of 
computer networks in the 1970s – the first unauthorized access to computer networks occurred shortly 
afterwards.843 Similarly,  the  first  software  offences  appeared  soon  after  the  introduction  of  personal 
computers in the 1980s, when these systems were used to copy software products. 
It takes time to update national criminal law to prosecute new forms of online cybercrime. Indeed, some 
countries have not yet finished with this adjustment process. Offences that have been criminalized under 
national  criminal  law  need  to  be  reviewed  and  updated.  For  example,  digital  information  must  have 
equivalent status as traditional signatures and printouts.844 Without the integration of cybercrime-related 
offences, violations cannot be prosecuted. 
The main challenge for national criminal legal systems is the delay between the recognition of potential 
abuses  of  new  technologies  and  necessary  amendments  to  the  national  criminal  law.  This  challenge 
remains as relevant and topical as ever as the speed of network innovation accelerates. Many countries 
are working hard to catch up with legislative adjustments.845 In general, the adjustment process has three 
steps: adjustment to national law, identification of gaps in the penal code, and drafting of new legislation.  

Adjustments to national law must start with the recognition of an abuse of new technology 
Specific  departments  are  needed  within  national  law-enforcement  agencies,  which  are  qualified  to 
investigate potential cybercrimes. The development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs),846 
computer incident response teams (CIRTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and other 
research facilities have improved the situation.  

Identification of gaps in the penal code 
To  ensure  effective  legislative  foundations,  it  is  necessary  to  compare  the  status  of  criminal  legal 
provisions in the national law with requirements arising from the new kinds of criminal offences. In many 
cases,  existing  laws  may  be  able to  cover  new  varieties  of  existing  crimes  (e.g. laws  addressing  forgery 

82 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
may just as easily be applied to electronic documents). The need for legislative amendments is limited to 
those offences that are omitted or insufficiently covered by the national law.  

Drafting of new legislation 
Based  on  experience,  it  may  be  difficult  for  national  authorities  to  execute  the  drafting  process  for 
cybercrime without international cooperation, due to the rapid development of network technologies and 
their complex structures.847 Drafting cybercrime legislation separately may result in significant duplication 
and waste of resources, and it is also necessary to monitor the development of international standards 
and  strategies.  Without  the  international  harmonization  of  national  criminal  legal  provisions,  the  fight 
against  transnational  cybercrime  will  run  into  serious  difficulties,  due  to  inconsistent  or  incompatible 
national legislations. Consequently, international attempts to harmonize different national penal laws are 
increasingly  important.848 National  law  can  greatly  benefit  from  the  experience  of  other  countries  and 
international expert legal advice. 

3.3.2  New offences 
In  most  cases,  crimes  committed  using  ICTs  are  not  new  crimes,  but  scams  modified  to  be  committed 
online. One example is fraud – there is not much difference between someone sending a letter with the 
intention to mislead another person and an e-mail with the same intention.849 If fraud is already a criminal 
offence, adjustment of national law may not be necessary to prosecute such acts.  
The situation is different if the acts performed are no longer addressed by existing laws. In the past, some 
countries  had  adequate  provisions  for  regular  fraud,  but  were  unable  to  deal  with  offences  where  a 
computer  system  was  influenced,  rather  than  a  human.  For  these  countries,  it  has  been  necessary  to 
adopt new laws criminalizing computer-related fraud, in addition to the regular fraud. Various examples 
show how the extensive interpretation of existing provisions cannot substitute for the adoption of new 
laws.  
Apart from adjustment for well-known scams, law-makers must continuously analyse new and developing 
types of cybercrime to ensure their effective criminalization. One example of a cybercrime that has not 
yet been criminalized in all countries is theft and fraud in computer and online games.850 For a long time, 
discussions about online games focused on youth protection issues (e.g. the requirement for verification 
of  age)  and  illegal  content  (e.g. access  to  child  pornography  in  the  online  game  “Second  Life”).851 New 
criminal activities are constantly being discovered. Virtual currencies in online games may be “stolen” and 
traded in auction platforms.852 Some virtual currencies have a value in terms of real currency (based on an 
exchange  rate),  giving  the  crime  a  ‘real’  dimension.853 Such  offences  may  not  be  prosecutable  in  all 
countries. In order to prevent safe havens for offenders, it is vital to monitor developments worldwide. 

instruments  to 

Increasing use of ICTs and the need for new investigative instruments 

3.3.3 
Offenders  use  ICTs  in  various  ways  in  the  preparation  and  execution  of  their  offences. 854 Law-
enforcement  agencies  need  adequate 
investigate  potential  criminal  acts.  Some 
instruments (such as data retention855) could interfere with the rights of innocent Internet users.856 If the 
severity  of  the  criminal  offence  is  out  of  proportion  with  the  intensity  of  interference,  the  use  of 
investigative  instruments  could  be  unjustified  or  unlawful.  As  a  result,  some  instruments  that  could 
improve investigation have not yet been introduced in a number of countries.  
The introduction of investigative instruments is always the result of a trade-off between the advantages 
for law-enforcement agencies and interference with the rights of innocent Internet users. It is essential to 
monitor ongoing criminal activities to evaluate whether threat levels change. Often, the introduction of 
new instruments has been justified on the basis of the “fight against terrorism”, but this is more of an far-
reaching motivation, rather than a specific justification per se.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Developing procedures for digital evidence 

 
3.3.4 
Especially  due  the  low  costs857 compared  to  the  storage  of  physical  documents,  the  number  of  digital 
documents is increasing.858 Digitization and the emerging use of ICTs  has a great impact on procedures 
related to the collection of evidence and its use in court.859 As a consequence of this development, digital 
evidence  has  been  introduced  as  a  new  source  of  evidence.860 It  is  defined  as  any  data  stored  or 
transmitted using computer technology that supports the theory of how an offence occurred.861 Handling 
digital  evidence  is  accompanied  with  unique  challenges  and  requires  specific  procedures.862 One  of  the 
most difficult aspects is to maintain the integrity of the digital evidence.863 Digital data are highly fragile 
and can easily be deleted864 or modified. This is especially relevant for information stored in the system 
memory  RAM  that  is  automatically  deleted  when  the  system  is  shut  down865 and  therefore  requires 
special preservation techniques.866 In addition, new developments can have great impact on dealing with 
digital  evidence.  An  example  is  cloud  computing.  In  the  past,  investigators  were  able  to  focus  on  the 
suspects’ premises when searching for computer data. Today, they need to take into consideration that 
digital information might be stored abroad and can only be accessed remotely, if necessary.867 
Digital  evidence  plays  an  important  role  in  various  phases  of  cybercrime  investigations.  It  is  in  general 
possible  to  separate  four  phases.868 The  first  phase  is  identification  of  the  relevant  evidence.869 It  is 
followed  by  collection  and  preservation  of  the  evidence.870 The  third  phase  includes  the  analysis  of 
computer technology and digital evidence. Finally, the evidence needs to be presented in court. 
In  addition  to  the  procedures  that  relate  to  the  presentation  of  digital  evidence  in  court,  the  ways  in 
which digital evidence is collected requires special attention. The collection of digital evidence is linked to 
computer forensics. The term ‘computer forensics’ describes the systematic analysis of IT equipment for 
the purpose of searching for digital evidence.871 The fact that the amount of data stored in digital format is 
constantly increasing, highlights the logistic challenges of such investigations.872 Approaches to automated 
forensic procedures using, for example, hash-value based searches for known child-pornography images873 
or a keyword search874 therefore play an important role in addition to manual investigations.875  
Depending on the requirement of the specific investigation, computer forensics could for example include 
analysing the hardware and software used by a suspect876, supporting investigators in identifying relevant 
evidence,877 recovering deleted files,878 decrypting files879 and identifying Internet users by analysing traffic 
data.880

692  A demonstration of the impact of even short interruptions to Internet and computer services was the harm caused by 

the computer worm “Sasser”. In 2004, the worm affected computers running versions of Microsoft’s Windows 
operating system. As a result of the worm, a number of services were interrupted. Among them were the US airline 
“Delta Airlines” that had to cancel several trans-Atlantic flights because its computer systems had been swamped by the 
worm, whilst the electronic mapping services of the British Coastguard were disabled for a few hours. See Heise News,

706  An example for new technology in this area is WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), a standards-
based wireless technology that provides broadband connections over long distances. Each WiMAX node could enable 
high-speed Internet connectivity in a radius of up to 50 km. For more information, see: The WiMAX Forum at

708  The fact that the offenders are not only based in western countries is proven by current analysis that suggests for 
example that an increasing number of phishing websites are hosted in developing countries. For more details, see:

752  See below: § 6.6.12. 
753  See below: § 6.6. 
754  One example is phishing. Although most sites are still stored in the United States (32%), which has strong legislation in 

place, countries such as China (13%), Russia (7%) and the Republic of Korea (6%), which may have less effective 
instruments in the field of international cooperation in place, are playing a more important role. Apart from the United 
States, none of them has yet signed and ratified cybercrime specific international agreements that would enable and 
oblige them to effectively participate in international investigations.  

755  This issue was addressed by a number of international organizations. UN General Assembly Resolution 55/63 points 

out: “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse 
information technologies”. The full text of the resolution is available at: 
www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/a_res_55/res5563e.pdf. The G8 10 Point Action plan highlights: “There must be no safe

819  Regarding the consequences for the law enforcement, Denning observed: “The widespread availability of unbreakable 

encryption coupled with anonymous services could lead to a situation where practically all communications are immune 
from lawful interception and documents from lawful search and seizure, and where all electronic transactions are 
beyond the reach of any government regulation or oversight. The consequences of this to public safety and social and 
economic stability could be devastating”. Excerpt from a presentation given by Denning, “The Future of Cryptography”, 
to the joint Australian/OECD conference on Security, February, 1996. Regarding practical approaches to recover

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
836  Phil Zimmermann, the developer of the encryption software PGP, developed a plug-in for VoIP software that can be 

used to install added encryption, in addition to the encryption provided by the operator of the communication services. 
The difficulty arising from the use of additional encryption methods is the fact that, even if the law-enforcement 
agencies intercept the communications between two suspects, the additional encryption will hinder the analysis. For 
more information on the software, see: Markoff, “Voice Encryption may draw US Scrutiny”, New York Times, 
22.05.2006, available at:

The  growing  number  of  recognized  cybercrimes  and  technical  tools  to  automate  cybercrime  offences 
(including  anonymous  file-sharing  systems881 and  software  products  designed  to  develop  computer 
viruses882) mean that the fight against cybercrime has become an essential element of law-enforcement 
activities  worldwide.  Cybercrime  is  a  challenge  to  law-enforcement  agencies  in  both  developed  and 
developing  countries.  Since  ICTs  evolve  so  rapidly,  especially  in  developing  countries,  the  creation  and 
implementation  of  an  effective  anti-cybercrime  strategy  as  part  of  a  national  cybersecurity  strategy  is 
essential.

Cybercrime legislation as an integral part of a cybersecurity strategy 

4.1 
As  pointed  out  previously,  cybersecurity883 plays  an  important  role  in  the  ongoing  development  of 
information technology, as well as Internet services.884 Making the Internet safer (and protecting Internet 
users)  has  become  integral  to  the  development  of  new  services  as  well  as  governmental  policy.885 
Cybersecurity strategies – for example, the development of technical protection systems or the education 
of  users  to  prevent  them  from  becoming  victims  of  cybercrime  –  can  help  to  reduce  the  risk  of 
cybercrime.886  
An  anti-cybercrime  strategy  should  be  an  integral  element  of  a  cybersecurity  strategy.  The  ITU  Global 
Cybersecurity Agenda,887 as a global framework for dialogue and international cooperation to coordinate 
the  international  response  to  the  growing  challenges  to  cybersecurity  and  to  enhance  confidence  and 
security in the information society, builds on existing work, initiatives and partnerships with the objective 
of proposing global strategies to address these related challenges. All the required measures highlighted 
in the five pillars of Global Cybersecurity Agenda are relevant to any cybersecurity strategy. Furthermore, 
the ability to effectively fight against cybercrime requires measures to be undertaken within all of the five 
pillars.888  

 

97 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Implementation of existing strategies 

 
4.1.1 
One possibility is that anti-cybercrime strategies developed in industrialized countries could be introduced 
in  developing  countries,  offering  advantages  of  reduced  cost  and  time  for  development.  The 
implementation of existing strategies could enable developing countries to benefit from existing insights 
and experience.  
Nevertheless, the implementation of an existing anti-cybercrime strategy poses a number of difficulties. 
Although similar challenges confront both developing and developed countries, the optimal solutions that 
might be adopted depend on the resources and capabilities of each country. Industrialized countries may 
be  able  to  promote  cybersecurity  in  different  and  more  flexible  ways,  e.g. by  focusing  on  more  cost-
intensive technical protection issues. 
There  are  several  other  issues  that  need  to  be  taken  into  account  by  developing  countries  adopting 
existing anti-cybercrime strategies. They include compatibility of respective legal systems, the status of 
supporting  initiatives  (e.g. education  of  the  society),  the  extent  of  self-protection  measures  in  place  as 
well as the extent of private sector support (e.g. through public-private partnerships). 

Regional differences 

4.1.2 
Given the international nature of cybercrime, the harmonization of national laws and techniques is vital in 
the  fight  against  cybercrime.  However,  harmonization  must  take  into  account  regional  demand  and 
capacity.  The  importance  of  regional  aspects  in  the  implementation  of  anti-cybercrime  strategies  is 
underlined  by  the  fact  that  many  legal  and  technical  standards  were  agreed  among  industrialized 
countries and do not include various aspects important for developing countries.889 Therefore, regional 
factors and differences need to be included within their implementation elsewhere.  

Relevance of cybercrime issues within the pillars of cybersecurity 

4.1.3 
The  Global  Cybersecurity  Agenda  has  seven  main  strategic  goals,  built  on  five  work  areas:  1) Legal 
measures;  2) Technical  and  procedural  measures;  3) Organizational  structures;  4) Capacity  building; 
and 5) International cooperation. As pointed out above, issues related to cybercrime play an important 
role in all five pillars of the Global Cybersecurity Agenda. Among these work areas, the “Legal measures” 
work areas focuses on how to address the legislative challenges posed by criminal activities committed 
over ICT networks in an internationally compatible manner. 

A cybercrime policy as starting point 

4.2 
Developing  legislation  to  criminalize  certain  conduct  or  introduce  investigation  instruments  is  a  rather 
unusual process for most countries. The regular procedure is first of all to introduce a policy.890 A policy is 
comparable to a strategy that defines the different instruments used to address the issue. Unlike a more 
general  cybercrime  strategy  that  may  address  various  stakeholders,  the  role  of  policy  is  to  define  the 
government’s public response to a certain issue.891 This response is not necessarily limited to legislation as 
governments have various instruments that can be used to achieve policy goals. And even if the decision 
is made that there is a need to implement legislation, it does not necessarily need to focus on criminal law 
but could also include legislation more focussed on crime prevention. In this regard, developing a policy 
enables  a  government  to  comprehensively  define  the  government  response  to  a  problem.  As  the  fight 
against cybercrime can never solely be limited to introducing legislation, but contains various strategies 
with different measures, the policy can ensure that those different measures don’t cause conflicts.  
Within different approaches to harmonize cybercrime legislation too little priority has been given to not 
only integrating the legislation in the national legal framework but also including it into an existing policy, 
or  developing  such  policy  for  the  first  time.  As  a  consequence  some  countries  that  merely  introduced 
cybercrime  legislation  without  having  developed  an  anti-cybercrime  strategy  as  well  as  policies  on  the 
government  level  faced  severe  difficulties.  They  were  mainly  a  result  of  a  lack  of  crime  prevention 
measures as well as an overlapping between different measures.  

98 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Responsibility within the government 

 
4.2.1 
The  policy  enables  the  adjustment  of  competences  for  a  topic  within  the  government.  Overlapping 
between different ministries is nothing unusual – with regard to cybercrime it is happening frequently as 
it is an interdisciplinary subject.892 Aspects related to the fight against cybercrime may be related to the 
mandate of the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Communication or Ministry of National Security to name 
only three. Within the process of developing a policy, the role of the different government institutions 
involved can be defined.  
This is, for example, expressed in the ICB4PAC893 Draft Model Policy for Cybercrime: 
It is in this regard crucial that the responsibilities of the different stakeholders are clearly defined. This is 
particularly relevant because Cybercrime is a cross-sector topic that might relate to mandates of different 
institutions such as Attorney General, Ministry of Communication and other. 

Defining the different components 

4.2.2 
As  indicated above  the policy  can  be  used  to  define different  components  of  the  approach.  This  could 
range from strengthening institutional capacities (e.g. police and prosecution) to concrete amendments of 
legislation (such as the introduction of more advanced legislation).  
This is another issue expressed in the ICB4PAC894 Draft Model Policy for Cybercrime: 

Addressing the multi-dimensional challenges of fighting Cybercrime requires a comprehensive approach 
that  should  include  overall  policies,  legislation,  education  and  awareness  raising,  capacity  building, 
research as well as technical approaches.  

Ideally the policy should be used to coordinate the various activities – even if they are implemented by 
different ministries and government bodies. The fact that policies in general require approval by cabinet 
therefore not only enables the identification of different government bodies and ministries involved with 
regard to the topic, but also enables the harmonization of their activities.895  

Determination of stakeholders 

4.2.3 
The  policy  can  not  only  identify  the  government  institutions  involved  but  also  the  stakeholders  that 
should  be  addressed.  It  may,  for  example,  be  necessary  to  develop  guidelines  with  regard  to  the 
involvement of the private sector.  
The  issue  of  stakeholders  that  should  be  involved  and  addressed  is,  for  example,  expressed  in  the 
ICB4PAC896 Draft Model Policy for Cybercrime: 
Further  more  such  approach  needs  to  involve  various  stakeholders  such  as  government,  ministries  and 
government  agencies,  private  sector,  schools  and  universities,  customary 
leaders,  community, 
international  and  regional  bodies,  law  enforcement,  judges,  customs,  prosecutors,  lawyers,  civil  society 
and NGOs. 

Identification of benchmarks 

4.2.4 
As underlined further below the importance of harmonization of legislation is identified as a key priority 
by  different  regional  organizations.897 But  the  need  for  harmonization  is  not  limited  to  legislation  –  it 
includes issues like strategy and training of experts.898 The policy can be used to identify the areas where 
harmonization  should  take  place  as  well  as  to  define  the  regional  and/or  international  standards  that 
should be implemented.  
The  importance  of  harmonization  is  for  example  expressed  in  the  ICB4PAC899 Draft  Model  Policy  for 
Cybercrime. 

 

99 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
With regard to the global dimension of Cybercrime as well as the need to protect the Internet users in the 
region  from  becoming  victims  of  Cybercrime,  measures  to  increase  the  ability  to  combat  Cybercrime 
should have high priority. Strategies and especially legislation that is developed to address the challenges 
of Cybercrime should on the one hand side be in line with international standards and on the other hand 
side reflect the uniqueness of the region. 

Another example is the HIPCAR Model Policy on Cybercrime900. 
There  shall  be  provisions  covering  the  most  common  and  internationally  widely  accepted  forms  of 
Cybercrime  as  well  as  those  offences  that  are  of  specific  interest  for  the  region  (such  as  for  example 
SPAM).  
To ensure the ability to cooperate with law enforcement agencies from countries in the region as well as 
outside the region the legislation shall be compatible to both international standards and best practices as 
well as (up to the largest extent possible) to existing regional standards and best practices.  

Defining key topics for legislation 

4.2.5 
The policy can be used to define key areas that should be addressed by legislation. This could include a list 
of offences that should be covered, for example. The level of detail could go down to details of provisions 
that should be included in a cybercrime law. 
One example is the HIPCAR Model Policy on Cybercrime901. 

There  should  be  a  provision  criminalizing  the  intentional  and  illegal  production,  sale  and  related  acts 
related  to  child  pornography.  Especially  in  this  respect  international  standards  should  be  taken  into 
consideration.  The  legislation  should  in  addition  cover  the  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  child 
pornography  and  gaining  access  to  child  pornography  websites.  An  exemption  that  enables  law 
enforcement agencies to carry out investigations should be included.  

Defining legal frameworks that require amendments, updates or changes 

4.2.6 
Introducing cybercrime legislation is not an easy task as there are various areas that require regulation. In 
addition to substantive criminal law and procedural law, cybercrime legislation may include issues related 
to international cooperation, electronic evidence and the liability of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). In 
most  countries  elements  of  such  legislation  may  already  exist  –  often  in  different  legal  frameworks. 
Provisions  related  to  cybercrime  do  not  necessarily  need  to  be  implemented  in  one  single  piece  of 
legislation.  With  regard  to  existing  structures,  it  might  be  necessary  to  update  different  pieces  of 
legislation  (such  as  amending  an  Evidence  Act  to  ensure  that  it  is  applicable  with  regard  to  the 
admissibility of electronic evidence in criminal proceedings) or remove provision from an older law (for 
example in a Telecommunications Act) within the process of introducing new legislation.  
This  approach  of  implementing  cybercrime  legislation  by  a  process  of  respecting  existing  structures  is 
certainly  more  challenging than  simply  implementing a  regional  standard  or  international  best  practice 
word  by  word  in  a  standalone  piece  of  legislation.  But  with  regard  to  the  fact  that  this  process  of 
customizing allows national legal traditions to be kept, many countries favour such an approach.  
The policy can be used to define the different components that should be integrated as well as identify 
existing laws that require updates.  

Relevance of crime prevention 

4.2.7 
Despite the fact that threats of punishment potentially prevent crimes, the focus of criminal legislation is 
not  on  crime  prevention  but  on  sanctioning  crime.  However,  crime  prevention  is  identified  as  a  key 
component in an effective fight against cybercrime.902 Measures can range from technical solutions (such 
as firewalls that prevent illegal access to a computer system and anti-virus software that can hinder the 
installation of malicious software) to the blocking of access to illegal content.903  

100 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The  importance  of  crime  prevention  is  for  example  expressed  in  the  ICB4PAC904 Draft  Model  Policy  for 
Cybercrime: 

In addition to the criminalisation of Cybercrime and the improvement of the ability of law enforcement to 
combat Cybercrime crime preventions measures need to be developed. Within the process of developing 
such measures, that can range from technical solutions to increasing user awareness, it is important to 
identify those groups that require specific attention such as youth, technologically challenged people (such 
as people from isolated villages that are technologically unaware) and women. However, crime prevention 
measures  should  also  apply  to  more  advanced  users  and  technology-affiliate  players  such  as  critical 
infrastructure  provider  (such  as  the  tourism  or  financial  sector).  The  debate  about  necessary  measures 
should include the whole range of instruments such as awareness raising, making available and promoting 
free  of  charge  protection  technology  (such  as  anti-virus  software)  and  the  implementation  of  solutions 
that enable parents to restrict the access to certain content. Such measures should ideally be available at 
the time of an introduction of a service/technology and maintained through out it’s operation. To ensure a 
wider reach of such measure a broad range of stakeholders should be involved that range from Internet 
Service Provider to governments and regional bodies and explore various sources for funding.  

The role of regulators in fighting cybercrime 

4.3 
In decades gone by, the focus of solutions discussed to address cybercrime was on legislation. As already 
pointed out in the chapter dealing with an anti-cybercrime strategy, however, the necessary components 
of a comprehensive approach to address cybercrime are more complex. Recently, the spotlight has fallen 
on the role of regulators in the fight of cybercrime.  

From telecommunication regulation to ICT regulation  

4.3.1 
The  role  of  regulators  in  the  context  of  telecommunications  is  widely  recognized.905 As  Internet  has 
eroded  the  old  models  of  the  division  of  responsibilities  between  government  and  private  sector,  a 
transformation of the traditional role of ICT regulators and a change in the focus of ICT regulation can be 
observed.906 Already  today  ICT  regulatory  authorities  find  themselves  involved  in  a  range  of  activities 
linked  to  addressing  cybercrime.  This  is  especially  relevant  for  areas  like  content  regulation,  network 
safety  and  consumer  protection,  as  users  have  become  vulnerable.907 The  involvement  of  regulators  is 
therefore  the  result  of  the  fact  that  cybercrime  undermines  the  development  of  the  ICT  industry  and 
related products and services.  
The new duties and responsibilities of the ICT regulator in combating cybercrime can be seen as part of 
the  wider  trend  towards  the  conversion  of  centralized  models  of  cybercrime  regulation  into  flexible 
structures.  In  some  countries,  ICT  regulators  have  already  explored  the  possibility  of  transferring  the 
scope  of  regulatory  duties  from  competition  and  authorization  issues  within  the  telecom  industry  to 
broader  consumer  protection,  industry  development,  cybersafety,  participation  in  cybercrime  policy-
making  and  implementation,  which  includes  the  wider  use  of  ICTs  and  as  a  consequence  cybercrime-
related 
issues.  While  some  new  regulatory  authorities  have  been  created  with  mandates  and 
responsibilities  that  include  cybercrime,908 older  established  ICT  regulators  have  extended  their  existing 
tasks  to  include  various  activities  aimed  at  tackling  cyber-related  threats.909 However,  the  extent  and 
limitations of such involvement are still under discussion. 

4.3.2  Models for extension of regulator responsibility  
There  are  two  different  models  for  establishing  the  mandate  of  regulators  in  combating  cybercrime, 
namely: extensively interpreting the existing mandate, or creating new mandates.  
Two traditional areas of involvement of regulators are consumer protection and network safety. With the 
shift from telecommunication services to Internet-related services, the focus of consumer protection has 
changed. In addition to the traditional threats, the impact of Spam, malicious software and botnets need 
to be taken into consideration. One example of extending a mandate comes from the Dutch Independent 
Post  and  Telecommunication  Authority  (OPTA).  The  mandate 910  of  the  regulator  includes  Spam 

 

101 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
prohibition911 and  preventing  the  dissemination  of  malware.912 During  the  debate  on  the  mandate  of 
OPTA,  the  organization  expressed  the  view  that  a  bridge  should  be  built  between  cybersecurity  as  a 
traditional field of activity and cybercrime in order to effectively address both issues.913 If cybercrime is 
seen as a failure of cybersecurity, the mandate of regulators is consequently automatically expanded.  
The  possibility  of  extending  the  regulator’s  mandate  to  include  cybercrime  issues  also  depends  on  the 
institutional design of the regulator, and whether it is a multisector regulator (like utility commissions), a 
sector-specific telecom regulator or a converged regulator. While every model of institutional design has 
its  advantages  and  disadvantages  from  the  perspective  of  ICT  industry  regulation914,  the  type  of 
institutional design should be taken into account when assessing how and in what areas the ICT regulator 
should  be  involved.  Converged  regulators,  with  responsibility  for  media  and  content  as  well  as  ICT 
services, generally face a challenge in terms of complexity of workloads. However, their comprehensive 
mandate can constitute an advantage in dealing with content-related issues, such as child pornography or 
other  illegal  or  harmful  content.915 In  a  converged  environment  where  traditional  telecommunication 
regulators  may  struggle  to  resolve  certain  issues,  such  as  consolidation  between  media  content  and 
telecommunication  service  providers,  the  converged  regulator  appears  to  be  in  a  better  position  to 
address  content-network  issues.  Furthermore,  the  converged  regulator  can  help  to  avoid  inconsistency 
and  uncertainty  of  regulation  and  unequal  regulatory  intervention  in  respect  of  the  different  content 
delivered  over  various  platforms.916 Nevertheless,  the  discussion  of  the  advantages  of  a  converged 
regulator  should  not  undermine  the  importance  of  the  activities  of  single-sector  regulators.  While,  for 
instance, up to the end of 2009 the European Union had only four converged ICT regulators,917 many more 
were involved in addressing cybercrime. 
When  thinking  of  extending  the  interpretation  of  existing  mandates,  account  must  be  taken  of  the 
capacity of the regulator and the need to avoid overlap with the mandates of other organizations. Such 
potential conflicts can be solved more easily if new mandates are clearly defined. 
The  second  approach  is  the  creation  of new  mandates.  In  view  of the  potential for  conflicts,  countries 
such  as  Malaysia  have  decided  to  redefine  mandates  to  avoid  confusion  and  overlap.  The  Malaysian 
Communications  and  Multimedia  Commission  (MCMC),  as  a  converged  regulator,  has  established  a 
special  department 918  dealing  with  information  security  and  network  reliability,  the  integrity  of 
communications  and  critical  communication  infrastructure.919 A  similar  approach  can  be  observed  in 
South Korea, where in 2008 the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) was created by consolidating 
the former Ministry of Information and Communication and the Korean Broadcasting Commission. Among 
other duties, KCC is responsible for the protection of Internet users from harmful or illegal content.920 

Examples for involvement of regulators in fighting cybercrime 

4.3.3 
It is not only the model for defining the regulators’ mandate, but also the scope of action of ICT regulators 
in this field that is not yet clearly defined. Only few ICT regulatory bodies have effective powers to go 
beyond  telecommunication  regulation  and  deal  with  wider  ICT  sector  issues.  Operating  in  a  rapidly 
changing  and  developing  sector  exposes  ICT  regulators  to  new  areas  that  have  traditionally  been 
considered as the domain of other government departments and agencies, or even no-one’s domain at 
all.921 Even if the regulator possesses de facto sufficient competence and industry expertise to be involved 
in  addressing  specific  cybercrime-related  issues,  a  clear  mandate  pinpointing  the  exact  areas  of 
involvement is key for regulators to be effective. The potential areas of involvement for regulators are 
highlighted below: 

Global policy strategies 
The  principle  of  the  division  of  power  within  the  state 922  separates  policy-making  and  policy 
implementation.923 Despite  the  importance  of  this  concept,  the  complexity  of  the  issue  may  require 
regulators  to  be  involved  in  policy  advice.924 On  account  of  their  industry  expertise  and  existing 
communication channels with other stakeholders, ICT regulators in many countries play an important role 
in  determining  policies  and  strategies  for  ICT  industry  development.925 In  some  countries,  the  role  of 
providing  inputs  to  ICT  policy-making  is  therefore  considered  as  one  of  the  main  tasks  of  the  ICT 

102 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
regulator.926 While  this  common  practice  focuses  on  advice  on  telecommunication  issues,  the  mandate 
could  be  extended  to  cybercrime.  In  Finland,  the  government  has  set  up  an  Advisory  Committee  for 
Information  Security  (ACIS)  under  the  Finnish  Communications  Regulatory  Authority  (FICORA)  for  the 
purpose  of  developing  their  national  information  strategy. 927 The  proposal  released  by  ACIS  in  2002 
identifies  goals  and  measures  to  promote  the  information-security  strategy.  Several  measures  can  be 
considered as cybercrime-related, and highlight the importance of developing and improving appropriate 
legislation, international cooperation, and increasing information-security awareness among end-users.928  

Involvement in the development of cybercrime legislation 
The competent body to adopt legislation is the legislator, not a regulatory authority. However, the ICT 
regulator can play an important role in the process of developing cybercrime legislation. In view of the 
experience regulators possess in data protection, the confidentiality of data transmission, prevention of 
the spreading of malicious software, other aspects of consumer protection and ISP responsibilities, their 
involvement is especially discussed in those fields.929 In addition, criminal law is not an unknown field for 
regulators,  since  in  many  countries  grave  violations  of  obligations  in  the  traditional  area  of  regulatory 
work may be subject to criminal sanctions. In addition to having an advisory role with regard to overall 
strategies  as  highlighted  above,  regulators  can  be  involved  in  the  process  of  drafting  legislation.  The 
Ugandan Communications Commission, for example, was involved as adviser in the process of drafting 
cybercrime  legislation.930 Moreover,  the  Ugandan  Communications  Commission,  through  the  Ugandan 
National Task Force on cybercrime legislation, is now part of a regional initiative, called the East African 
Countries’  Task  Force  on  Cyber  Laws,  which  is  dedicated  to  an  ongoing  process  of  development  and 
harmonization  of  cybercrime  laws  in  the  East  African  region. 931 In  Zambia,  the  Communications 
Authority932 was  reported  to  have  assisted  in  drafting  new  cybercrime-related  legislation,933 namely  the 
Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 2009.934 A further example is Belgium, where in 2006 the 
Belgian  ICT  regulator  (BIPT)  assisted  in  the  process  of  drafting  cybercrime  legislation.  The  draft  was 
developed  in  cooperation  with  the  Federal  Public  Service  of  Justice  and  the  Federal  Computer  Crime 
Unit.935  

Detecting and investigating cybercrime 
Computer incident response teams (CIRTs) play an important role in monitoring, detecting, analysing and 
investigating  cyberthreats  and  cyberincidents. 936 Due  to  the  multisector  nature  of  the  cybercrime 
problem,  different  CIRTs  have  been  established  by  a  range  of  stakeholders,  including  governments, 
businesses,  telecom  operators  and  academia,  to  fulfil  various  functions.937 In  some  countries,  ICT 
regulators are responsible for creating and running national CIRTs. These CIRTs are usually considered not 
only as major entities in charge of detecting and investigating cybercrime incidents at the national level, 
but also as key participants in actions to enhance cybercrime cooperation at the international level. One 
of  the  first  CIRTs  established  as  an  initiative  under  the  ICT  regulator  is  the  Finnish  national  Computer 
Emergency  Response  Team,  launched  in  January  2002  within  the  Finnish  Communications  Regulatory 
Authority (FICORA).938 Other examples may be found in Sweden,939 United Arab Emirates940 and Qatar.941 

Facilitation of law enforcement 
An ICT regulator can only undertake investigations and in this respect act as law enforcement on the basis 
of an explicit mandate granted to the regulator to exercise and enforce particular legal provisions. Some 
countries have authorized ICT regulators to act as a law-enforcement agency in cybercrime-related areas 
such as anti-spam, content regulation or enforcing co-regulatory measures. With regard to Spam, some 
European  ICT  regulators  are  already  part  of  a  contact  network  of  anti-spam  enforcement  authorities 
established by the European Commission in 2004 to fight spam on a pan-European level.942 The OECD Task 
Force  on  Spam  also  lists  ICT  regulators  as  contact  points  for  enforcement  agencies.943 Cooperation 
agreements between ICT regulators and cybercrime units at the police level are also known to exist in the 
Netherlands and Romania.944  

 

103 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Legal measures 

 
4.3.4 
Of the five pillars of the Global Cybersecurity Agenda, legal measures are probably the most relevant with 
regard to an anti-cybercrime strategy.  

Substantive criminal law 
This  requires  first  of  all  the  necessary  substantive  criminal-law  provisions  to  criminalize  acts  such  as 
computer fraud, illegal access, data interference, copyright violations and child pornography.945 The fact 
that  provisions  exist  in  the  criminal  code  that  are  applicable  to  similar  acts  committed  outside  the 
network  does  not  mean  that  they  can  be  applied  to  acts  committed  over  the  Internet  as  well.946 
Therefore, a thorough analysis of current national laws is vital to identify any possible gaps.947  

Criminal procedural law 
Apart  from  substantive  criminal-law  provisions,948 law-enforcement  agencies  need  the  necessary  tools 
and  instruments  to  investigate  cybercrime.949 Such  investigations  themselves  present  a  number  of 
challenges.950 Perpetrators can act from nearly any location in the world and take measures to mask their 
identity.951 The tools and instruments needed to investigate cybercrime can be quite different from those 
used to investigate ordinary crimes.952 Due to the international dimension953 of cybercrime it is in addition 
necessary  to  develop  the  legal  national  framework  to  be  able  to  cooperate  with  law-enforcement 
agencies abroad.954  

Electronic evidence 
When dealing with cybercrime the competent investigation authorities, as well as courts, need to deal 
with electronic evidence. Dealing with such evidence presents a number of challenges955 but also opens 
up  new  possibilities  for  investigation  and  for  the  work  of  forensic  experts  and  courts.956 In  those  cases 
where  no  other  sources  of  evidence  are  available,  the  ability  to  successfully  identify  and  prosecute  an 
offender may depend upon the correct collection and evaluation of electronic evidence.957 This influences 
the  way  law-enforcement  agencies  and  courts  deal  with  such  evidence.958 While  traditional  documents 
are  introduced  by  handing  out  the  original  document  in  court,  digital  evidence  in  some  cases  requires 
specific procedures that do not allow conversion into traditional evidence, e.g. by presenting a printout of 
files and other discovered data.959 Having legislation in place that deals with the admissibility of evidence 
is therefore seen as vital in the fight against cybercrime.  

International cooperation 
Due to the transnational dimension of the Internet and the globalization of services, an increasing number 
of  cybercrimes  have  an  international  dimension.960 Countries  that  desire  to  cooperate  with  other 
countries in investigating cross-border crime will need to use instruments of international cooperation.961 
Taking into account the mobility of offenders, the independence from presence of the offender and the 
impact  of  the  offence  shows  the  challenge  and  the  need  for  a  collaboration  of  law-enforcement  and 
judicial  authorities. 962  Due  to  differences 
international 
cooperation  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  major  challenges  of  a  globalization  of  crime.963 Within  a 
comprehensive approach to address cybercrime, countries need to consider strengthening their ability to 
cooperate with other countries and making the procedure more efficient.  

instruments, 

limited 

in  national 

law  and 

Liability of service provider 
Cybercrime can hardly be committed without the use of the services of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
E-Mails with threatening content are sent by using the service of an e-mail provider and illegal content 
downloaded from a website involves among others the service of a Hosting Provider and Access Provider. 
As a consequence, ISPs are often in the centre of criminal investigations involving offenders who use the 
ISPs’ services to commit an offence.964 Taking into account that on the one hand, cybercrime cannot be 
committed without the involvement of ISPs but on the other hand, providers often do not have the ability 

104 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
to prevent these crimes, led to the question of whether the responsibility of Internet providers needs to 
be limited.965 This issue may be addressed within a comprehensive legal approach to cybercrime. 

Technical and procedural measures 

4.3.5 
Cybercrime-related  investigations  very  often  have  a  strong  technical  component.966 In  addition,  the 
requirement to maintain the integrity of the evidence during an investigation calls for precise procedures. 
The development of the necessary capacities as well as procedures is therefore a necessary requirement 
in the fight against cybercrime.  
Another issue is the development of technical protection systems. Well-protected computer systems are 
more difficult to attack. Improving technical protection by implementing proper security standards is an 
important first step. For example, changes in the online banking system (e.g. the switch from TAN967 to 
ITAN968) have eliminated much of the danger posed by current “phishing” attacks, demonstrating the vital 
importance  of  technical  solutions.969 Technical  protection  measures  should  include  all  elements  of  the 
technical  infrastructure  –  the  core  network  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  many  individually  connected 
computers  worldwide.  Two  potential  target  groups  can  be  identified  for  protecting  Internet  users  and 
businesses: end users and businesses (direct approach) and service providers and software companies. 
Logistically, it can be easier to focus on protection of core infrastructure (e.g. backbone network, routers, 
essential  services),  rather  than  integrating  millions  of  users  into  an  anti-cybercrime  strategy.  User 
protection  can  be  achieved  indirectly,  by  securing  the  services  consumers  use,  such  as  online  banking. 
This indirect approach to protecting Internet users can reduce the number of people and institutions that 
need to be included in steps to promote technical protection.  
Although  limiting  the  number  of  people  that  need  to  be  included  in  technical  protection  might  seem 
desirable, computer and Internet users are often the weakest link and the main target of criminals. It is 
often easier to attack private computers to obtain sensitive information, rather than the well-protected 
computer  systems  of  a  financial  institution.  Despite  the  logistical  problems,  the  protection  of  end-user 
infrastructure is vital for the technical protection of the whole network.  
Internet service providers and product vendors (e.g. software companies) play a vital role in the support 
of anti-cybercrime strategies. Due to their direct contact with clients, they can operate as a guarantor of 
security activities (e.g. the distribution of protection tools and information on the current status of most 
recent scams).970  

Organizational structures 
An effective fight against cybercrime requires highly developed organizational structures. Without having 
the  right  structures  in  place,  ones  that  avoid  overlapping  and  are  based  on  clear  competences,  it  will 
hardly be possible to carry out complex investigations that require the assistance of different legal as well 
as technical experts.  

Capacity building and user education 
Cybercrime is a global phenomenon. In order to be able to investigate offences effectively, laws need to 
be harmonized and means of international cooperation need to be developed. In order to ensure global 
standards in both the developed and the developing countries, capacity building is necessary.971  
In  addition  to  capacity  building,  user  education  is  required.972 Certain  cybercrimes  –  especially  those 
related  to  fraud,  such  as  “phishing”  and  “spoofing”  –  do  not  generally  depend  on  a  lack  of  technical 
protection,  but  rather  on a  lack  of awareness  on  the  part  of  the  victims.973 There  are  various  software 
products  that  can  automatically  identify  fraudulent  websites,974 but  until  now  these  products  cannot 
identify all suspicious websites. A user-protection strategy based only on software products has limited 
ability  to  protect  users.975 Although  technical  protection  measures  continue  to  develop  and  available 
products are updated on a regular basis, such products cannot yet substitute for other approaches.  

 

105 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
One of the most important elements in the prevention of cybercrime is user education.976 For example, if 
users are aware that their financial institutions will never contact them by e-mail requesting passwords or 
bank-account  details,  they  cannot  fall  victim  to  phishing  or  identity-fraud  attacks.  The  education  of 
Internet users reduces the number of potential targets. Users can be educated through public campaigns, 
lessons in schools, libraries, IT centres and universities as well as public private partnerships (PPPs).  
One important requirement of an efficient education and information strategy is open communication of 
the  latest  cybercrime  threats.  Some  states  and/or  private  businesses  refuse  to  emphasize  that  citizens 
and clients respectively are affected by cybercrime threats, in order to avoid them losing trust in online 
communication services. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation has explicitly asked companies 
to overcome their aversion to negative publicity and report cybercrime.977 In order to determine threat 
levels,  as  well  as  to  inform  users,  it  is  vital  to  improve  the  collection  and  publication  of  relevant 
information.978  

International cooperation  
In many cases, data-transfer processes in the Internet affect more than one country.979 This is a result of 
the design of the network, and the fact that the protocols ensure that successful transmissions can be 
made, even if direct lines are temporarily blocked.980 In addition, a large number of Internet services (like 
for example hosting services) are offered by companies that are based abroad.981  
In  those  cases  where  the  offender  is  not  based  in  the  same  country  at  the  victim,  the  investigation 
requires cooperation between law-enforcement agencies in all the countries affected.982 International and 
transnational investigations without the consent of the competent authorities in the countries involved 
are difficult in regard to the principle of national sovereignty. This principle does not in general allow one 
country to carry out investigations within the territory of another country without the permission of the 
local authorities.983 Therefore, investigations need to be carried out with the support of the authorities in 
all the countries involved. With regard to the fact that in most cases there is only a very short time gap 
available  in  which  successful  investigations  can  take  place,  application  of  the  classic  mutual  legal 
assistance regimes involves clear difficulties when it comes to cybercrime investigations. This is due to the 
fact  that  mutual  legal  assistance  in  general  requires  time-consuming  formal  procedures.  As  a  result, 
improvement in terms of enhanced international cooperation plays an important and critical role in the 
development and implementation of cybersecurity strategies and anti-cybercrime strategies.

923  The rationale for separating the ICT regulator from the policy-making body is to have an independent regulator that 

maintains a distance from the ministry or other government bodies which could remain as the major shareholder of the 
incumbent. An independent regulator can avoid conflict of interest that can happen if the regulator is also responsible 
for industry promotion. See: OECD, Telecommunications Regulatory Structures and Responsibilities,

frameworks, institutional development, including community participation (of women in particular), human resources 
development and strengthening of managerial systems. In addition, UNDP recognizes that capacity building is a long-
term, continuing process, in which all stakeholders participate (ministries, local authorities, non-governmental 
organizations, user groups, professional associations, academics and others). 

972  At the G8 Conference in Paris in 2000, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the French Minister of Interior, stated: “More broadly, 

we have to educate users. They must all understand what they can and can’t do on the Internet and be warned of the 
potential dangers. As use of the Internet grows, we’ll naturally have to step up our efforts in this respect”. Regarding

977  “The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation has requested companies not to keep quiet about phishing attacks 

and attacks on company IT systems, but to inform authorities, so that they can be better informed about criminal 
activities on the Internet. It is a problem for us that some companies are clearly more worried about bad publicity than 
they are about the consequences of a successful hacker attack, explained Mark Mershon, acting head of the FBI’s New

International approaches 

5.1 
A  number  of  international  organizations  work  constantly  to  analyse  the  latest  developments  in 
cybercrime and have set up working groups to develop strategies to fight these crimes.  

The G8985 

5.1.1 
In 1997, the Group of Eight (G8) established a “Subcommittee986 on High-tech Crimes”, dealing with the 
fight  against  cybercrime.987 During  their  meeting  in  Washington  DC,  United  States,  the  G8  Justice  and 
Home Affairs Ministers adopted ten Principles and a Ten-Point Action Plan to fight high-tech crimes.988 The 
Heads of the G8 subsequently endorsed these principles, which include:  

•  There must be no safe havens for those who abuse information technologies. 
• 

Investigation and prosecution of international  high-tech crimes must be coordinated among all 
concerned states, regardless of where harm has occurred.  
Law-enforcement personnel must be trained and equipped to address high-tech crimes. 

•

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
In  1999,  the  G8  specified  their  plans  regarding  the  fight  against  high-tech  crimes  at  a  Ministerial 
Conference  on  Combating  Transnational  Organized  Crimes  in  Moscow,  Russian  Federation.989 They 
expressed their concerns about crimes (such as child pornography), as well as traceability of transactions 
and  transborder  access  to  stored  data.  Their  communiqué  contains  a  number  of  principles  in  the  fight 
against cybercrime that are today found in a number of international strategies.990  
One of the practical achievements of the work done by expert groups has been the development of an 
international 24/7-network of contacts requiring participating countries to establish points of contact for 
transnational investigations that are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.991  
At the G8 Conference in Paris, France in 2000, the G8 addressed the topic of cybercrime with a call to 
prevent  lawless  digital  havens.  Already  at  that  time,  the  G8  connected  its  attempts  for  international 
solutions to the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime (the “Convention on Cybercrime”).992 In 
2001,  the  G8  discussed  procedural  instruments  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime  at  a  workshop  held  in 
Tokyo,993 focusing  on  whether  data-retention  obligations  should  be  implemented  or  whether  data 
preservation was an alternative solution.994  
In 2004, the G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministers issued a communiqué in which they addressed the 
need for the creation of global capacities in the fight against criminal uses of the Internet. 995 Again, the 
G8 took note of the Convention.996  
During the 2006 meeting in Moscow, the G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministers discussed issues related 
to the fight against cybercrime and the issues of cyberspace, and especially the necessity of improving 
effective counter-measures.997 The meeting of the G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministers was followed by 
the G8 Summit in Moscow, where the issue of cyberterrorism998 was discussed.999  
During the 2007 meeting the of the G8 Justice and Interior Ministers in Munich, Germany, the issue of 
terrorist use of the Internet was further discussed and the participants agreed to criminalize the misuse of 
the  Internet  by  terrorist  groups.1000 This  agreement  did  not  include  specific  acts  that  the  states  should 
criminalize. 
At  the  2009  meeting  of  Justice  and  Home  Affairs  Ministers  in  Rome,  Italy,  several  issues  related  to 
cybercrime  were  discussed.  The  final  declaration  states  that,  in  the  view  of  G8,  blocking  of  child 
pornography websites on the basis of blacklists updated and disseminated by international organizations 
should  be  implemented.1001 With  regard  to  cybercrime  in  general,  the  final  declaration  highlights  an 
increasing threat and points out that closer cooperation between service providers and law enforcement 
is  necessary  and  that  existing  forms  of  cooperation,  such  as  the  G8  24/7  High-Tech  Crime  Points  of 
Contact, need to be strengthened.1002  
At the G8 Summit in Muskoka, Canada, cybercrime was only briefly discussed. The Muskoka Declaration 
only  states  in  the  context  of  terrorist  activities  that  the  G8  is  concerned  about  the  growing  threat  of 
cybercrime and will intensify work to weaken terrorist and criminal networks.1003 
Cybercrime and Cybersecurity were issues that were both discusses at the e-G8 Forum, where delegations 
discussed Internet-related topics with business leader1004 as well as the G8 summit in Deauville, France. 
But although the topic cybercrime received great attention the final declaration of the summit did, unlike 
in previous years, not contain specific recommendations. The G8 only agreed to general principles such as 
the importance of security and protection from crime that underpin a strong and flourishing Internet.1005  

5.1.2  United Nations and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes1006 
The United Nations has undertaken several important approaches to address the challenge of cybercrime. 
While in the beginning its response was limited to general guidelines, the organization has in recent times 
dealt more intensively with the challenges and legal response.  

UN Convention on the Rights of the Child  
The  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  adopted  in  1989,1007 contains  several 
instruments  aiming  to  protect  children.  It  does  not  define  child  pornography,  nor  does  it  contain 

 

115 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
provisions that harmonize the criminalization of the distribution of online child pornography. However, 
Article 34  calls  upon  Member  States  to  prevent  the  exploitative  use  of  children  in  pornographic 
performances.  

UN General Assembly Resolution 45/121 
After  the  eighth  United  Nations  Congress  on  the  Prevention  of  Crime  and  the  Treatment  of  Offenders 
(held in Havana, Cuba, 27 August – 7 September 1990), the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution 
dealing  with  computer-crime  legislation.1008 Based  on  its  Resolution  45/121  (1990),  the  UN  published  a 
manual in 1994 on the prevention and control of computer-related crime.1009  

Optional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child 
Prostitution and Child Pornography 
The Optional Protocol not only addresses the issue of child pornography in general, but explicitly refers to 
the  role  of  the  Internet  in  distributing  such  material. 1010  Child  pornography  is  defined  as  any 
representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any 
representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes.1011 Article 3 requires the parties 
to criminalize certain conduct – including acts related to child pornography.  
 
Article 3 
1.  Each  State  Party  shall ensure that,  as  a  minimum, the  following acts  and  activities  are  fully covered 
under its criminal or penal law, whether these offences are committed domestically or transnationally or 
on an individual or organized basis: 
[...] 
 

(c)  Producing,  distributing,  disseminating,  importing,  exporting,  offering,  selling  or  possessing  for 
the above purposes child pornography as defined in Article 2. 

[...] 

Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders  
During the tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, 
held in Vienna in 2000, the impact of computer-related crimes was discussed in a specific workshop.1012 
The debate focused especially on the categories of crime and transnational investigation, as well as legal 
response to the phenomenon.1013 The conclusions of the workshop contain major elements of the debate 
that  is  still  ongoing:  criminalization  is  required,  legislation  needs  to  include  procedural  instruments, 
international cooperation is crucial and public-private partnership should be strengthened.1014 In addition, 
the importance of capacity building was highlighted – an issue that was picked up again in subsequent 
years.1015 The Vienna Declaration called upon the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to 
undertake work in this regard:  
 
18.  We  decide  to  develop  action-oriented  policy  recommendations  on  the  prevention  and  control  of 
computer-  related  crime,  and  we  invite  the  Commission  on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice  to 
undertake  work  in  this  regard,  taking  into  account  the  ongoing  work  in  other  forums.  We  also  commit 
ourselves to working towards enhancing our ability to prevent, investigate and prosecute high-technology 
and computer-related crime. 

UN General Assembly Resolution 55/63 
In the same year, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of 
information technologies which displays a number of similarities with the G8’s Ten-Point Action Plan from 
1997.1016 In its resolution, the General Assembly identified a number of measures to prevent the misuse of 
information technology, including:  
 

116 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse 
information technologies;  
Law  enforcement  cooperation  in  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  international  cases  of  criminal 
misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States;  
Law enforcement personnel should be trained and equipped to address the criminal misuse of information 
technologies;  
 
Resolution  55/63  invites  States  to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  combat  cybercrime  on  the  regional  and 
international  stage.  This  includes  the  development  of  domestic  legislation  to  eliminate  safe  havens  for 
criminal misuse of technologies, improving law-enforcement capacities to cooperate across borders in the 
investigation  and  prosecution  of  international  cases  of  criminal  misuse  of  information  technologies, 
improving  information  exchange,  enhancing  the  security  of  data  and  computer  systems,  training  law 
enforcement  to  deal  specifically  with  the  challenges  associated  with  cybercrime,  building  mutual 
assistance regimes and raising public awareness of the threat of cybercrime. 

UN General Assembly Resolution 56/121 
In  2002,  the  UN  General  Assembly  adopted  another  resolution  on  combating  the  criminal  misuse  of 
information  technology.1017 The  resolution  refers  to  the  existing  international  approaches  in  fighting 
cybercrime and highlights various solutions.  
Noting the work of international and regional organizations in combating high-technology crime, including 
the work of the Council of Europe in elaborating the Convention on Cybercrime as well as the work of those 
organizations in promoting dialogue between government and the private sector on safety and confidence 
in cyberspace,  
1. Invites Member States, when developing national law, policy and practice to combat the criminal misuse 
of  information  technologies,  to  take  into  account,  as  appropriate,  the  work  and  achievements  of  the 
Commission  on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice  and  of  other 
international  and  regional 
organizations;  
2. Takes note of the value of the measures set forth in its resolution 55/63, and again invites Member 
States  to  take  them  into  account  in  their  efforts  to  combat  the  criminal  misuse  of  information 
technologies;  
3. Decides to defer consideration of this subject,  pending work envisioned in the plan of action against 
high-technology and computer-related crime of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
 
Resolution 56/121 underlines the need for cooperation among states in combating the criminal misuse of 
information  technologies.  It  highlights  the  role  that  can  be  played  by  the  United  Nations  and  other 
international  and  regional  organizations.  The  resolution  further  invites  states  to  take  into  account  the 
direction provided by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice when developing national 
legislation.  

UN General Assembly Resolutions 57/239 and 58/199 
Resolutions  57/239  and  58/199  are  the  two  main  UN  General  Assembly  resolutions  dealing  with 
cybersecurity.  Without  going  into  detail  with  regard  to  cybercrime,  they  recall  Resolutions  55/06  and 
56/121.  Both  resolutions  furthermore  emphasize  the  need  for  international  cooperation  in  fighting 
cybercrime by recognizing that gaps in states’ access to and use of information technologies can diminish 
the  effectiveness  of  international  cooperation  in  combating  the  criminal  misuse  of  information 
technology.1018 

Eleventh UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
Cybercrime was discussed during the eleventh UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (the 
“UN Crime Congress”) in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2005. Several challenges associated with the emerging use 
of computer systems in committing offences and the transnational dimension were addressed both in the 

 

117 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
background paper1019 and in workshops.1020 Within the framework of the preparatory meetings in advance 
of  the  congress,  some  member  countries  such  as  Egypt  called  for  a  new  UN  convention  against 
cybercrime,  and  the  Western  Asian  regional  preparatory  meeting  called  for  the  negotiation  of  such 
convention.1021 The  possibility  of  negotiating  a  convention  was  included  in  the  discussion  guide  for  the 
eleventh UN Crime Congress.1022 However, the Member States could at this time not decide to initiate a 
harmonization  of  legislation.  The  Bangkok  Declaration  therefore  –  without  mentioning  a  specific 
instrument – refers to existing approaches.  

16.  We  note  that,  in  the  current  period  of  globalization,  information  technology  and  the  rapid 
development of new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the 
abuse  of  those  technologies  for  criminal  purposes.  We  therefore  welcome  efforts  to  enhance  and 
supplement  existing  cooperation  to  prevent,  investigate  and  prosecute  high-technology  and  computer-
related crime, including by developing partnerships with the private sector. We recognize the important 
contribution  of  the  United  Nations  to  regional  and  other  international  forums  in  the  fight  against 
cybercrime and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that 
experience, to examine the feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the 
United Nations in partnership with other similarly focused organizations. 
 

UN General Assembly Resolution 60/177 
After the eleventh UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2005, a 
declaration was adopted that highlighted the need for harmonization in the fight against cybercrime,1023 
addressing, among others, the following issues: 

international  cooperation 

We  reaffirm  the  fundamental  importance  of  implementation  of  existing  instruments  and  the  further 
development  of  national  measures  and 
in  criminal  matters,  such  as 
consideration  of  strengthening  and  augmenting  measures,  in  particular  against  cybercrime,  money-
laundering and trafficking in cultural property, as well as on extradition, mutual legal assistance and the 
confiscation, recovery and return of proceeds of crime.  
We note that, in the current period of globalization, information technology and the rapid development of 
new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the abuse of those 
technologies  for  criminal  purposes.  We  therefore  welcome  efforts  to  enhance  and  supplement  existing 
cooperation to prevent investigate and prosecute high-technology and computer-related crime, including 
by developing partnerships with the private sector. We recognize the important contribution of the United 
Nations  to  regional  and  other  international  forums  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime  and  invite  the 
Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that experience, to examine the 
feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the United Nations in partnership 
with other similarly focused organizations.  

UN  General  Assembly  Resolution  60/177  endorsed  the  2005  Bangkok  Declaration,  wherein  the 
international community’s efforts to enhance and supplement existing cooperation to prevent computer-
related  crime  were  encouraged,  inviting  further  exploration  of  the feasibility  of  providing  assistance  to 
Member  States  in  addressing  computer-related  crime  under  the  aegis  of  the  United  Nations,  and  in 
partnership with other similarly focused organizations.  

Twelfth UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
The topic of cybercrime was also discussed at the twelfth UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal 
Justice held in Brazil in 2010.1024 Within the four regional preparatory meetings for the congress, for Latin 
America and Caribbean,1025 Western Asia,1026 Asia and the Pacific1027 and Africa,1028 the countries called for 
the  development  of  an  international  convention  on  cybercrime.  Similar  calls  were  raised  within 
academia.1029 
At the congress itself, Member States took a major step toward more active involvement of the United 
Nations  in  the  debate  on  the  issue  of  computer  crime  and  cybercrime.  The  fact  that  the  delegations 
discussed  the  topics  for  two  days  and  that  additional  side  events  were  organized  highlights  the 

118 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
importance  of  the  topic,  which  was  more  intensively  discussed  than  during  the  previous  crime 
congresses.1030 The deliberations focused on two main issues: how can harmonization of legal standards 
be  achieved,  and  how  can  developing  countries  be  supported  in  fighting  cybercrime?  The  first  point  is 
especially  relevant  if  the  UN  develops  comprehensive  legal  standards  or  suggests  that  Member  States 
implement the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. In preparation of the UN Crime Congress, 
the Council of Europe had expressed concerns regarding a UN approach1031 and had called for support for 
its Convention on Cybercrime. After an intensive debate, where the limited reach of the Convention on 
Cybercrime  was  discussed  in  particular,  the  Member  States  decided  not  to  suggest  to  ratify  the 
Convention on Cybercrime but to strengthen the UN’s role in two important areas, which are reflected in 
the Salvador Declaration: 
 
41.  We  recommend  that  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime,  upon  request,  provide,  in 
cooperation  with  Member  States,  relevant  international  organizations  and  the  private  sector,  technical 
assistance  and  training  to  States  to  improve  national  legislation  and  build  the  capacity  of  national 
authorities,  in  order  to  deal  with  cybercrime,  including  the  prevention,  detection,  investigation  and 
prosecution of such crime in all its forms, and to enhance the security of computer networks. 
42. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider convening an open-
ended intergovernmental expert group to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime 
and responses to it by Member States, the international community and the private sector, including the 
exchange  of  information  on  national  legislation,  best  practices,  technical  assistance  and  international 
cooperation, with a view to examining options to strengthen existing and to propose new national and 
international legal or other responses to cybercrime. 
 
The  Member  States  thus  recommended  a  strong  mandate  for  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and 
Crimes  (UNODC)  to  provide  global  capacity  building  upon  request.  Taking  into  account  UNODC’s 
experience  in  capacity  building  related  to  criminal  legislation  and  the  fact  that,  unlike  the  Council  of 
Europe, UNODC provides a global network of regional offices, it is likely that UN through UNODC will play 
a more important role in this field in the future. 
The second recommendation highlights that, at the time of the UN Crime Congress, Member States were 
unable to decide whether to develop a legal text or not. This reflects the controversial discussion during 
the congress, where those European countries that have already ratified the Convention on Cybercrime, 
in particular, expressed their support for that instrument while a number of developing countries called 
for  a  UN  convention.  However,  the  Member  States did  respond  differently  than  at  the  eleventh  Crime 
Congress,  where  they  had  referred  to  existing  instruments.  This  time  they  did  not  refer  to  existing 
instruments  and,  even  more  importantly,  they  did  not  decide  to  recommend  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime as a global standard. Instead, the Member States recommended to invite the Commission on 
Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  study,  which  should,  inter  alia, 
examine options for strengthening existing and proposing new national and international legal or other 
responses to cybercrime. 

UN General Assembly Resolution 64/211 
In March 2010, the UN General Assembly passed a new resolution1032 as part of the “Creation of a global 
culture  of  cybersecurity” 
initiative.  Resolution  64/211  refers  to  the  two  major  resolutions  on 
cybercrime1033 as well as the two main resolutions on cybersecurity.1034 The voluntary self-assessment tool 
for national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures provided as an annex to the resolution 
calls for countries to review and update legal authorities (including those related to cybercrime, privacy, 
data protection, commercial law, digital signatures and encryption) that may be outdated or obsolete as a 
result of the rapid uptake of, and dependence upon, new information and communication technologies. 
The  resolution  further  calls  on  states  to  use  regional  international  conventions,  arrangements  and 
precedents in these reviews. 

 

119 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
13. Review and update legal authorities (including those related to cybercrime, privacy, data protection, 
commercial law, digital signatures and encryption) that may be outdated or obsolete as a result of the 
rapid  uptake  of  and  dependence  upon  new  information  and  communications  technologies,  and  use 
regional and international conventions, arrangements and precedents in these reviews. Ascertain whether 
your  country  has  developed  necessary  legislation  for  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  cybercrime, 
noting existing frameworks, for example, General Assembly resolutions 55/63 and 56/121 on combating 
the criminal misuse of information technologies, and regional initiatives, including the Council of Europe 
Convention on Cybercrime. 
14.  Determine  the  current  status  of  national  cybercrime  authorities  and  procedures,  including  legal 
authorities and national cybercrime units, and the level of understanding among prosecutors, judges and 
legislators of cybercrime issues. 
15.  Assess  the  adequacy  of  current  legal  codes  and  authorities  in  addressing  the  current  and  future 
challenges of cybercrime, and of cyberspace more generally. 
16. Examine national participation in international efforts to combat cybercrime, such as the round-the-
clock Cybercrime Point of Contact Network. 
17. Determine the requirements for national law enforcement agencies to cooperate with international 
counterparts to investigate transnational cybercrime in those instances in which infrastructure is situated 
or perpetrators reside in national territory, but victims reside elsewhere. 

The fact that four out of 18 subjects of the self-assessment tool are related to cybercrime highlights the 
importance  of  the  ability  of  law  enforcement  to  combat  cybercrime  effectively  for  maintaining 
cybersecurity.  

Intergovernmental Expert Group on Cybercrime 
Following the decision of the Member States to call upon UNODC to set up an intergovernmental working 
group, the first meeting of the group was held in Vienna in January 2011.1035 The expert group included 
representatives  of  Member  States,  intergovernmental  and  international  organizations,  specialized 
agencies, private sector and academia. During the meeting the members of the expert group discussed a 
draft structure for a comprehensive study analysing the issue of cybercrime, as well as the response.1036 
With  regard  to  the  legal  response,  a  number  of  members  underline  the  usefulness  of  existing 
international legal instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime (UNTOC) and the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the desirability of elaborating a 
global legal instrument to address specifically the problem of cybercrime. It was agreed that the decision 
on whether a global instrument should be developed will be made after the study was conducted.  

Other resolutions and activities 
In  addition,  a  number  of  United  Nations  system  decisions,  resolutions  and  recommendations  address 
issues related to cybercrime, the most important being the following: the United Nations Office for Drugs 
and  Crime  (UNODC)  and  the  Commission  on  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Justice1037 adopted  a 
resolution on effective crime prevention and criminal justice responses to combat sexual exploitation of 
children.1038 In  2004,  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Council1039 adopted  a  resolution  on 
international  cooperation  in  the  prevention,  investigation,  prosecution  and  punishment  of  fraud,  the 
criminal  misuse  and  falsification  of  identity  and  related  crimes.1040 A  working  group  was  established  in 
2005.1041 A  core  group  of  experts  on  identity-related  crime  was  created  to  undertake  a  comprehensive 
study  on  the  issue.  In  2007,  the  ECOSOC  adopted  a  resolution  on  international  cooperation  in  the 
prevention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of economic fraud and identity-related crime.1042 
Neither of these two resolutions explicitly addresses the challenges of Internet-related crimes,1043 but they 
are applicable to those offences as well. Based on ECOSOC Resolution 2004/261044 and ECOSOC Resolution 
2007/20,1045 UNODC in 2007 established a core group of experts to exchange views on the best course of 
action.1046 The  core  group  has  undertaken  several  studies  that  included  aspects  of  Internet-related 
crimes.1047 In  2004,  ECOSOC  had  adopted  a  resolution  on  the  sale  of  licit  drugs  via  the  Internet  that 
explicitly took account of a phenomenon related to a computer crime.1048

UNODC/ITU Memorandum of Understanding 
In  2011  UNODC  and  the  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  signed  a  memorandum  of 
understanding  related  to  cybercrime.1049 The  MoU  covers  cooperation  (especially  capacity  building  and 
technical assistance for developing countries), training and joint workshops. With regard to the capacity 
building  activities  the  two  organizations  can  refer  to  a  wide  network  of  field  offices  in  all  continents. 
Further more the organizations agreed to a joined dissemination of information and knowledge and data 
analysis. 

International Telecommunication Union1050 

5.1.3 
The  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU),  as  a  specialized  agency  within  the  United  Nations, 
plays  a  leading  role  in  the  standardization  and  development  of  telecommunications  as  well  as 
cybersecurity issues.  

World Summit on the Information Society 
Among other activities, ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 
that took place in two phases in Geneva, Switzerland (2003) and in Tunis, Tunisia (2005). Governments, 
policy-makers  and  experts  from  around  the  world  shared  ideas  and  experiences  about  how  best  to 
address the emerging issues associated with of the development of a global information society, including 
the  development  of  compatible  standards  and  laws.  The  outputs  of  the  Summit  are  contained  in  the 
Geneva Declaration of Principles, the Geneva Plan of Action; the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda 
for the Information Society.  
The Geneva Plan of Action highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime:1051  
 
C5.Building confidence and security in the use of ICTs 
12. Confidence and security are among the main pillars of the Information Society. 
[…] 
 

b.  Governments,  in  cooperation  with  the  private  sector,  should  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to 
cyber-crime and misuse of ICTs by: developing guidelines that take into account ongoing efforts in 
these  areas;  considering  legislation  that  allows  for  effective  investigation  and  prosecution  of 
misuse;  promoting  effective  mutual  assistance  efforts;  strengthening  institutional  support  at  the 
international level for preventing, detecting and recovering from such incidents; and encouraging 
education and raising awareness. 

[…] 
 
Cybercrime was also addressed at the second phase of WSIS in Tunis in 2005. The Tunis Agenda for the 
Information  Society1052 highlights  the  need for  international  cooperation  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime 
and  refers  to  the  existing  legislative  approaches  such  as  the  UN  General  Assembly  resolutions  and  the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime:  
 
40. We underline the importance of the prosecution of cybercrime, including cybercrime committed in one 
jurisdiction,  but  having  effects  in  another.  We  further  underline  the  necessity  of  effective  and  efficient 
tools and actions, at national and international levels, to promote international cooperation among, inter 
alia,  law-enforcement  agencies  on  cybercrime.  We  call  upon  governments  in  cooperation  with  other 
stakeholders to develop necessary legislation for the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, noting 
existing  frameworks,  for  example,  UNGA  Resolutions  55/63  and  56/121  on  “Combating  the  criminal 
misuse of information technologies” and regional initiatives including, but not limited to, the Council of 
Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime.

Global Cybersecurity Agenda 
As an outcome of WSIS, ITU was nominated as the sole facilitator for Action Line C5 dedicated to building 
of  confidence  and  security in  the  use  of information  and  communication  technology.1053 At  the  second 
Facilitation  Meeting  for  WSIS  Action  Line  C5  in  2007,  the  ITU  Secretary-General  highlighted  the 
importance of international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime and announced the launch of the 
ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda.1054 The Global Cybersecurity Agenda is made up of seven key goals,1055 
and  built  upon  five  strategic  pillars1056,  including  the  elaboration  of  strategies  for  the  development  of 
model cybercrime legislation. The seven goals are the following: 
 
1  Elaboration  of  strategies  for  the  development  of  a  model  cybercrime  legislation  that  is  globally 
applicable and interoperable with existing national and regional legislative measures. 
2 Elaboration of strategies for the creation of appropriate national and regional organizational structures 
and policies on cybercrime.  
3  Development  of  a  strategy  for  the  establishment  of  globally  accepted  minimum  security  criteria  and 
accreditation schemes for software applications and systems.  
4  Development  of  strategies  for  the  creation  of  a  global  framework  for  watch,  warning  and  incident 
response to ensure cross-border coordination between new and existing initiatives. 
5 Development of strategies for the creation and endorsement of a generic and universal digital identity 
system  and  the  necessary  organizational  structures  to  ensure  the  recognition  of  digital  credentials  for 
individuals across geographical boundaries. 
6  Development  of  a  global  strategy  to  facilitate  human  and  institutional  capacity-building  to  enhance 
knowledge and know-how across sectors and in all the above-mentioned areas.  
7  Advice  on  potential  framework  for  a  global  multi-stakeholder  strategy  for  international  cooperation, 
dialogue and coordination in all the above-mentioned areas. 
 
In order to analyse and develop measure and strategies with regard to the seven goals of the GCA, the ITU 
Secretary-General  created  a  high-level  expert  group  (HLEG)  bringing  together  representatives  from 
Member  States,  industry  as  well  as  the  scientific  field. 1057 In  2008,  the  expert  group  concluded 
negotiations and published the “Global Strategic Report”.1058 Most relevant with regard to cybercrime are 
the  legal  measures  contained  in  Chapter 1.  In  addition  to  an  overview  of  different  regional  and 
international  approaches  in  fighting  cybercrime,1059 the  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  criminal  law 
provisions,1060 procedural  instruments,1061 regulations  governing  the  responsibility  of  Internet  service 
providers1062 and safeguards to protect fundamental rights of Internet users.1063  

Capacity building 
Under  the  umbrella  of  the  ITU  GCA,  ITU-D  works  to  assist  countries  in  implementing  harmonized 
cybersecurity-related activities at the national, regional and international level. ITU’s mandate in capacity 
building  was  emphasized  by  Resolution  130  (Rev.  Guadalajara,  2010)  of  the  ITU  Plenipotentiary 
Conference.  Based  on  the  resolution,  ITU  has  the  mandate  to  assist  Member  States,  in  particular 
developing  countries,  in  the  elaboration  of  appropriate  and  workable  legal  measures  relating  to 
protection against cyberthreats. 
This  includes  capacity-building  activities  in  the  development  of  national  strategies,  legislation  and 
enforcement, organizational structures (e.g. watch, warning and incident response), among other areas. 
ITU has organized several regional conferences which have specifically addressed, inter alia, the issue of 
cybercrime. 1064 Together  with  partners  from  the  public  and  private  sectors,  ITU-D  has  developed 
cybersecurity/CIIP  tools  to  assist  Member  States  in  raising  national  awareness,  conducting  national 
cybersecurity self-assessments, revising legislation and expanding watch, warning and incident-response 
capabilities.  These  tools  include  Understanding  Cybercrime:  A  Guide  for  Developing  Countries,  the  ITU 
National Cybersecurity/CIIP Self-Assessment Tool and the ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.

Regional approaches 

5.2 
In  addition  to  the  international  organizations  that  are  globally  active,  a  number  of  international 
organizations that focus of specific regions have move forward on activities that deal with issues related 
to cybercrime.  

Council of Europe1065 

5.2.1 
The Council of Europe is playing an active role in addressing the challenges of cybercrime.  

Activities until 1995 
In  1976,  the  Council  of  Europe  highlighted  the  international  nature  of  computer-related  crimes  and 
discussed  the  topic  at  a  conference  dealing  with  aspects  of  economic  crimes.  This  topic  has  since 
remained on its agenda.1066 In 1985, the Council of Europe appointed an Expert Committee1067 to discuss 
the legal aspects of computer crimes.1068 In 1989, the European Committee on Crime Problems adopted 
the  “Expert  Report  on  Computer-Related  Crime”,1069 analysing  the  substantive  criminal  legal  provisions 
necessary to fight new forms of electronic crimes, including computer fraud and forgery. The Committee 
of Ministers in 1989 adopted a recommendation1070 that specifically highlighted the international nature 
of computer crime:  
 
The  Committee  of  Ministers,  under  the  terms  of  Article  15.b  of  the  Statute  of  the  Council  of  Europe, 
Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members; 
Recognising the importance of an adequate and quick response to the new challenge of computer-related 
crime; Considering that computer-related crime often has a transfrontier character; Aware of the resulting 
need for further harmonisation of the law and practice, and for improving international legal co-operation, 
Recommends the governments of member states to : 
 

1.  Take  into account,  when  reviewing  their  legislation  or  initiating  new  legislation, the  report  on 
computer-related  crime  elaborated  by  the  European  Committee  on  Crime  Problems,  and  in 
particular the guidelines for the national legislatures; 

 

123 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

2. Report to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe during 1993 on any developments in 
their legislation, judicial practice and experiences of international legal co-operation in respect of 
computer-related crime. 

 
In 1995, the Committee of Ministers adopted another recommendation dealing with the problems arising 
from  transnational  computer  crimes. 1071 Guidelines  for  the  drafting  of  adequate  legislation  were 
summarized in the Appendix to the Recommendation.1072  

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Additional Protocol 
The European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC) decided in 1996 to set up a committee of experts to 
deal with cybercrime.1073 The idea of going beyond principles for another recommendation and drafting a 
convention was present at the time of the establishment of the Committee of Experts.1074 Between 1997 
and 2000, the committee held ten meetings in plenary and fifteen meetings of its open-ended Drafting 
Group.  The  Assembly  adopted  the  draft  Convention  on  Cybercrime  in  the  second  part  of  its  plenary 
session in April 2001.1075 The finalized draft Convention was submitted for approval to CDPC and to the 
Committee  of  Ministers  for  adoption  and  opening  for  signature.1076 The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was 
opened for signature at a signing ceremony in Budapest on 23 November 2001, during which 30 countries 
signed the Convention on Cybercrime (including four non-members of the Council of Europe – Canada, 
United States, Japan and South Africa – that participated in the negotiations). By April 2012, 47 states1077 
have  signed  and  33  states1078 have  ratified1079 the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.  In  the 
meantime seven states were invited to accede to the Convention on Cybercrime, but have not done so.1080 
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  today  recognized  as  an  important  regional  instrument  in  the  fight 
against cybercrime and is supported by different international organizations.1081  
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  followed  by  the  First  Additional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime.1082 During the negotiations on the text of the Convention on Cybercrime, it turned out that 
the criminalization of racism and the distribution of xenophobic material were particularly controversial 
matters.1083 Some  countries  in  which  the  principle  of  freedom  of  expression1084 was  strongly  protected 
expressed  their  concern  that  if  provisions  are  included  in  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  that  violate 
freedom of expression they would be unable to sign the Convention.1085 In the fourth draft version from 
1998,  the  Convention  still  included  a  provision  that  required  the  parties  to  criminalize  illegal  content 
“concerning  in  particular  matters  such  as  child  pornography  and  racial  hatred”.1086 To  avoid  a  situation 
where countries would not be able to sign the Convention because of freedom of expression concerns, 
those  issues  were  removed  from  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  during  the  drafting  process  and 
integrated  into  a  separate  protocol.  By  January  2012,  35  states1087 have  signed  and  20  states1088 have 
ratified the Additional Protocol.  

Debate about the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
Currently, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is still the instrument with the broadest reach 
supported by different international organizations.1089 However, the debate in the twelfth Crime Congress 
highlighted that ten years after its opening for signature, the impact of the Convention is limited.1090  

Limitation of reach of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
As of Januar 2011, the United States is the only country outside Europe that has ratified the instrument. It 
is  true  that  the  impact  of  the  Convention  cannot  be  measured  solely  by  the  number  of  signatures  or 
ratifications,  since  countries  such  as  Argentina,1091 Pakistan,1092 Philippines,1093 Egypt,1094 Botswana1095 and 
Nigeria1096 have used the Convention as a model and drafted parts of their legislation in accordance with 
the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  without  formally  acceding  to  it.  Even  in  the  case  of  those  countries, 
however, it is uncertain to what extent they have used the Convention on Cybercrime as a model. Some 
of them have also used other law texts, such as the EU Directive on Attacks against Information Systems 
and the Commonwealth Model Law. Since those laws display a number of similarities to the Convention 
on  Cybercrime  and,  in  addition,  provisions  have  very  rarely  been  reproduced  word  for  word,  but  have 

124 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
been adjusted to the countries’ requirements, this makes it nearly impossible to determine if and to what 
extent a country has used the Convention as a guideline. Despite this, the Council of Europe claims that 
more  than  100  countries  have  either  signed,  ratified  or  used  the  Convention  when  drafting  domestic 
legislation.1097 However, this number could not be verified. The Council of Europe does not disclose the 
names of the countries concerned, and only refers to an “internal list”. Not even the precise number of 
countries is disclosed. Even if it were possible to prove that 100 countries have used the Convention on 
Cybercrime, this does not necessarily mean that they have harmonized their legislation in line with the 
Convention.  The  rather  vague  information  published  by  the  Council  of  Europe  also  leaves  open  the 
question of whether all provisions from the Convention on Cybercrime have been implemented, or only 
one.  

Speed of the ratification process 
The limited territorial reach was not the only concern discussed at the twelfth UN Crime Congress. The 
speed of signature and ratification certainly remains an issue. Nine years after the initial signature by 30 
states on 23 November 2001, only 17 further states have signed the Convention on Cybercrime. In this 
time, no non-member of the Council of Europe has acceded to the Convention, although eight countries 
were invited.1098 The number of ratifications has evolved as follows: 2002 (21099), 2003 (21100), 2004 (41101), 
2005 (31102), 2006 (71103), 2007 (31104), 2008 (21105), 2009 (31106), 2010 (41107) and in 2011 (21108). As slow as 
the ratification process is the implementation process. In average it takes a country more than five years 
between  signature  and  ratification  of  the  Convention.  The  differences  between  the  countries  are 
significant. While it took Albania only a bit more than half a year to ratify the convention Germany needed 
almost ten years. 

No evaluation of the ratification 
The  Council  of  Europe  has  so  far  never  evaluated  whether  those  countries  that  have  submitted  their 
ratification instrument have actually implemented the Convention on Cybercrime in accordance with the 
requirements. Especially in the case of the first countries that ratified the Convention, there are serious 
concerns with regard to its full implementation. Even in large countries such as Germany and the United 
States, it is unlikely that the Convention has been fully implemented. Germany, for example, contrary to 
the intent of Article 2 of the Convention on Cybercrime, does not criminalize illegal access to computer 
systems, but only illegal access to computer data.1109 The country profile of the US cybercrime legislation 
posted  on  the  Council  of  Europe  website  indicates  that  18  USC.  § 1030(a)(1)  –  (5)  corresponds  to 
Article 2.1110 Unlike  Article 2  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  however,  18  USC  § 1030(a)  does  not 
criminalize  mere  access  to  a  computer  system.  In  addition  to  “access”  to  a  computer  system,  the 
provision requires further acts (like for example “obtaining” information).1111  

Global debate 
One  frequently  criticized  aspect  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  the  inadequate  representation  of 
developing  countries  in  the  drafting  process.1112 Despite  the  transnational  dimension  of  cybercrime,  its 
impact  in  the  different  regions  of  the  world  is  different.  This  is  especially  relevant  for  developing 
countries.1113 Not only was the Convention on Cybercrime negotiated without any broad involvement of 
developing  countries  in  Asia,  Africa  and  Latin  America,  but  it  also  places  restrictive  conditions  on  the 
participation of non-members of the Council of Europe, even though it was designed to be open to non-
members.  Based  on  Article 37  thereof,  accession  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  requires  consulting 
with and obtaining the unanimous consent of the contracting states to the Convention on Cybercrime. In 
addition, participation in the deliberations on possible future amendments is restricted to parties to the 
Convention.1114 The  debate  within  the  framework  of  preparation  of  the  twelfth  UN  Crime  Congress 
showed  that  developing  countries  in  particular  are  interested  in  an  international  approach  rather  than 
joining  regional  initiatives.  During  the  regional  preparatory  meetings  for  the  twelfth  United  Nations 
Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice for Latin America and Caribbean1115, Western Asia1116, 
Asia and Pacific1117 and Africa,1118 countries called for the development of an international convention on 
cybercrime. Similar calls were raised within academia.1119  

 

125 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Lack of response to recent trends 
Cybercrime  is  an  area  of  crime  that  is  constantly  changing.1120 In  the  1990s,  when  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime was developed, terrorist use of the Internet1121, botnet attacks1122 and phishing1123 either were 
not known or did not play as important a role as they do today,1124 and could therefore not be addressed 
with specific solutions. Even the Council of Europe has recognized that the Convention on Cybercrime is 
partly out of date. This can be demonstrated by comparing the provisions relating to child pornography in 
the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime and the 2007 Convention on the Protection of Children. Article 20 
(1)(f) of the Convention on the Protection of Children criminalizes “knowingly obtaining access, through 
information and communication technologies, to child pornography”. This act is not criminalized by the 
Convention  on  Cybercrime,  although  the  reference  to  ICTs  underlines  that  it  is  a  crime  that  can  be 
characterized  as  cybercrime.  Based  on the  motivation  provided  in  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters 
decided to include this provision to cover cases where offenders view child images online by accessing 
child-pornography  sites  but  without  downloading  material.  This  means,  as  a  consequence,  that  the 
Convention on Cybercrime does not cover such acts and therefore in this regard does not even meet the 
Council of Europe’s own current standards.  
The  same 
instruments.  Interception  of  voice-over-IP  (VoIP) 
communication,  the  admissibility  of  digital  evidence  and  procedures  to  deal  with  the  emerging  use  of 
encryption technology and means of anonymous communication are issues that are of great relevance to, 
but not addressed by, the Convention on Cybercrime. In its ten years of existence, the Convention has 
never  been  amended  and,  apart  from  the  Additional  Protocol  on  xenophobic  material,  no  additional 
provisions or instruments have been added. 
With  changing  technologies  and  criminal  behaviour,  criminal  law  needs  to  be  adjusted.  As  pointed  out 
before, requirements in terms of cybercrime legislation have changed in the last ten years. An update of 
the Convention on Cybercrime would therefore be highly necessary. Other regional organizations, such as 
the  European  Union,  have  just  reviewed  their  legal  instruments  addressing  cybercrime,  which  were 
introduced more recently, around five years ago. Despite the urgency of an update, it is unlikely that such 
a  process  will  take  place.  The  European  Union,  a  strong  supporter  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime, 
declared recently that in its view “updating of the Convention [on Cybercrime] [...] cannot be considered a 
feasible option”.1125 

is  true  with  regard  to  procedural 

Focus on accession of countries that provide infrastructure instead of developing countries  
Within the last ten years that Council of Europe did not succeed to get accessions by small and developing 
countries.  One  of  the  reasons  is  the  fact  that  the  Convention  was  negotiated  with  an  inadequate 
representation  of  developing  countries.1126 Especially  Asia  and  Africa  were  underrepresented  and  Latin 
America  was  not  represented  at  all.  Although  the  Council  of  Europe  invites  representatives  from 
developing countries to it’s main Cybercrime conference those countries are not allowed to participate in 
in  the  deliberations  on  possible  future  amendments  as  those  meetings  are  restricted  to  parties  to  the 
Convention.1127  
Differences  compared  to  truly  international  instruments  such  as  UN  conventions  can  also  be  observed 
when it comes to the accession process. Although the process of becoming part of the Convention – that 
was  designed  as  open  to  non-members  –  restrictive  conditions  apply.  Unlike  a  UN  Convention,  the 
accession to the Convention on Cybercrime requires consultation with and the unanimous consent of the 
contracting states to the Convention.1128 Consequently especially the developing countries have started to 
call for a (more) international approach during the preparation of the 12th UN Crime Congress. Within the 
regional preparatory meetings for the Congress for Latin America and Caribbean1129, Western Asia1130, Asia 
and Pacific1131 and Africa,1132 the participating countries called for the development of such international 
instrument.  
Although the strategy of the Council of Europe to focus on western countries seem logical as they host the 
infrastructure, the involvement of developing countries is crucial if focus should include potential victims. 
In  2005,  the  number  of  Internet  users  in  developing  countries  surpassed  the  number  in  industrial 
nations. 1133 By  excluding  developing  countries  and  focussing  instead  on  developed  countries  that 

126 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
(currently)  provide  most  of  the  infrastructure  and  services,  two  crucial  aspects  are  ignored:  the 
importance  of  protecting  the  (majority)  of  users  of  Internet  services,  and,  secondly,  the  strongly 
increasing  influence  of  emerging  countries  like  India,  China  and  Brazil.  Without  supporting  developing 
countries  in  establishing  legislation  that  enables  them  to  investigate  cases  in  which  their  nationals  are 
affected  and  in  addition  also  to  cooperate  internationally  with  other  law  enforcement  units  regarding 
identification of offenders, Cybercrime investigations will be more difficult if they involve those countries. 
The fact that in the last 10 years no developing country has acceded to the Convention or has ratified it, 
shows  the  limitations  of  a  regional  approach.  Taking  further  into  account  that  in  the  last  decade  the 
Council of Europe has only invited eight countries (out of 146 UN Member States that have not sign the 
Convention)  to  accede  to  the  Convention,  highlights  the  limited  energy  invested  in  this  regard.  This  is 
certainly related to the fact that the needs of developing countries with regard to legislation as well as 
capacity building and technical assistance in general go beyond the mechanisms of the Convention. Until 
today  the  Council  of  Europe  focuses  on  assisting  countries  in  bringing  their  legislation  in  line  with  the 
Convention, but does not provide any assistance in drafting legislation that goes beyond the Convention 
(e.g.  to  close  the  above  mentioned  gaps).  Further  more  the  countries  might  already  require  help  with 
drafting of national legislation because the provisions contained in the Convention require an adjustment 
process during the implementation. Countries for example need to determine who is authorized to order 
a 
(sworn 
evidence/affidavit/information).  
This  issue  was  discussed  in  detail  during  the  12th  UN  Crime  Congress  and  led  the  UN  Member  States 
deciding  upon  strengthening  the  capacity  building  mandate  of  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and 
Crimes  (UNODC)

Telecommunications Union (ITU) have recently received similar mandates.1135

Not designed for small and developing countries 
Small and developing countries face difficulties in implementing the standards of the Convention. The fact 
that the smallest Council of Europe Member States did not ratified1136 the Convention in the last ten years 
clearly  underlines  that  it  is  not  only  challenging  for  small  countries  outside  of  Europe  but  also  small 
European countries.  
One of the provisions that causes difficulties when it comes to the implementation in small countries is 
the need to establish a 24/7 point of contact. Such contact point can have a highly positive impact on the 
speed of investigations and Article 35 is consequently one of the most important instruments provided by 
the Convention.1137 However, it should be mentioned that recently the Council of Europe has published a 
study analysing the effectiveness of international cooperation against cybercrime1138 and a study on the 
functioning of 24/7 points of contact against cybercrime1139 and the result of these two studies is that not 
all  countries  which  have  ratified  the  Convention  have  established  such  a  contact  point  even  countries 
which have provided such a contact point often only use it for limited purposes.  
The  main  problem  for  developing  countries  is  the  fact  that  the  establishment  of  such  contact  point  is 
mandatory.  While  for  developed  countries  establishing  and  maintaining  such  a  contact  point  will  most 
likely not be challenging utilising a specialized police force dealing with cybercrime in night and day shifts, 
is however a challenge for countries where the specialized police force dealing with cybercrime consists of 
only  one  single  police  man.  In  those  cases  the  obligation  will  require  significant  investments.  That  the 
accession to and implementation of the Convention does not have associated costs for the countries, as 
was recently stated by a Council of Europe representative at a conference in the Pacific1140 is therefore 
only accurate if indirect costs, e.g. for maintaining a 24/7 contact point or for implementing technology to 
record traffic data in real time, are excluded.  

No comprehensive approach  
It  was  one  of  the  key  intentions  of  the  Convention  to  provide  a  comprehensive  legal  approach  that 
addresses  all  relevant  areas  of  cybercrime.1141 But  comparing  the  Convention  with  other  approaches  – 
especially the Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related Crime1142 as well as the EU 
instruments such as the E-Commerce Directive1143, shows that important aspects are missing. Examples 

 

127 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
are  provisions  dealing  with  the  admissibility  of  electronic  evidence1144 or  with  the  liability  of  Internet 
Service  Providers  (ISPs).  Especially  the  missing  provision  of  an,  at  least,  basic  regulatory  framework 
related to the admissibility of electronic evidence has significant consequences as electronic evidence is 
widely  characterized  as  a  new  category  of  evidence. 1145 And  unless  a  country  has  other  instruments  in 
place or its courts hold such evidence admissible, the country might not be able to sentence any offenders 
despite having fully implemented the Convention.  

Convention on the Protection of Children 
Within its approach to improve the protection of minors against sexual exploitation, the Council of Europe 
introduced a new Convention in 2007.1146 On the first day the Convention on the Protection of Children 
opened  for  signature  23  states  signed  the  Convention.  By  April  2012,  it  had  42  signatory  states,1147 of 
which  18  have  ratified  the  Convention.1148 One  of  the  key  aims  of  the  Convention  on  the  Protection  of 
Children  is  the  harmonization  of  criminal  law  provisions  aimed  at  protecting  children  from  sexual 
exploitation.1149 To achieve this aim, the Convention contains a set of criminal law provisions. Apart from 
criminalization  of  the  sexual  abuse  of  children  (Article 18),  the  Convention  contains  provisions  dealing 
with the exchange of child pornography (Article 20) and the solicitation of children for sexual purposes 
(Article 23). 

European Union1150 

5.2.2 
Over  the  past  decade,  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  developed  several  legal  instruments  addressing 
aspects  of  cybercrime.  While  those  instruments  are  in  general  only  binding  for the  27 Member  States, 
several  countries  and  regions  are  using  the  EU  standards  as  a  reference  point  in  their  national  and 
regional discussions on harmonization of legislation.1151 

Situation until December 2009 
Until 2009, the EU’s mandate in regard to criminal law was limited and contested.1152 In addition to the 
challenge posed by the fact that the mandate was limited, it was uncertain whether the mandate for any 
criminal legislation, including cybercrime, lay with the so-called “First Pillar” (European Community) or the 
“Third Pillar” (European Union).1153 Since the prevailing opinion was that the third pillar was responsible, 
harmonization was therefore only possible on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation within the third 
pillar of the European Union dealing with police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.1154 When, in 
2005,  the  Court  of  Justice  declared  a  third-pillar  instrument  in  the  area  of  criminal  law  (the  Council 
Framework Decision on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law1155) to be unlawful1156, 
the  distribution  of  power  was  challenged  for  the  first  time.  The  court  decided  that  the  Framework 
Decision, being indivisible, infringed EU Article 47 as it encroached on the powers which EC Article 175 
confers on the Community. This decision had a major influence on the debate on harmonizing criminal 
law within the European Union. The European Commission (EC), which is responsible for upholding the 
Union’s treaties, pointed out that as a result of the judgement a number of framework decisions dealing 
with criminal law were entirely or partly incorrect, since all or some of their provisions were adopted on 
an incorrect legal basis.1157 Despite the recognition of the new possibilities to evaluate a mandate within 
the  first  pillar,  however,  initiatives  from  the  EC  were  limited  owing  to  lack  of  coverage  of  the  subject 
matter  in  the  first  pillar.  In  2007,  the  Court  of  Justice  confirmed  the  legal  practice  in  a  second  court 
decision.1158 

Situation after the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon 
The  Treaty  of  Lisbon  (the  “Reform  Treaty”),1159 which  came  into  force  in  December 2009,  changed  the 
function of the European Union significantly. In addition to rescinding the distinction between “first pillar” 
and “third pillar”, for the first time it provided the EU with a solid mandate in the field of computer crime. 
Arts. 82  to 86  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  (TFEU)  provide  the  EU  with  a 
mandate  for  harmonizing  criminal  law  legislation  (substantive  criminal  law  and  procedural  law).  Most 
relevant with regard to cybercrime is TFEU Article 83.1160 It authorizes the EU to establish minimum rules 
concerning  the  definition  of  criminal  offences  and  sanctions  in  relation  to  serious  crime  with  a  cross-

128 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
border  dimension.  Computer  crime  is  specifically  mentioned  as  one  of  the  relevant  areas  of  crime  in 
Article 83, paragraph 1. As the term computer crime is broader than cybercrime it authorizes the EU to 
regulate both areas. Based on Article 4, paragraph 2.j, the development of computer-crime legislation falls 
under  shared  competence  between  the  EU  and  Member  States.  This  enables  the  EU  to  adopt  legally 
binding acts (Article 2, paragraph 2) and limits the ability of Member States to exercise their competence 
to the extent that the EU has not exercised its competence. 
In the “Stockholm Programme”, adopted by the European Council in 2009, the EU underlined that it will 
make use of the new mandate.1161 The programme is a definition of the focus of EU work in the area of 
justice and home affairs for a period of five years, and follows the Hague Programme which expired in 
2009.1162 It underlines the EU’s intention to make use of the mandate by referring to the areas of crime 
mentioned  in  TFEU  Article 83,  paragraph 1,  and  giving  priority  to  the  areas  of  child  pornography  and 
computer crime.1163  

Overview of EU instruments and guidelines 
Despite the fundamental changes in the structure of the EU, instruments that have been adopted in the 
past  remain  in  force.  Based  on  Article 9  of  the  Protocol  on  Transitional  Provisions,  the  instruments 
adopted on the basis of the Treaty on European Union prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon 
shall be preserved until those acts are repealed, annulled or amended in implementation of the treaties. 
The following chapter therefore provides an overview of all relevant EU instruments.  

launched  the 

General policies  
Back  in  1996  already,  the  EU  addressed  risks  related  to  the  Internet  in  a  communication  dealing  with 
illegal  and  harmful  content  on  the  Internet.1164 The  EU  highlighted  the  importance  of  cooperation 
between Member States to combat illegal content online.1165 In 1999, the European Parliament and the 
Council adopted an action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet and combating illegal and harmful 
content on global networks.1166 The action plan focused on self-regulation rather than criminalization. Also 
in  1999,  the  EU 
initiative  “eEurope”,  by  adopting  the  European  Commission’s 
Communication “eEurope – An Information Society for all”.1167 The initiative defines key goals, but does 
not  deal  with  criminalization  of  illegal  acts  committed  by  using  information  technology.  In  2001,  the 
European  Commission  (EC)  published  a  Communication  titled  “Creating  a  Safer  Information  Society  by 
Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime”.1168 In this 
communication, the EC analysed and addressed the problem of cybercrime and pointed out the need for 
effective action to deal with threats to the integrity, availability and dependability of information systems 
and networks. 
 
Information  and  communication 
infrastructures  have  become  a  critical  part  of  our  economies. 
Unfortunately, these infrastructures have their own vulnerabilities and offer new opportunities for criminal 
conduct.  These  criminal  activities  may  take  a  large  variety  of  forms  and  may  cross  many  borders. 
Although, for a number of reasons, there are no reliable statistics, there is little doubt that these offences 
constitute  a  threat  to  industry  investment  and  assets,  and  to  safety  and  confidence  in  the  information 
society. Some recent examples of denial of service and virus attacks have been reported to have caused 
extensive financial damage.  
There  is  scope  for  action  both  in  terms  of  preventing  criminal  activity  by  enhancing  the  security  of 
information  infrastructures  and  by  ensuring  that the  law  enforcement  authorities  have  the  appropriate 
means to act, whilst fully respecting the fundamental rights of individuals.1169 
The Commission having participated in both the C.oE. and the G8 discussions, recognises the complexity 
and difficulties associated with procedural law issues. But effective co-operation within the EU to combat 
Cybercrime  is  an  essential  element  of  a  safer  Information  Society  and  the  establishment  of  an  Area  of 
Freedom, Security and Justice1170.  

 

129 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The Commission will bring forward legislative proposals under the Title VI of the TEU:  
[...]  to  further  approximate  substantive  criminal  law  in  the  area  of  high-tech  crime.  This  will  include 
offences related to hacking and denial of service attacks. The Commission will also examine the scope for 
action  against  racism  and  xenophobia  on  the  Internet  with  a  view  to  bringing  forward  a  Framework 
Decision under Title VI of the TEU covering both off-line and on-line racist and xenophobic activity. Finally, 
the problem of illicit drugs on the Internet will also be examined.1171 
The Commission will continue to play a full role in ensuring co-ordination between Member States in other 
international  for  a  in  which  Cybercrime  is  being  discussed  such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  and  G8.  The 
Commission’s  initiatives  at  EU  level  will  take  full  account  of  progress  in  other  international  fora,  while 
seeking to achieve approximation within the EU.1172  
In  addition  to  the  communication  on  computer-related  crime  the  EC  published  a  communication  on 
“Network  and  Information  Security”1173 in  2001  that  analysed  the  problems  in  network  security  and 
drafted a strategic outline for action in this area.  
Both these EC communications emphasized the need for approximation of substantive criminal law within 
the  European  Union  –  especially  with  regard  to  attacks  against  information  systems.  Harmonization  of 
substantive criminal law within the European Union in the fight against cybercrime is recognized as a key 
element of all initiatives at the EU level.1174  
In 2007, the EC published a communication towards a general policy on the fight against cybercrime.1175 
The communication summarizes the current situation and emphasizes the importance of the Council of 
Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  as  the  predominant  international  instrument  in  the  fight  against 
cybercrime. In addition, the communication points out the issues that the EC will focus on with regard to 
its future activities. These include: 

strengthening international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime; 

• 
•  better coordinated financial support for training activities; 
• 
the organization of a meeting of law-enforcement experts; 
• 
strengthening the dialogue with industry; 
•  monitoring the evolving threats of cybercrime to evaluate the need for further legislation. 

E-Commerce Directive (2000) 
The  EU  Directive  on  Electronic  Commerce1176 addresses,  among  other  issues,  the  liability  of  Internet 
service  provider  (ISP)  for  acts  committed  by  third  parties  (Article 12  et  seq.).  Taking  into  account  the 
challenges stemming from the international dimension of the network, the drafters decided to develop 
legal  standards  to  provide  a  framework  for  the  overall  development  of  the  information  society  and  to 
support overall economic development as well as the work of law-enforcement agencies.1177 It is based on 
the  consideration  that  development  of  information-society  services  is  hampered  by  a  number  of  legal 
obstacles  to  the  proper  functioning  of  the  internal  market,  which  gives  the  European  Community  its 
mandate.1178 The regulation of liability is based on the principle of graduated responsibility.1179 Although 
the Directive highlights that there is no intention to harmonize the field of criminal law as such, it does 
also regulate liability under criminal law.1180  

Council Decision to combat child pornography on the Internet (1999) 
In 2000, the Council of the European Union undertook an approach to address child pornography on the 
Internet. The Decision that was adopted is a follow-up to the 1996 communication on illegal and harmful 
content on the Internet1181 and the related 1999 action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet and 
combating  illegal  and  harmful  content  on  global  networks.1182 However,  the  Decision  does  not  contain 
obligations with regard to the adoption of specific criminal law provisions.  

130 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
European Union Council Framework Decision on combating fraud (2001) 
In  2001,  the  EU  adopted  the  first  legal  framework  directly  addressing  aspects  of  cybercrime.  The  EU 
Framework Decision on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment1183 contains 
obligations to harmonize criminal law legislation with regard to specific aspects of computer-related fraud 
and  the  production  of  instruments,  such  as  computer  programs,  that  are  specifically  adopted  for  the 
purpose of committing an offence mentioned in the Framework Decision.1184  
 

Article 3 – Offences related to computers 
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the following conduct is a criminal 
offence when committed intentionally: performing or causing a transfer of money or monetary value and 
thereby causing an unauthorised loss of property for another person, with the intention of procuring an 
unauthorised economic benefit for the person committing the offence or for a third party, by: 
— without right introducing, altering, deleting or suppressing computer data, in particular identification 
data, or 
— without right interfering with the functioning of a computer programme or system. 
 
In line with the prevailing opinion at that time and as a consequence of the lack of a mandate in the first 
pillar,  the  instrument  was  developed  under  the  third  pillar,  thereby  highlighting  that  in  view  of  the 
international dimension of the phenomena involved, such issues cannot be adequately addressed by the 
Member States themselves.  

European Union Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems (2005) 
After the publication of the general policy in 2001, the EC presented a proposal for a framework decision 
on  attacks  against  information  systems.1185 It  was  modified  and  adopted  by  the  Council  in  2005.1186 
Although  it  takes  note  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,1187 it  concentrates  on  the 
harmonization of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements. 
Aspects  of  criminal  procedural  law  (especially  the  harmonization  of  the  instruments  necessary  to 
investigate and prosecute cybercrime) and instruments related to the international cooperation were not 
integrated into the framework decision. It highlights the gaps and differences in the legal frameworks of 
the Member States and effective police and judicial cooperation in the area of attacks against information 
systems.1188  
 
Article 2 – Illegal access to information systems  
1.  Each  Member  State  shall  take  the  necessary  measures to  ensure that  the  intentional  access without 
right to the whole or any part of an information system is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for 
cases which are not minor.  
2. Each Member State may decide that the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 is incriminated only where 
the  offence  is  committed  by  infringing  a  security  measure.  punishable  by  effective,  proportional  and 
dissuasive criminal penalties. 
Article 3 – Illegal system interference  
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional serious hindering or 
interruption of the functioning of an information system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, 
deteriorating,  altering,  suppressing  or  rendering  inaccessible  computer  data  is  punishable  as  a  criminal 
offence when committed without right, at least for cases which are not minor.  
Article 4 – Illegal data interference  
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional deletion, damaging, 
deterioration,  alteration,  suppression  or  rendering  inaccessible  of  computer  data  on  an  information 
system is punishable as a criminal offence when committed without right, at least for cases which are not 
minor.

Data Retention Directive (2005) 
In 2005, the Council adopted the EU Data Retention Directive.1189 It contains an obligation for ISPs to store 
certain traffic data that are necessary for the identification of criminal offenders in cyberspace. 

 

Article 3 – Obligation to retain data  
1.  By  way  of  derogation  from  Articles  5,  6  and  9  of  Directive  2002/58/EC,  Member  States  shall  adopt 
measures to ensure that the data specified in Article 5 of this Directive are retained in accordance with the 
provisions  thereof,  to  the  extent  that  those  data  are  generated  or  processed  by  providers  of  publicly 
available  electronic  communications  services  or  of  a  public  communications  network  within  their 
jurisdiction in the process of supplying the communications services concerned.  
2.  The  obligation  to  retain  data  provided  for  in  paragraph  1  shall  include  the  retention  of  the  data 
specified in Article 5 relating to unsuccessful call attempts where those data are generated or processed, 
and  stored  (as  regards  telephony  data)  or  logged  (as  regards  Internet  data),  by  providers  of  publicly 
available electronic communications services or of a public communications network within the jurisdiction 
of the Member State concerned in the pro- cess of supplying the communication services concerned. This 
Directive shall not require data relating to unconnected calls to be retained.  

 

The fact that key information about any communication on the Internet will be covered by the Directive 
led to intensive criticism from human rights organizations and could lead to a review of the Directive and 
its implementation by constitutional courts.1190 In the conclusion of the case Productores de Música de 
España (Promusicae) v. Telefónica de España,1191 the adviser to the European Court of Justice, Advocate 
General Juliane Kokott, pointed out that it is questionable whether the data retention obligation can be 
implemented  without  a  violation  of  fundamental  rights. 1192  Potential  difficulties  concerning  the 
implementation of such regulations were already highlighted by the G8 in 2001.1193 
The Directive was based on the European Community’s mandate for the internal market (Article 95).1194 
The drafters highlighted that differing legal and technical standards related to the retention of data for 
the  purpose  of  investigating  cybercrime  present  obstacles  to  the  internal  market  for  electronic 
communications,  insofar  as  service  providers  face  different  requirements  entailing  different  financial 
investments.1195 Ireland, supported by Slovakia, asked the European Court of Justice to annul the Directive 
because it had not been adopted on an appropriate legal basis. Both countries argued that Article 95 was 
not a sufficient basis, since the focus of the instrument was not on the functioning of the internal market 
but rather the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime. The European Court of Justice dismissed 
the  action  as  unfounded,  pointing  out  that  differences  with  regard  to  obligations  to  retain  data  would 
have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market.1196 It furthermore highlighted that such a 
situation  justified  the  Community  legislature  in  pursuing  the  objective  of  safeguarding  the  proper 
functioning of the internal market through the adoption of harmonized rules. 

Amendment of the European Union Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2007) 
In  2007,  the  European  Union  started  discussion  on  a  draft  amendment  of  the  Framework  Decision  on 
combating terrorism.1197 In the introduction to the draft amendment, the EU highlights that the existing 
legal framework criminalizes aiding or abetting and inciting but does not criminalize the dissemination of 
terrorist expertise through the Internet.1198 With the amendment, the EU is aiming to take measures to 
close the gap and bring the legislation throughout the EU closer to the Council of Europe Convention on 
the Prevention of Terrorism.  
 
Article 3 – Offences linked to terrorist activities 
1. For the purposes of this Framework Decision: 
 

(a) “public provocation to commit a terrorist offence” means the distribution, or otherwise making 
available, of a message to the public, with the intent to incite the commission of one of the acts 
listed  in  Article  1(1)(a)  to  (h),  where  such  conduct,  whether  or  not  directly  advocating  terrorist 
offences, causes a danger that one or more such offences may be committed; 

132 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

 

(b) “recruitment for terrorism” means to solicit another person to commit one of the acts listed in 
Article 1(1), or in Article 2(2); 
(c) “training for terrorism” means to provide instruction in the making or use of explosives, firearms 
or other weapons or noxious or hazardous substances, or in other specific methods or techniques, 
for the purpose of committing one of the acts listed in Article 1(1), knowing that the skills provided 
are intended to be used for this purpose. 

2. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that terrorist-linked offences include 
the following intentional acts: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(a) public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; 
(b) recruitment for terrorism; 
(c) training for terrorism; 
(d) aggravated theft with a view to committing one of the acts listed in Article 1(1); 
(e) extortion with a view to the perpetration of one of the acts listed in Article 1(1); 
(f) drawing up false administrative documents with a view to committing one of the acts listed in 
Article 1(1)(a) to (h) and Article 2(2)(b). 

3. For an act to be punishable as set forth in paragraph 2, it shall not be necessary that a terrorist offence 
be actually committed.” 
 
Based  on  Article 3(1)(c)1199 of  the  Framework  Decision,  the  Member States  are,  for example,  obliged  to 
criminalize  the  publication  of  instructions  on  how  to  use  explosives,  knowing  that  this  information  is 
intended to be used for terrorist-related purposes. The need for evidence that the information is intended 
to be used for terrorist-related purposes very likely limits the application of the provision with regard to 
the majority of instructions on how to use weapons that are available online, as their publication does not 
directly  link  them  to  terrorist  attacks.  As  most  of  the  weapons  and  explosives  can  be  used  to  commit 
“regular” crimes as well as terrorist-related offences (dual use), the information itself can hardly be used 
to  prove  that  the  person who  published  them  had  knowledge  about  the  way  such  information  is  used 
afterwards.  Therefore  the  context  of  the  publication  (e.g. on  a  website  operated  by  a  terrorist 
organization) needs to be taken into consideration.  

Directive on child pornography  
The first cybercrime-related draft legal framework presented after the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon 
was the proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and 
child pornography1200 that was adopted in 2011.1201 The drafters pointed out that information technology 
enables  offenders  to  produce  and  distribute  child  pornography  more  easily1202 and  emphasizes  the 
importance  of  addressing  the  resulting  challenges  with  specific  provisions.  It  implements  international 
standards,  such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  against  Sexual 
Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.1203  
 
Article 5 – Offences concerning child pornography  
1.  Member  States  shall  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  the  intentional  conduct,  when 
committed without right, referred to in paragraphs 2 to 6 is punishable.  
2. Acquisition or possession of child pornography shall be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment 
of at least 1 year.  
3.  Knowingly  obtaining  access,  by  means  of  information  and  communication  technology,  to  child 
pornography shall be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 1 year.  
4.  Distribution,  dissemination  or  transmission  of  child  pornography  shall  be  punishable  by  a  maximum 
term of imprisonment of at least 2 years.  
5. Offering, supplying or making available child pornography shall be punishable by a maximum term of 
imprisonment of at least 2 years.  
6. Production of child pornography shall be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 3 
years.

7.  It  shall  be  within  the  discretion  of  Member  States  to  decide  whether  this  Article  applies  to  cases 
involving child pornography as referred to in Article 2(c)(iii), where the person appearing to be a child was 
in fact 18 years of age or older at the time of depiction.  
8. It shall be within the discretion of Member States to decide whether paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Article 
apply  to  cases  where  it  is  established  that  pornographic  material  as  referred  to  in  Article  2(c)(iv)  is 
produced  and  possessed  by  the  producer  solely  for  his  or  her  private  use  in  so  far  as  no  pornographic 
material  as  referred  to  in Article  2(c)(i),  (ii)  or  (iii)  has  been  used  for  the  purpose  of  its  production  and 
provided that the act involves no risk of dissemination of the material.  

 
Like the Convention, the Directive proposes the criminalization of obtaining access to child pornography 
by  means  of  information  and  communication  technology.1204 This  enables  law-enforcement  agencies  to 
prosecute offenders in cases where they are able to prove that the offender opened websites with child 
pornography,  but  are  unable  to  prove  that  the  offender  downloaded  material.  Such  difficulties  in 
collecting  evidence  arise,  for  example,  if  the  offender  is  using  encryption  technology  to  protect 
downloaded files on his storage media.1205 The Explanatory Report to the Convention on the Protection of 
Children points out that the provision should also be applicable in cases where the offender only views 
child  pornography  pictures  online  without  downloading  them.1206 In  general,  opening  a  website  does 
automatically  initiate  a  download  process  –  often  without  the  knowledge  of  the  user. 1207 As  a 
consequence, the provision is mainly relevant in cases where consumption of child pornography can take 
place without download of material. This can, for example, be the case if the website enables streaming 
videos  and,  due  to  the  technical  configuration  of  the  streaming  process,  does  not  buffer  the  received 
information but discards it straight after transmission.1208  
 
Article 25 – Measures against websites containing or disseminating child pornography  
1.  Member  States  shall  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  the  prompt  removal  of  web  pages 
containing  or  disseminating  child  pornography  hosted  in  their  territory  and  to endeavour to obtain  the 
removal of such pages hosted outside of their territory.  
2.  Member  States  may  take  measures  to  block  access  to  web  pages  containing  or  disseminating  child 
pornography towards the Internet users within their territory. These measures must be set by transparent 
procedures and provide adequate safeguards, in particular to ensure that the restriction is limited to what 
is  necessary  and  proportionate,  and  that  users  are  informed  of  the  reason  for  the  restriction.  Those 
safeguards shall also include the possibility of judicial redress.  

In  addition  to  the  criminalization  of  acts  related  to  child  pornography,  the  initiation  draft  contained  a 
provision  that  obliges  Member  States  to  implement  the  process  of  blocking  websites  containing  child 
pornography.1209 Several  European  countries,1210 as  well  as  non-European  countries  like  China,1211 Iran1212 
and Thailand,1213 use such an approach. Concerns relate to the fact that none of the technical concepts 
has  proven  to  be  effective,1214 and  the  approach  entails  a  concomitant  risk  of  over-blocking.1215 As  a 
consequence the mandatory blocking was changed and it was left to Member States to decide if blocking 
obligations should be implemented on the national level.  

Draft Directive on attacks against information systems (not adopted by end of 2011) 
In  September  2010,  the  European  Union  presented  a  proposal  for  a  Directive  on  attacks  against 
information systems.1216 As described in more detail above, the EU adopted a Council Framework Decision 
on  attacks  against  information  systems  in  2005.1217 The  Explanatory  Memorandum  to  the  proposal 
highlights that the intention of the drafters was to update and strengthen the legal framework to fight 
cybercrime in the European Union by responding to new methods of committing crimes.1218 In addition to 
the  criminalization  of  illegal  access  (Article 3),  illegal  system  interference  (Article 4)  and  illegal  data 
interference  (Article 5)  already  introduced  by  the  2005  Framework  Decision,  the  2010  draft  Directive 
contains two additional offences.  
 

134 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Draft Article 6 – Illegal interception 
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional interception by technical 
means, of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a information system, including 
electromagnetic emissions from an information system carrying such computer data, is punishable as a 
criminal offence when committed without right. 
Draft Article 7 – Tools used for committing offences 
Member States shall take the necessary measure to ensure that the production, sale, procurement for use, 
import, possession, distribution or otherwise making available of the following is punishable as a criminal 
offence when committed intentionally and without right for the purpose of committing any of the offences 
referred to in Articles 3 to 6: 
(a) device, including a computer program, designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of committing 
any of the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 6; 
(b) a computer password, access code, or similar data by which the whole or any part of an information 
system is capable of being accessed. 
 
Both provisions are largely in line with the corresponding provisions in the Convention on Cybercrime.  

Relationship with the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
As pointed out above, the  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime was negotiated between 1997 
and 2000. In 1999, the European Union expressed its perspective on the Convention on Cybercrime in a 
common position.1219 It called for Member States to support the drawing up of the Council of Europe’s 
draft Convention on Cybercrime.1220 At that time, the EU itself had no mandate to develop a similar legal 
framework. The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty changed the situation. However, the EU has so far not 
decided  to  change  its  position  with  regard  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime.  In  the  Stockholm 
Programme,  it  highlighted  that  the  EU  not  only  calls  upon  Member  States  to  ratify  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime, but also states that, in the view of the EU, it should become the legal framework of reference 
for fighting cybercrime at global level.1221 However, this does not imply that the EU will not come up with a 
comprehensive  approach  to  cybercrime,  since  EU  approaches  offer  two  major  advantages.  First,  EU 
directives have to be implemented within a short, specified time-frame, whereas the Council of Europe 
has no means of enforcing the signature and ratification of conventions apart from political pressure.1222 
Secondly,  the  EU  has  a  practice  of  constantly  updating  its  instruments,  whereas  the  Council  of  Europe 
Convention on Cybercrime has not been updated in the last ten years.  

5.2.3  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development1223 
In 1983, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) initiated a study on the 
possibility  of  international harmonization  of  criminal  law  in  order  to  address  the  problem  of  computer 
crime.1224 In 1985, it published a report that analysed the current legislation and made proposals for the 
fight against cybercrime.1225 It recommended a minimum list of offences that countries should consider 
criminalizing, e.g. computer-related fraud, computer-related forgery, the alteration of computer programs 
and  data,  and  the  interception  of  the  communications.  In  1990,  the  Information,  Computer  and 
Communications  Policy  (ICCP)  Committee  created  an  Expert  Group  to  develop  a  set  of  guidelines  for 
information  security,  which  was  drafted  by  1992  and  then  adopted  by  the  OECD  Council.1226 The 
guidelines include, among other aspects, the issues of sanctions:  
 

 

135 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Sanctions for misuse of information systems are an important means in the protection of the interests of 
those relying on information systems from harm resulting from attacks to the availability, confidentiality 
and integrity of information systems and their components. Examples of such attacks include damaging or 
disrupting information systems by inserting viruses and worms, alteration of data, illegal access to data, 
computer  fraud  or  forgery,  and  unauthorised  reproduction  of  computer  programs.  In  combating  such 
dangers, countries have chosen to describe and respond to the offending acts in a variety of ways. There is 
growing  international  agreement  on  the  core  of  computer-related  offences  that  should  be  covered  by 
national penal laws. This is reflected in the development of computer crime and data protection legislation 
in  OECD  Member  countries  during  the  last  two  decades  and  in  the  work  of  the  OECD  and  other 
international bodies on legislation to combat computer-related crime […]. National legislation should be 
reviewed  periodically  to  ensure  that  it  adequately  meets  the  dangers  arising  from  the  misuse  of 
information systems. 
 
After reviewing the guidelines in 1997, the ICCP created a second Expert Group in 2001 that updated the 
guidelines.  In  2002,  a  new  version  of  the  guidelines  “OECD  Guidelines  for  the  Security  of  Information 
Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security” was adopted as a Recommendation of the OECD 
Council.1227 The guidelines contain nine complementary principles:  
 
1) Awareness  
Participants should be aware of the need for security of information systems and networks and what they 
can do to enhance security.  
2) Responsibility  
All participants are responsible for the security of information systems and networks.  
3) Response  
Participants should act in a timely and co-operative  manner to prevent, detect and respond to security 
incidents.  
4) Ethics  
Participants should respect the legitimate interests of others.  
5) Democracy  
The  security  of  information  systems  and  networks  should  be  compatible  with  essential  values  of  a 
democratic society.  
6) Risk assessment  
Participants should conduct risk assessments.  
7) Security design and implementation  
Participants should incorporate security as an essential element of information systems and networks.  
8) Security management  
Participants should adopt a comprehensive approach to security management.  
9) Reassessment  
Participants  should  review  and  reassess  the  security  of  information  systems  and  networks,  and  make 
appropriate modifications to security policies, practices, measures and procedures.  

In  2005,  OECD  published  a  report  that  analysed  the  impact  of  spam  on  developing  countries.1228 The 
report  showed  that,  on  account  of  their  more  limited  and  more  expensive  resources,  spam  is  a  much 
more  serious  issue  in  developing  countries  than  in  developed  countries  such  as  the  OECD  Member 
States.1229 After  receiving  a  request  from  the  Strategic  Planning  Unit  of  the  Executive  Office  of  the 
Secretary  General  of  the  United  Nations  to  produce  a  comparative  outline  of  domestic  legislative 
solutions regarding the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, in 2007 OECD published a report on the 
legislative treatment of “cyberterror” in the domestic law of individual states.1230 In 2008, OECD published 
a  Scoping  Paper  on  online  identity  theft.1231 The  paper  provides  an  overview  of  the  characteristics  of 
identity  theft,  the  different  forms  of  identity  theft,  victim-related  issues  as  well  as  law-enforcement 
schemes.  The  paper  highlights  that  most  OECD  countries  do  not  address  the  issue  per  se  by  means  of 
specific provisions, and that the question whether ID theft should be criminalized as a standalone offence 
needs  to  be  considered.1232 In  2009,  OECD  published  a  report  on  malicious  software.1233 Although  the 

136 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
report briefly addresses aspects of criminalization, the focus is on the scope of malware and its economic 
impact.  

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation1234 

5.2.4 
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has identified cybercrime as an important field of activity, 
and  APEC  leaders  have  called  for  closer  cooperation  among  officials  involved  in  the  fight  against 
cybercrime.1235 The  Declaration  of  the  2008  meeting  of  the  APEC  Telecommunication  and  Information 
Ministers  in  Bangkok,  Thailand,  highlighted  the  importance  of  continuing  collaboration  to  combat 
cybercrime.1236 Until now, APEC has not provided a legal framework on cybercrime, but has referred to 
international  standards  such  as  the  Budapest  Convention  on  Cybercrime.  In  addition,  APEC  has  closely 
studied the national cybercrime legislation in various countries1237 under a cybercrime legislation survey, 
and  has  developed  a  database  of  approaches  to  assist  economies  in  developing  and  reviewing 
legislation.1238 The questionnaire used for the survey was based on the legal framework provided by the 
Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.  

Statement on fighting terrorism (2002)  
In  2002,  APEC  leaders  released  a  Statement  on  Fighting  Terrorism  and  Promoting  Growth  to  enact 
comprehensive laws relating to cybercrime and develop national cybercrime investigating capabilities.1239 
They  committed  to  endeavouring  to  enact  a  comprehensive  set  of  laws  relating  to  cybersecurity  and 
cybercrime  that  are  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  international  legal  instruments,  including  United 
Nations  General  Assembly  Resolution  55/63  and  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  by 
October 2003. In addition, they committed to identifying national cybercrime units and international high-
technology assistance points of contact and creating such capabilities, to the extent they do not already 
exist,  by  October  2003,  and  establishing  institutions  that  exchange  threat  and  vulnerability  assessment 
(such as computer emergency response teams), by October 2003. 

Conference on cybercrime legislation (2005) 
APEC has organized various conferences1240 and called for closer cooperation among officials involved in 
the fight against cybercrime.1241 In 2005, APEC organized a Conference on Cybercrime Legislation. 1242 The 
primary  objectives  of  the  conference  were  to  promote  the  development  of  comprehensive  legal 
frameworks  to  combat  cybercrime  and  promote  cybersecurity;  assist  law-enforcement  authorities  to 
respond to cutting-edge issues and the challenges raised by advances in technology; promote cooperation 
between cybercrime investigators across the region.  

Telecommunications and Information Working Group 
The  APEC  Telecommunications  and  Information  Working  Group 1243 actively  participated  in  APEC’s 
approaches  to  increase  cybersecurity.1244 In  2002,  it  adopted  the  APEC  Cybersecurity  Strategy.1245 The 
Working  Group  expressed  their  position  regarding  cybercrime  legislation  by  referring  to  existing 
international approaches from the UN and the Council of Europe.1246 Experiences with drafting cybercrime 
legislation were discussed within the context of the e-Security Task Group of the Telecommunications and 
Information Working Group during two conferences1247 in Thailand in 2003.1248  

The Commonwealth 

5.2.5 
Cybercrime is among the issues addressed by the Commonwealth. The activities concentrate in particular 
on  harmonization  of  legislation.  This  approach  to  harmonize  legislation  within  the  Commonwealth  and 
enable international cooperation was influenced, among other things, by the fact that, without such an 
approach, it would require no fewer than 1 272 bilateral treaties within the Commonwealth to deal with 
international cooperation in this matter.1249 
Taking  into  account  the  rising  importance  of  cybercrime,  the  Law  Ministers  of  the  Commonwealth 
decided to order an expert group to develop a legal framework for combating cybercrime on the basis of 
the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1250 The  Expert  Group  presented  its  report  and 

 

137 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
recommendations  in  March 2002.1251 Later  in  2002,  the  draft  Model  Law  on  Computer  and  Computer 
Related Crime was presented.1252 Due to the clear instruction as well as the recognition of the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime as an international standard by the expert group, the model law largely 
corresponds  to  the  standards  defined  by  that  Convention.  However,  there  are  differences  that  will  be 
discussed further in Chapter 6.  
At  the  2000  meeting,  the  Law  Ministers  and  Attorney-Generals  of  small  Commonwealth  jurisdictions 
decided to set up an expert group to develop model legislation on digital evidence. The model law was 
presented in 2002.1253 
In  addition  to  providing  legislation,  the  Commonwealth  has  organized  several  training  activities.  The 
Commonwealth  Network  of  IT  and  Development  (COMNET-IT)  co-organized  training  on  cybercrime  in 
April 2007. 
In 2009, the Commonwealth Third Country Training Programme on legal framework for ICT was held in 
Malta, with the support of the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC). Another training 
was organized in 2011. 
In 2011 the Commonwealth presented “The Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative”. The main objective of 
the  initiative  is  to  assist  Commonwealth  countries  in  building  their  institutional,  human  and  technical 
capacities  with  respect  to  policy,  legislation,  regulation,  investigation  and  law  enforcement.1254 It  aims 
to enable all Commonwealth countries to effectively cooperate in the global combat of cybercrime. 

African Union  

5.2.6 
During  the  extra-ordinary  conference  of  the  African  Union  Ministers  in  charge  of  Communcation  and 
Information Technologies, which was held in Johannesburg in 2009, the minsters addressed various topics 
related to the increasing use of ICT in the African country. It was decided that African Union Commission 
should  –  jointly  with  the  UN  Economic  Commission  for  Africa  –  develop  a  legal  framework  for  African 
countries that addresses issues like electronic transactions, cyber security and data protection.1255  
In  2011  the  African  Union  presented  the  Draft  African  Union  Convention  on  the  Establishment  of  a 
Credible  Legal  Framework  for  Cyber  Security  in  Africa.1256 The  intention  of  the  drafters  is  to  strengthen 
existing  legislation  in  Member  States  regarding  Information  and  Communication  Technologies.  With 
regard to the mandate, that was not limited to cybercrime, but also included other information society 
issues such as data protection and electronic transactions- The Convention is more comprehensive than 
most  other  regional  approaches.  It  contains  four  parts.  Part  one  is  related  to  electronic  commerce.  It 
addresses  various  aspects  such  as  contractual  responsibility  of  an  electronic  provider  of  goods  and 
services1257, treaty obligations in electronic form1258 and security of electronic transactions.1259 The second 
part  deals  with  data  protection  issues.1260 The  third  part  is  related  to  combating  cybercrime.  Section  1 
contains five chapters. This includes a set of six definitions (electronic communication, computerized data, 
racism and xenophobia in ICTs, minor, child pornography and computer system).1261  
 
Article III – 1: 
For the purpose of this Convention: 
1) Electronic communication means any transmission to the public or a section of the public by electronic 
or  magnetic  means  of  communication,  signs,  signals,  written  matter,  pictures,  sounds  or  messages  of 
whatsoever nature;  
2) Computerized data means any representation of facts, information or concepts in any form that lends 
itself to computer processing;  
3) Racism and xenophobia in ICTs means any written matter, picture or any other representation of ideas 
or theories which advocates or encourages hatred, discrimination or violence against a person or group of 
persons for reasons of race, color, ancestry or national or ethnic origin or religion, where these serve as 
pretext for either racism and xenophobia or as motivation thereof;  
4) Minor means any person aged less than eighteen (18) years in terms of the United Nations Convention 
on the Rights of the Child;  

138 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
5) Child pornography means any data, regardless of the nature or form, which visually represents a minor 
lending him/herself to explicit sexual act, or realistic images representing a minor lending himself/herself 
to explicit sexual behavior;  
6) Computer system means any device, be it isolated or otherwise, and a range of interconnected devices 
used in part or in whole for automated processing of data for the purpose of executing a programme.  

In addition the third part addresses the need of a national cybersecurity policy and a related strategy.1262 
The second chapter deals with general aspects related to legal measures. This includes standards related 
to  statuatory  authorities,  democratic  principles,  protection  of  essential  information  infrastructure, 
harmonization,  double  criminality  and  international  cooperation.1263 The  third  chapter  addresses  issues 
related to a national cyber security system. This includes a culture of security, the role of the government, 
public-private partnership, education and training and public awareness-raising.1264 Chapter 4 is dedicated 
to national cyber security monitoring structures. The fifth chapter deals with international cooperation. 
The  main  difference  to  comparable  regional  frameworks  such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime is the fact that the Draft African Union Convention– if no other instrument for international 
cooperation  is  in  place  –  cannot  be  used  for  such  purpose.  The  different  conception  is  especially 
expressed by Articles 21 and 25.  
 
Article III – 1 – 21: International cooperation 
Each Member State shall adopt such measures as it deems necessary to foster exchange of information 
and  the  sharing  of  quick,  expeditious  and  reciprocal  data  by  Member  States’  organizations  and  similar 
organizations of other Member States with responsibility to cause the law to be applied in the territory on 
bilateral or multilateral basis. 

 
Article III – 1 – 25: Model of international cooperation 
Each  Member  State  shall  adopt  such  measures  and  strategies  as  it  deems  necessary  to  participate  in 
regional  and  international  cooperation  in  cyber  security.  The  Resolutions  geared to  promoting Member 
States’  participation  within  this  framework  of  relations  have  been  adopted  by  a  large  number  of 
international governmental bodies including the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union, 
the  G8,  etc.  Organizations  like  the  International  Telecommunication  Union,  the  Council  of  Europe,  the 
Commonwealth of Nations and others, have established model frameworks for international cooperation 
which Member States may adopt as a guide. 

Section II of the third part deals with substantive penal law. Section 1 includes a criminalization of illegal 
access to a computer system1265, illegal remaining in a computer system1266, illegal system interference1267, 
illegal data input1268, illegal data interception1269 and illegal data interference.1270 The provisions show a lot 
of similarities with best practices from other regions – including standards introduced within Africa. One 
example is the criminalization of illegal remaining in a computer system that was introduced by the Draft 
ECOWAS Directive.1271 
 
Article III – 3: 
Each Member State of the African Unions shall take the legislative measures required to set up as a penal 
offense the fact of retaining oneself or attempting to retain oneself fraudulently in a part or the whole of a 
computer system. 

One new concept – however, not criminal law provision but a side measure – that was in this regard not 
introduced by other regional frameworks is the introduction of an obligation of businesses to to submit 
their products fro vulnerability testing.  

 

 

139 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Article III-7: 
[...] 
2) The Member States shall adopt rules to compel ICT product vendors to submit their products for 
vulnerability and guarantee tests to be conducted by independent experts and to divulge to the public any 
form of vulnerability found in the said products and the measures recommended for a solution thereto.  

Section  2  includes  the  criminalization  of  aspects  of  computer-related  forgery1272,  illegal  use  of  data1273, 
illegal system interference with the intent to obtain an advantage1274, data protection violations1275, illegal 
devices1276 and participation in a criminal organization.1277 
 
Article III – 9: 
Each Member State of the African Union shall take the legislative measures required to set up as a penal 
offense the fact of using the data obtained with a full knowledge of a case. 

Especially the criminalization of an illegal use of computer data is going beyond the standards defined by 
most other regional instruments.  
Section  3  deals  with  the  criminalization  of  illegal  content.  The  Draft  African  Convention  introduces  a 
criminalization  of  producing  and  disseminating  child  pornography1278,  procuring  and  importing  child 
pornography1279,  possessing  child  pornography1280,  facilitating  the  access  of  minors  to  pornography1281, 
dissemination  of  racist  or  xenophobic  material 1282 ,  racist  attacks  perpetrated  through  computer 
systems1283 ,  racist  abuse  through  computer  systems1284 and  denying  or  approving  genocide  or  crimes 
against humanity.1285 
The last section of Chapter 1 contains provisions that deal in a broader manner with legislation related to 
Cybercrime and the admissibility of electronic evidence (“written electronic matter”). 
 
Article III – 23 – 1: Laws against cyber crime 
Each Member State shall adopt such legislative measures as it deems effective, to define material criminal 
offenses as acts which affect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and survivability of ICT systems and 
related  infrastructure  networks;  as  well  as  procedural  measures  deemed  effective  for  the  arrest  and 
prosecution  of  offenders.  Member  States  shall  be  called  upon  to  take  on  board,  where  necessary,  the 
approved  language  choice  in  international  cyber  crime  legislation  models  such  as  the  language  choice 
adopted by the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations. 
 
Article III – 23 – 2: 
Each Member State of the African Union shall take the legislative measures required to ensure that written 
electronic matter in respect of criminal matters are admissible to establish offenses under criminal law, 
provided such written matter has been presented during debate and discussed before the judge, that the 
person from which the written material emanates can be duly identified and the said material has been 
prepared and conserved under conditions likely to guarantee their integrity. 

 

Especially with regard to Article III-23-1 the intention of the drafters is not fully accessible as the crimes 
contained in previous parts of Chapter 1 define crimes as crimes against the integrity and availability of 
computer systems. It is therefore uncertain how far Article III-23-1– with regard to the criminalization – 
requires  countries  to  go  beyond  the  crimes  already  established  in  more  detail  by  the  Draft  African 
Convention.  
Chapter  two  contains  provisions  that  intend  to  update  traditional  provisions  to  ensure  an  applicability 
when  it  comes  to  the  involvement  of  computer  systems  and  data.  It  requires  countries  to  set  up  an 
aggravation  of  penalty  if  traditional  crimes  are  committed  by  using  information  and  communication 
technology1286,  the  criminalization  violation  of  property  by  offences  such  as  theft,  abuse  of  trust  or 

140 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
blackmail  involving  computer  data1287,  update  provisions  that  include  dissemination  facilities  to  ensure 
that the use of means of digital electronic communication is covered1288 and ensure that provisions that 
protect secrecy in the interest of national security are applicable with regard to computer data.1289 Such 
provisions are not included in other regional frameworks. With regard to Article III-24 it is uncertain why 
the  mere  fact  that  a  computer  system  was  used  at  one  stage  during  the  commission  of  a  traditional 
offence (eg. the offenders send an email prior to breaking into a bank instead of making a phone call) shall 
lead to an aggravated sentence.  
 
Article III – 24: 
Each  Member  State  of  the  African  Union  shall  take  the  legislative  measures  required  to  set  up  as  an 
aggravating circumstance the use of ICT to commit common law offenses such as theft, fraud, possession 
of stolen goods, abuse of trust, extortion of money, terrorism, money laundering, etc. 

Article III-28 – Article III- 35 deal with liability and sanctions.  
Section III deals with procedural law. It requires that Member States enable the conservation of computer 
data 1290 ,  the  seizure  of  computer  data 1291 ,  expedited  preservation 1292  and 
interception  of  data 
communication.1293 

Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council1294 

5.2.7 
A  number  of  countries  in  the  Arabic  region  have  already  undertaken  national  measures  and  adopted 
approaches  to  combat  cybercrime,  or  are  in  the  process  of  drafting  legislation.1295 Examples  of  such 
countries  include  Pakistan,1296 Egypt1297 and  the  United  Arabic  Emirates  (UAE).1298 In  order  to  harmonize 
legislation  in  the  region,  UAE  submitted  model  legislation  to  the  Arab  League  (Guiding  Law  to  Fight  IT 
Crime).1299 In 2003, the Arab Interior Ministers Council and the Arab Justice Ministers Council adopted the 
law.1300 The  Gulf  Cooperation  Council  (GCC)1301 recommended  at  a  conference  in  2007  that  the  GCC 
countries seek a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards.1302  

5.2.8  Organization of American States1303 
Since  1999,  the  Organization  of  American  States  (OAS)  has  actively  been  addressing  the  issue  of 
cybercrime within the region. Among others, the organization has held a number of meetings within the 
mandate  and  scope  of  REMJA,  the  Ministers  of  Justice  or  Ministers  or  Attorneys  General  of  the 
Americas.1304  

Intergovernmental expert group on cybercrime 
In 1999, REMJA recommended the establishment of an intergovernmental expert group on cybercrime. 
The expert group was mandated to complete a diagnosis of criminal activity which targets computers and 
information, or which uses computers as the means of committing an offence; complete a diagnosis of 
national  legislation,  policies  and  practices  regarding  such  activity;  identify  national  and  international 
entities with relevant expertise; and finally identify mechanisms of cooperation within the inter-American 
system to combat cybercrime. 

Recommendations of the Ministers of Justice 
REMJA has held eight meetings until 2010.1305 At the third meeting, in 2000, the Ministers of Justice or 
Ministers  or  Attorneys  General  of  the  Americas  addressed  the  topic  of  cybercrime  and  agreed  on  a 
number  of  recommendations.1306 These  recommendations  included  to  support  consideration  of  the 
recommendations  made  by  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts  at  its  initial  meeting  as  the  REMJA 
contribution  to  the  development  of  the  Inter-American  Strategy  to  Combat  Threats  to  Cybersecurity, 
referred  to  in  OAS  General  Assembly  Resolution  AG/RES.  1939  /XXXIII-O/03),  and  to  ask  the  group, 
through  its  chair,  to  continue  to  support  the  preparation  of  the  strategy.  The  meeting  further 
recommended  that  Member  States  should  review  mechanisms  to  facilitate  broad  and  efficient 
cooperation  among  themselves  to  combat  cybercrime  and  study,  where  possible,  the  development  of 

 

141 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
technical  and  legal  capacity  to  join  the  24/7  Network  established  by  the  G8  to  assist  in  cybercrime 
investigations. Member States were asked to evaluate the advisability of implementing the principles of 
the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  and  consider  the  possibility  of  acceding  to  that 
Convention. In addition to the United States and Canada, which signed the Convention on Cybercrime in 
2001, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Mexico have in the meantime been invited by the Council 
of Europe to accede to the Convention. Finally, the recommendations called for OAS Member States to 
review and, if appropriate, update the structure and work of domestic bodies, or agencies in charge of 
enforcing  the  laws  so  as  to  adapt  to  the  shifting  nature  of  cybercrime,  including  by  reviewing  the 
relationship  between  agencies  that  combat  cybercrime  and  those  that  provide  traditional  police  or 
mutual legal assistance. 
The  fourth  meeting  of  Ministers  of  Justice  or  Ministers  or  Attorneys  General  of  the  Americas  in  2002 
recommended  that,  in  the  framework  of  the  activities  of  the  OAS  working  group  to  follow  up  on  the 
REMJA  recommendations,  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts1307 on  cybercrime  be  reconvened  and 
mandated to follow up on implementation of the recommendations prepared by that group and adopted 
by  REMJA-III,  and  consider  the  preparation  of  pertinent  inter-American  legal  instruments  and  model 
legislation  for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  hemispheric  cooperation  in  combating  cybercrime  and 
considering  standards  relating  to  privacy,  the  protection  of  information,  procedural  aspects,  and  crime 
prevention. 
The  recommendations  of  the  sixth  meeting  of  Ministers  of  Justice1308 included  a  call  to  continue  to 
strengthen cooperation with the Council of Europe so that the OAS Member States can give consideration 
to applying the principles of the Convention on Cybercrime1309 and to adhering thereto, and to adopting 
the legal and other measures required for its implementation. Similarly, the meeting recommended that 
efforts  should  continue  to  strengthen  mechanisms  for  exchange  of  information  and  cooperation  with 
other international organizations and agencies in the area of cybercrime, such as the UN, the EU, APEC, 
OECD, the G8, the Commonwealth and Interpol, in order for the OAS Member States to take advantage of 
progress  in  those  forums.  Furthermore,  Member  States  were  asked  to  establish  specialized  units  to 
investigate cybercrime, identify the authorities who will serve as the points of contact in this matter and 
expedite the exchange of information and obtaining of evidence, and in addition, to foster cooperation in 
efforts  to  combat  cybercrime  among  government  authorities  and  Internet  service  providers  and  other 
private-sector enterprises providing data transmission services. 
These  recommendations  were  reiterated  at  the  2008  meeting,1310 which  further  recommended  that, 
bearing  in  mind  the  recommendations  adopted  by  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts  and  by  the 
previous  REMJA  meetings,  the  states  consider  applying  the  principles  of  the  Council  of  Europe’s 
Convention on Cybercrime, acceding thereto, and adopting the legal and other measures required for its 
implementation. Similarly, the meeting recommended that technical cooperation activities continue to be 
held under the auspices of the OAS General Secretariat, through the Secretariat for Legal Affairs, and the 
Council of Europe, and that efforts be continued to strengthen exchange of information and cooperation 
with other international organizations and agencies in the area of cybercrime, so that the OAS Member 
States  may  take  advantage  of  progress  in  those  forums.  Finally,  the  secretariats  of  the  Inter-American 
Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) and the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) and 
the Working Group on Cybercrime were requested to continue developing permanent coordination and 
cooperation  actions  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  Comprehensive  Inter-American  Cybersecurity 
Strategy adopted through OAS General Assembly Resolution AG/RES. 2004 (XXXIV-O/04).  
In 2010, REMJA addressed the issue of cybercrime at their eighth meeting.1311 They briefly discussed the 
importance  of  continuing  to  consolidate  and  update  the  Inter-American  Portal  for  Cooperation  in 
Cybercrime through the OAS Internet page, and strengthening states’ capacity to develop legislation and 
procedural  measures  related  to  cybercrime  and  electronic  evidence.  In  addition,  the  meeting’s 
recommendations  highlighted  the  desire  to  strengthen  mechanisms  that  allow  for  the  exchange  of 
information  and  cooperation  with  other  international  organizations  and  agencies  in  the  area  of 
cybercrime, such as the Council of Europe, the UN, the EU, APEC, OECD, the G8, the Commonwealth and 
Interpol, so that OAS Member States can take advantage of developments in those entities.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

in  at 

Caribbean  

 
5.2.9 
In  December 2008,  ITU  and  the  EU  launched  the  project  “Enhancing  Competitiveness  in  the  Caribbean 
through the Harmonization of ICT Policies, Legislation and Regulatory Procedures” (HIPCAR) to promote 
the ICT sector in the Caribbean region.1312 The project forms part of the programme “ACP-Information and 
Communication Technologies” and the ninth European Development Fund. Beneficiary countries are 15 
Caribbean countries.1313 The aim of the project is to assist CARIFORUM1314 countries to harmonize their ICT 
policies and legal frameworks.  
Under this project, nine work areas have been identified1315 in which model policies and model legislative 
texts  were  developed  to  facilitate  the  development  and  harmonization  of  legislation  in  the  region. 
Cybercrime was one of the nine work areas. The development of the model legislative text took place in 
three  phases.  In  the  first  phase,  existing  legislation  in  the  beneficiary  countries  was  collected  and 
reviewed.  In  parallel,  regional  and  international  best  practices  were  identified.  Priority  was  given  to 
standards  that  are  directly  applicable 
least  some  of  the  beneficiary  countries  (e.g. the 
Commonwealth  Model  Law  from  2002).  However,  the  review  also  included  best  practices  from  other 
regions,  such  as  the  EU  and  Africa.  The  assessment  report1316 contained  an  overview  of  the  existing 
legislation, as well as a comparative law analysis that compared the existing legislation with regional and 
international  best  practices.  In  order  to  prepare  a  gap  analysis,  the  assessment  report  in  addition 
identified special needs in the region (such as legislation on spam) that are not necessarily addressed by 
international  best  practices.  In  a  workshop  in  2010,  the  assessment  report  was  discussed  with 
stakeholders from the beneficiary countries.1317 On the basis of the assessment report and gap analysis, 
the stakeholders drafted model policy guidelines.  
In the second phase, a model legislative text was developed taking into account the policy guidelines. At a 
second  workshop,  policy  experts,  law  drafters  and  other  stakeholders  from  the  beneficiary  countries 
discussed and amended the draft model legislative text that was prepared for the meeting, and adopted 
it. The model legislative text has three key aims: it provides specific sample language that is in line with 
international best practices, it reflects the special demands of the region and it is developed with law-
drafting practices in the region in mind, so as to ensure smooth implementation. The model legislative 
text contains a complex set of definitions, and substantive criminal law provisions, including provisions 
dealing with issues like SPAM that have a high priority for the region but are not necessarily contained in 
regional frameworks such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  
 
15. (1) A person who, intentionally without lawful excuse or justification:  
 

a) intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple electronic mail messages from or through such 
computer system; or 
b) uses a protected computer system to relay or retransmit multiple electronic mail messages, with 
the intent to deceive or mislead users, or any electronic mail or Internet service provider, as to the 
origin of such messages, or 
c)  materially  falsifies  header  information  in  multiple  electronic  mail  messages  and  intentionally 
initiates the transmission of such messages, 
commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], 
or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 

 

 

 

(2)  A  country  may  restrict  the  criminalization  with  regard  to  the  transmission  of  multiple  electronic 
messages within customer or business relationships. A country may decide not to criminalize the conduct 
in section 15 (1) (a) provided that other effective remedies are available. 
 
Furthermore, the text contains procedural law provisions (including advanced investigation instruments 
such as the use of remote forensic tools) and provisions on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs). 

5.2.10  Pacific 
In  parallel  to  the  ITU  and  EU  co-funded  project  in  the  Caribbean  the  same  organizations  launched  a 
project  in  the  Pacific  (ICB4PAC).1318 The  project  aims  –  based  on  a  request  by  the  the  Pacific  Island 

 

143 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
countries – to provide capacity building related to ICT policies and regulations. In this regard it focuses on 
building human and institutional capacity in the field of ICT through training, education and knowledge 
sharing  measures.  Beneficiary  countries  are  15  Pacific  Island  countries.1319 In  March  2011  a  workshop 
dealing with the current cybercrime legislation in the Pacific region was hosted in Vanuatu.1320 During the 
workshop a comprehensive comparative legal analysis was presented that provided an overview about 
existing legislation in the region as well as a comparison with best practices from other regions.1321 As a 
follow up to this workshop a conference dealing with techniques of developing cybercrime policies and 
legislation was organized in August 2011 in Samoa.1322 During the conference best practices from other 
regions  were  presented  and  structures  for  a  harmonized  policy  and  legislation  were  developed.  They 
addressed substantive criminal law, procedural law, international cooperation, liability of Internet Service 
Provider (ISP), electronic evidence and crime prevention measures.  
In April 2011 the Secretariat of the Pacific Community organized a conference related to the Fight against 
Cybercrime in the Pacific.1323 The event was co-organized by the Council of Europe. During the conference 
aspects  related  to  substantive  criminal  law,  procedural  law  and  international  cooperation  were 
discussed.1324  

5.3 

Scientific and independent approaches 

Stanford Draft International Convention 

5.3.1 
A well-known example of a scientific approach to developing a legal framework for addressing cybercrime 
at the global level is the Stanford Draft International Convention (the “Stanford Draft”).1325 The Stanford 
Draft was developed as a follow-up to a conference hosted by Stanford University in the United States in 
1999.1326 Comparison with the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1327 that was drafted around 
the same time shows a number of similarities. Both cover aspects of substantive criminal law, procedural 
law  and  international  cooperation.  The  most  important  difference  is  the  fact  that  the  offences  and 
procedural  instruments  developed  by  the  Stanford  Draft  are  only  applicable  with  regard  to  attacks  on 
information  infrastructure  and  terrorist  attacks,  while  the  instruments  related  to  procedural  law  and 
international  cooperation  mentioned  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  can  also  be 
applied with regard to traditional offences as well.1328 

5.3.2  Global Protocol on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime 
During  the  Internet  Governance  Forum  in  Egypt  in  2009,  Scholberg  and  Ghernaouti-Helie  presented  a 
proposal for a Global Protocol on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime.1329 Article 1-5 relate to cybercrime and 
recommend  the  implementation  of  substantive  criminal  law  provisions,  procedural  law  provisions, 
measures  against  terrorist  misuse  of  the  Internet,  measures  for  global  cooperation  and  exchange  of 
information and measures on privacy and human rights.1330 The model legislation provided in appendix to 
the protocol is to a large degree (Articles 1-25) exactly based on the wording of the provisions provided by 
the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  

The relationship between regional and international legislative approaches 

5.4 
The success of single standards with regard to technical protocols leads to the question of how conflicts 
between  different  international  approaches  can  be  avoided.1331 The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime and the Commonwealth Model Law on Cybercrime are the frameworks that follow the most 
comprehensive  approach,  as  they  cover  substantive  criminal  law,  procedural  law  and  international 
cooperation. But none of the instruments have so far been amended to address developments that have 
taken place in recent years. In addition, the scope of both instruments is limited. The debate at the last 
UN  Crime  Congress  highlighted  the  interest  of  countries  in  international  instruments.1332 This  raises 
questions in respect of the relationship between existing regional approaches and possible international 
action. There are three possible scenarios.  
If  a  new  legal  approach  defines  standards  that  are  not  in  accordance  with  the  consistent  existing 
approaches at the regional and national level, this could, at least initially, have a negative effect on the 

144 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
necessary  harmonization  process.  It  is  therefore  likely  that  any  new  approach  will  carefully  analyse 
existing  standards  to  ensure  consistency.  One  example  is  the  criminalization  of  illegal  access  which  is 
defined in a similar manner by Section 5 of the Commonwealth Model Law on Cybercrime and Article 2 of 
the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  
In  addition,  a  new  approach  will  be  able  to  avoid  including  provisions  that  have  led  to  difficulties  in 
implementation  or  even  stopped  countries  from  acceding  to  an  instrument.  One  example  is  the 
controversially  discussed  regulation  in  Article  32b  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime. 
This  provision  was  criticized  by  the  Russian  Delegation  at  the  2007  meeting  of  the  Cybercrime 
Committee.1333 
Finally, a new international approach could – in addition to including basic standards that are similar in 
the  different  legal  approaches  –  focus  on  a  gap  analysis  to  identify  areas  that  are  not  yet  sufficiently 
addressed, and thus criminalize certain cybercrime-related acts and define procedural instruments that 
are not yet covered by existing instruments. Since 2001, a number of important developments have taken 
place.  When  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  drafted,  “phishing”,1334 “identity 
theft”1335 and  offences  related  to  online  games  and  social  networks  were  not  as  relevant  as  they  have 
since  become.  A  new  international  approach  could  continue  the  harmonization  process  by  including 
further offences with a transnational dimension.1336 

The relationship between international and national legislative approaches 

5.5 
As  pointed  out  previously,  cybercrime  is  a  truly  transnational  crime.1337 Having  regard  to  the  fact  that 
offenders  can,  in  general,  target  users  in  any  country  in  the  world,  international  cooperation  of  law-
enforcement  agencies  is  an  essential  requirement  for  international  cybercrime  investigations. 1338 
Investigations  require  means  of  cooperation  and  depend  on  the  harmonization  of  laws.  Due  to  the 
common principle of dual criminality,1339 effective cooperation first requires harmonization of substantive 
criminal  law  provisions  in  order  to  prevent  safe  havens.1340 In  addition,  it  is  necessary  to  harmonize 
investigation instruments, in order to ensure that all countries involved in an international investigation 
have  the  necessary  investigative  instruments  in  place  to  carry  out  investigations.  Finally,  effective 
cooperation  of  law-enforcement  agencies  requires  effective  procedures  on  practical  aspects.1341 The 
importance  of  harmonization  triggers  the  need  for  participation  in  the  global  harmonization  process, 
which is therefore at least a tendency, if not a necessity, for any national anti-cybercrime strategy. 

Reasons for the popularity of national approaches 

5.5.1 
Despite the widely recognized importance of harmonization, the process of implementing international 
legal  standards  is  far  from  being  completed.1342 One  of  the  reasons  why  national  approaches  play  an 
important role in the fight against cybercrime is that the impact of the crimes is not the same everywhere. 
One example is the approach taken to combat spam.1343 Spam-related e-mails especially affect developing 
countries. This issue was analysed in an OECD report.1344 Due to scarcer and more expensive resources, 
spam turns out to be a much more serious problem in developing countries than in western countries.1345 
The different impacts of cybercrime, together with existing legal structures and traditions, are the main 
reasons for a significant number of legislative initiatives at the national level which are not, or only partly, 
dedicated to the implementation of international standards.  

International vs. national solutions 

5.5.2 
In times of technical globalization this may seem like a slightly surprising discussion, as anybody wishing to 
connect  to  the  Internet  needs  to  make  use  of  the  (technical)  standard  protocols  in  place.1346 Single 
standards  are  an  essential  requirement  for  the  operation  of  the  networks.  However,  unlike  technical 
standards, the legal standards still differ.1347 It must be questioned whether national approaches can still 
work,  given  the  international  dimension  of  cybercrime.1348 The  question  is  relevant  for  all  national  and 
regional approaches that implement legislation which is not in line with existing international standards. A 
lack  of  harmonization  can  seriously  hinder  international  investigations,  whereas  national  and  regional 

 

145 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
approaches  which  go  beyond  international  standards  avoid  problems  and  difficulties  in  conducting 
international investigations.1349  
There  are  two  main  reasons  for  a  growing  number  of  regional  and  national  approaches.  The  first  is 
legislative speed. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Council of Europe can force any of their Member 
States  to  use  their  instruments.  In  particular,  the  Council  of  Europe  has  no  instrument  to  instruct  a 
signatory  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  to  ratify  it.  The  harmonization  process  is  therefore  often 
considered to be slow compared to national and regional legislative approaches.1350 Unlike the Council of 
Europe, the European Union has means to force Member States to implement framework decisions and 
directives. This is the reason why a number of European Union countries which signed the Convention on 
Cybercrime  in  2001,  but  have  not  yet  ratified  it,  have  nevertheless  implemented  the  2005  EU  Council 
Framework Decision on attacks against information systems. 
The second reason is related to national and regional differences. Some offences are only criminalized in 
certain  countries  in  a  region.  Examples  are  religious  offences. 1351 Although  it  is  unlikely  that  an 
international harmonization of criminal law provisions related to offences against religious symbols would 
be  possible,  a  national  approach  can  in  this  regard  ensure  that  legal  standards  in  one  country  can  be 
maintained. 

Difficulties of national approaches 

5.5.3 
National  approaches  face  a  number  of  problems.  In  regard  to  traditional  crimes,  the  decision  by  one 
country, or a few countries, to criminalize certain behaviours can influence the ability of offenders to act 
in those countries. However, when it comes to Internet-related offences, the ability of a single country to 
influence  the  offender  is  much  smaller  as  the  offender  can,  in  general,  act  from  any  place  with  a 
connection to the network.1352 If they act from a country that does not criminalize the certain behaviour, 
international  investigations  as  well  as  extradition  requests  will  very  often  fail.  One  of  the  key  aims  of 
international legal approaches is therefore to prevent the creation of such safe havens by providing and 
applying global standards.1353 As a result, national approaches in general require additional side measures 
to be able to work.1354 The most popular side measures are criminalization of the user in addition to the 
supplier of illegal content, and of services used in the committing a crime. 

Criminalization of the user in addition to the supplier of illegal content 
One  approach  is  criminalization  of  the  use  of  illegal  services  in  addition  to  the  sole  criminalization  of 
offering such services. The criminalization of users who are located inside the jurisdiction is an approach 
to compensate for the lack of influence on providers of the services who act from abroad. 

Criminalization of services used in the committing a crime 
A  second  approach  is  the  regulation  and  even  criminalization  of  offering  certain  services  within  the 
jurisdiction  that  are  used  for  criminal  purposes.  This  solution  goes  beyond  the  first  approach,  as  it 
concerns businesses and organizations which offer neutral services that are used for legal as well as illegal 
activities. An example of such an approach is the United States Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement 
Act of 2006.1355  
Closely related to this measure is the establishment of obligations to filter certain content available on the 
Internet.1356 Such an approach was discussed under the famous Yahoo-decision1357 and is currently being 
discussed  in  Israel,  where  access  providers  may  be  obliged  to  restrict  access  to  certain  adult-content 
websites. Attempts to control Internet content are not limited to adult content; some countries use filter 
technology to restrict access to websites that address political topics. OpenNet Initiative1358 reports that 
censorship is practised by about two dozen countries.1359 
 
 
 

146 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
 
984  This includes regional approaches.  
985  The Group of Eight (G8) consists of eight countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United 

States and the Russian Federation. The presidency of the group, which represents more than 60 per cent of the world 
economy (source: http://undp.org), rotates every year.  

986  The idea of the creation of five subgroups – among them, one on high-tech crimes – was to improve implementation of 

the 40 recommendations adopted by G8 Heads of State in 1996.  

987  The establishment of the subgroup (also described as the subgroup to the “Lyon Group”) continued the efforts of the 

G8 (at that time still G7) in the fight against organized crime, which started with the launch of the Senior Experts Group 
on Organized Crimes (the “Lyon Group”) in 1995. At the Halifax summit in 1995, the G8 stated: “We recognize that 
ultimate success requires all Governments to provide for effective measures to prevent the laundering of proceeds 
from drug trafficking and other serious crimes. To implement our commitments in the fight against transnational 
organized crime, we have established a group of senior experts with a temporary mandate to look at existing 
arrangements for cooperation both bilateral and multilateral, to identify significant gaps and options for improved 
coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps”. See: Chairman’s Statement, Halifax G7 Summit, June 17 
1995. For more information, see: ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda / High-Level Experts Group, Global Strategic Report, 
2008, page 17, available at: www.itu.int/osg/csd/cybersecurity/gca/global_strategic_report/index.html.

990  14. As the use of the Internet and other new technologies increase, more criminals are provided with opportunities to 
commit crimes remotely, via telephone lines and data networks. Presently, malicious programming code and harmful 
communications (such as child pornography) may pass through several carriers located in different countries. And 
infrastructures such as banking and finance increasingly are becoming networked and thereby vulnerable to cyber-
attack from distant locations. We convene today to provide additional personal attention to and direction for our joint 
action against this transnational criminality. 
15. Our goals are to ensure that our people are protected from those who use new technologies for criminal purposes, 
such as child exploitation, financial crime, and attacks on critical infrastructures, and to ensure that no criminal receives 
safe haven anywhere in the world. We are determined that our law enforcement authorities have the technical ability 
and legal processes to find criminals who abuse technologies and bring them to justice. The safety of our people and 
their economic prosperity depend upon our leadership and determination and our ability to take coordinated action. 
We direct our experts to continue their work, particularly, on problems which arise for our law enforcement authorities 
from new developments in information technology and their use by criminals.  
16. Strength of G-8 Legal Systems. Our experts have completed a comprehensive review of G-8 legal systems to assess 
whether those systems appropriately criminalize abuses of telecommunications and computer systems and promote 
the investigation of high-tech crimes. While, over the past decade, our governments have acted to see that their legal 
systems account for new technologies, there remains room for improvement. Where laws or legal processes require 
enhancements, we are committed to use best efforts to fill these gaps and, consistent with fundamental national legal 
principles, to promote new legal mechanisms for law enforcement to facilitate investigations and prosecutions.  
17. Principles on Transborder Access to Stored Computer Data. Criminals take advantage of the jurisdictional inability of 
law enforcement authorities to operate across national borders as easily as criminals can. High-tech crimes may rapidly 
affect people in many countries, and evidence of these crimes, which may be quickly altered or destroyed, may be 
located anywhere in the world. Recognizing these facts, and taking into account principles relating to sovereignty and to 
the protection of human rights, democratic freedoms and privacy, our law enforcement authorities conducting criminal 
investigations should in some circumstances be able to pursue investigations across territorial borders. We have today 
adopted certain principles for access to data stored in a foreign state, which are contained in the Annex 1 to this 
Communique. We are committed to work towards implementation of these principles through international 
cooperation, including legal instruments, and through national laws and policies, and invite all nations to join in this 
effort. We note, however, that continued work is required in this area, including on the appropriate collection, 
preservation and disclosure of traffic data, and we direct our experts to make further progress in consultation with 
industry.

18. Locating and Identifying High-tech Criminals. To ensure that we can all locate and identify criminals who use 
networked communications for illegal purposes, we must enhance our ability to trace communications while they are 
occurring and afterwards, even when those communications pass through multiple countries. Existing processes are 
often too slow and are designed more to address bilateral cooperation than crimes requiring the immediate assistance 
of many countries. Faster or novel solutions must be found. We, as Ministers, direct our experts to develop, in 
consultation with industry, a concrete set of options for tracing networked communications across national borders in 
criminal investigations and provide those options as soon as possible within one year. 
19. International Network of 24-hour Contacts. Our 24-hour points of contact network, which allows us to respond to 
fast-breaking investigations, has now been expanded from the eight G-8 countries to a number of additional countries 
around the world. The speed of electronic communications and perishability of electronic evidence requires real-time 
assistance, and this growing global network has dramatically increased our investigative abilities. We direct our experts 
to facilitate further growth of this network. G-8 nations and their partners should also use this network proactively to 
notify other countries when they learn of significant potential threats to our shared networks.  
20. Criminality Associated with the ‘Millennium Bug’. Our countries have been at the forefront of efforts to successfully 
tackle the ‘Millennium Bug’ or ‘Y2K Problem’, which presents a major threat to the increasingly networked global 
economy. We are concerned that the Millennium Bug may either provide new opportunities for fraud and financial 
crimes, or mask ongoing criminality, if systems for accounting and reporting are disrupted. Therefore, as part of our 
new proactive use of our 24-hour network, we will provide early warning of Y2K-related abuses. 
21. Internet Fraud. We recognize that Internet fraud, in all of its forms, poses a significant threat to the growth and 
development of electronic commerce and to the confidence that consumers place in electronic commercial 
transactions. To counter this threat, we are undertaking a comprehensive response, including crime prevention, 
investigation, and prosecution. For example, we are sharing information on international Internet fraud schemes – 
including information relating to the criminals, their methods and techniques, the victims involved in these schemes, 
and reports of enforcement actions – so that criminals defrauding people in multiple countries are investigated and 
prosecuted for the full range of their criminal activities. 

991  The idea of a 24/7 network has been picked up by a number of international approaches in the fight against cybercrime. 

One example is Article 35 of the Convention on Cybercrime:  

 

(1) Each Party shall designate a point of contact available on a twenty-four hour, seven-day-a-week basis, in order to 
ensure the provision of immediate assistance for the purpose of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal 
offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal 
offence. Such assistance shall include facilitating, or, if permitted by its domestic law and practice, directly carrying 
out the following measures: 
a) the provision of technical advice; 
b) the preservation of data pursuant to Articles 29 and 30;  
c) the collection of evidence, the provision of legal information, and locating of suspects. […] 

 
 
 
992  Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the French Minister of the Interior, stated: “Now that the G8 has provided the impetus, it’s 
vital that we formalize the new legal rules and procedures for cooperation in a legal instrument applying world-wide. 
For France, the negotiations under way in the Council of Europe on a Convention on Cyber-Crime are of fundamental 
importance for several reasons. The draft currently under discussion defines the offences which all States would have to 
recognize. It goes on to propose ways in which they could cooperate, taking up, for example, the idea of national 
contact points. It also proposes extradition procedures. In short, this agreement is an essential instrument, which 
France wants to see concluded within a reasonable period of time. The important thing about these negotiations is that 
the countries involved include some major countries outside the Council of Europe and that, once signed, this 
convention will be opened for signature by all States wishing to accede to it. The idea is in fact to get a convention 
which applies world-wide so that there can be no more “digital havens” or “Internet havens” in which anyone wanting 
to engage in shady activities can find all the facilities they need, including financial ones, for laundering the product of 
their crimes. Since we must never lose sight of the fact that the Internet is a global system and that no country can 
isolate itself from the rules under which it has to operate.”

996  G8 Justice and Home Affairs Communiqué Washington DC, 11 May 2004:10. “Continuing to Strengthen Domestic Laws: 

To truly build global capacities to combat terrorist and criminal uses of the Internet, all countries must continue to 
improve laws that criminalize misuses of computer networks and that allow for faster cooperation on Internet-related 
investigations. With the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime coming into force on July 1, 2004, we should take 
steps to encourage the adoption of the legal standards it contains on a broad basis.” 

997  The participants expressed their intention to strengthen the instruments in the fight against cybercrime: “We discussed 

the necessity of improving effective countermeasures that will prevent IT terrorism and terrorist acts in this sphere of 
high technologies. For that, it is necessary to devise a set of measures to prevent such possible criminal acts, including 
in the sphere of telecommunication. That includes work against the selling of private data, counterfeit information and 
application of viruses and other harmful computer programs. We will instruct our experts to generate unified 
approaches to fighting cyber criminality, and we will need an international legal base for this particular work, and we 
will apply all of that to prevent terrorists from using computer and Internet sites for hiring new terrorists and the 
recruitment of other illegal actors”. See: www.g7.utoronto.ca/justice/justice2006.htm.

1072 The Guidelines deal with investigative instruments (e.g. search and seizure) as well as electronic evidence and 

international cooperation. 

1073 Decision CDPC/103/211196. CDPC explained its decision by pointing out the international dimension of computer 
crimes: “By connecting to communication and information services, users create a kind of common space, called 
“cyber-space”, which is used for legitimate purposes, but may also be the subject of misuse. These “cyber-space 
offences” are either committed against the integrity, availability and confidentiality of computer systems and 
telecommunication networks or they consist of the use of such networks of their services to commit traditional 
offences. The transborder character of such offences, e.g. when committed through the Internet, is in conflict with the 
territoriality of national law enforcement authorities.”

1082 Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic 

nature committed through computer systems, ETS No. 189, available at: http://conventions.coe.int. 

1083 Explanatory Report to the First Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime No. 4: “The 

committee drafting the Convention on Cybercrime discussed the possibility of including other content-related offences, 
such as the distribution of racist propaganda through computer systems. However, the committee was not in a position 
to reach consensus on the criminalisation of such conduct. While there was significant support in favour of including 
this as a criminal offence, some delegations expressed strong concern about including such a provision on freedom of 
expression grounds. Noting the complexity of the issue, it was decided that the committee would refer to the European 
Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC) the issue of drawing up an additional Protocol to the Convention on 
Cybercrime.”

1198 “Article 4 of the Framework Decision on combating terrorism states that inciting, aiding or abetting terrorist offences 
should be made punishable by the Member States. Article 2 of the same instrument requires Member States to hold 
those directing a terrorist group or participating in its activities criminally liable. However, these provisions do not 
explicitly cover the dissemination of terrorist propaganda and terrorist expertise, in particular through the Internet.” 
1199 “Training for terrorism” means to provide instruction in the making or use of explosives, firearms or other weapons or 
noxious or hazardous substances, or in other specific methods or techniques, for the purpose of committing one of the 
acts listed in Article 1(1), knowing that the skills provided are intended to be used for this purpose.

1334 The term “phishing” originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of 
Internet users. The use of “ph” linked to popular hacker naming conventions, see Gercke, Computer und Recht, 2005,

1336 There are two aspects that need to be taken into consideration in this context: To avoid redundancy, a new approach 

should focus on offences that are not intended to be covered within further amendments of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The second aspect is related to the difficulties in finding a common position all countries can agree on. 
Based on the experiences with the negotiations of the Convention on cybercrime, it is likely that negotiations of 
criminalization that go beyond the standards of the Convention will run into difficulties.

1339 Dual criminality exists if the offence is a crime under both the requested and requesting party’s laws. The difficulties 

which the dual criminality principle can cause within international investigations is currently addressed in a number of 
international conventions and treaties. One example is Art. 2 of the EU Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the 
European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JHA).

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 

Legal response 

6. 
The following chapter will provide an overview of legal response to the phenomenon of cybercrime by 
explaining legal approaches in criminalizing certain acts.1360 Wherever possible, international approaches 
will be presented. In cases where international approaches are lacking, examples of national or regional 
approaches will be provided.  

Definitions 

6.1 
Bibliography (selected): Bayles, Definitions in law, published in Fetzer/Shatz/Schlesinger, Definitions and 
Definability: Philosophical Perspectives, 1991, page 253 et seq; Lindahl, Deduction and Justification in the 
Law. Role of  Legal Terms and Conditions, Ratio Juris, Vol. 17, Iss. 2, 2004, page 182 et seq.; Macagno, 
Definitions in Law, Bulletin Suisse de Linguistique Appliquée, Vol. 2, 2010, page 199 et seq, available at: 
http://ssrn.com/abstract=1742946. 

The function of definitions 

6.1.1 
Definitions  are  a  common  element  of  various  national  and  regional  legal  frameworks.  However  it  is 
important to differentiate between different functions that those definitions have. In law it is in general 
possible  to  divide  into  two  classes  of  definitions:  descriptive  and  statutory  definitions.1361 Descriptive 
definitions  are  used  to  explain  the  meaning  of  ambiguous  words  while  statutory  definitions  intend  to 
commit those that are subject to law to a particular definition of a word.1362 The following overview does 
not distinguish between those two types of definition.  
Regional legal frameworks and model laws do not only follow different concepts with regard to the type 
of definitions but also when it comes to quantitative aspects. The Convention on Cybercrime, for example, 
only contains five definitions1363 while the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime contains twenty.  

Access provider 

6.1.2 
Access providers play an important role as they enable users to connect to the Internet. In cybercrime law 
the  term  access  provider  is  used  both  with  regard  to  the  regulation  of  liability1364 as  well  as  the 
involvement in investigations – especially the lawful interception of communication.1365 A definition of the 
term is provided in the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.  
 
Definitions  
3. (1) Access provider means any natural or legal person providing an electronic data transmission service 
by  transmitting  information  provided  by  or  to  a  user  of  the  service  in  a  communication  network  or 
providing access to a communication network.  
[…] 
 
The provision is broad as it covers commercial providers as well as companies that only provide access for 
employees  and  operators  of  private  networks.  While  this  approach  is  useful  when  it  comes  to  a  wide 
application of liability regulations, it could lead to challenges if the definition is also applied in procedural 
law (which was not intended by the drafters of the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text).  

Caching provider 

6.1.3 
Caching providers provide an important service to increase the speed of access to popular content. With 
regard  to  the  need  to  regulate  the  liability1366 of  caching  providers,  the  drafters  of  the  HIPCAR  Model 
Legislative Text on Cybercrime decided to include a definition.  
 
Definitions  

 

169 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
3. […] 
(2) Caching provider means any natural or legal person providing an electronic data transmission service 
by automatic, intermediate and temporary storing information, performed for the sole purpose of making 
more efficient the information's onward transmission to other users of the service upon their request;  
[…] 
 
Just like their definition for access provider, the drafters did not limit the application of the provision to 
commercial  operations.  As  a  consequence  the  provision  also  covers  companies  and  private  network 
operators.  

Child 

6.1.4 
The term child is especially relevant with regard to the criminalization of child pornography.1367 It is also 
used in the context of provisions that criminalize making certain content (for example adult pornography) 
available to minors.1368 One of the most frequently used definitions is provided in the UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child from 1989.  
 
For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen 
years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. 

Several cybercrime-specific legal frameworks and model laws, such as the 2011 EU Directive on combating 
child  pornography1369,  the  2007  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children1370 and  the 
2009 HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime1371 contain similar definitions. The Council of Europe 
Convention on Cybercrime does not define child but only child pornography.  

Child pornography 

6.1.5 
Child  pornography  is  one  of  the  few  offences  related  to  the  category  of  illegal  content  where  most 
countries in the world agree to a criminalization.1372 As the differentiation between legal forms of sexual-
related material and child pornography can be challenging, some legal frameworks provide a definition of 
child pornography.  
One major challenge for law drafters in this regard is to avoid conflicts between different categories of 
age in order to avoid a potentially unintended criminalization in cases where the age of marriage or sexual 
consent  and  the  age-limit  within  the  definition  of  child  pornography  differ.1373 If,  for  example,  child 
pornography is defined as visual depiction of sexual acts of a person below the age of 18 and at the same 
time the age of sexual consent and marriage is 16, two 17 year old children can legally get married or 
have a sexual relationship but will be committing a serious crime (production of child pornography) if they 
take pictures or movies of this act.1374 
One definition is provided by Article 2 c) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. 
 
Article 2 
For the purpose of the present Protocol: 
[…] 
 

(c) Child pornography means any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or 
simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily 
sexual purposes. 

 
The  definition  provided  in  the  Optional  Protocol  does  not  explicitly  cover  forms  of  fictional  child 
pornography such as realistic images. To ensure that such material is also covered some legal frameworks, 
such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  have  amended  the  definition  of  child 
pornography.  

170 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
Article 9 – Offences related to child pornography 
[…] 
(2)  For  the  purpose  of  paragraph  1  above,  the  term  “child  pornography”  shall  include  pornographic 
material that visually depicts: 
 
 
 
(3) For the purpose of paragraph 2 above, the term “minor” shall include all persons under 18 years of age. 
A Party may, however, require a lower age-limit, which shall be not less than 16 years. 
[…] 
 

a) a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; 
b) a person appearing to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; 
c) realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. 

Article 9, paragraph 2, provides three subsections on material that visually depicts child pornography: a 
minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, a person appearing to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit 
conduct and realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.  
While  in  this  regard  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  expands  the  definition  provided  in  the  Optional 
Protocol to the UN Convention, on the other hand it narrows the applicability in two important aspects. 
Although  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  emphasised  the  importance  of  a  uniform 
international  standard  regarding  age1375 the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  nevertheless  permits  parties  to 
require a different age limit of not lower than 16 years.  
The  second  major  difference  to  the  definition  provided  in  the  Optional  Protocol  is  the  fact  that  the 
definition  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  focuses  on  visual  depiction.  Child 
pornography is not necessary distributed as pictures or movies, but also as audio files.1376 Due to the fact 
that the provision provided in Article 9 refers to “material that visually depicts” a child, the provision does 
not cover audio files.  
As  a  consequence,  more  recent  approaches  such  as  the  HIPCAR1377 cybercrime  legislative  text1378 follow 
the concept of the Option Protocol to the UN Convention instead of the Council of Europe Convention and 
avoid the term “visually”.  
 
Definitions  
3. 
 […](4) Child pornography means pornographic material that depicts presents or represents: 
 
 
 
this includes, but is not limited to, any audio, visual or text pornographic material. 
A country may restrict the criminalisation by not implementing (b) and (c). 
 
Definitions  of  child  pornography  are  also  contained  in  the  2011  EU  Directive  on  combating  child 
pornography1379, and the 2007 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children.1380 

a) a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct;  
b) a person appearing to be a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or 
c) images representing a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct; 

Computer data 

6.1.6 
The  increasing  use  of  computer  technology  as  well  as  the  trend  to  digitalization  of  data  led  to  an 
increasing relevance of computer data. As a consequence computer data has become a frequent target of 
attacks that range from data interference1381 to data espionage.1382 Various regional frameworks contain 
definitions for computer data. One example is section 3 of the Commonwealth Model Law on Computer 
and Computer-related Crime. 
 

 

171 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Definitions  
3.  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
“computer  data”  means  any  representation  of  facts,  information  or  concepts  in  a  form  suitable  for 
processing in a computer system, including a program suitable to cause a computer system to perform a 
function;  
[…] 

Similar definitions are contained in the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1383, the 2005 EU 
Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems1384, 2008 Draft ECOWAS Directive on 
Fighting Cyber Crime1385, and the 2009 HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime1386.  

Computer data storage device 

6.1.7 
Storage  devices  play  an  important  role  with  regard  to  cybercrime  –  both  with  regard  to  possible  data 
interference as well as with regard to the seizure of evidence. One example for a regional framework that 
contains a definition is section 3 if the Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related 
Crime. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…] 
“computer  data  storage  medium”  means  any  article  or  material  (for  example,  a  disk)  from  which 
information is capable of being reproduced, with or without the aid of any other article or device;  
[…] 

A similar definition is contained in HIPCAR Model Legislative Text.1387  

Computer system 

6.1.8 
In cybercrime laws the term computer system is used in relation to substantive criminal law as well as 
procedural  law.  Computer  systems  can  be  the  target  of  an  attack;  they  can  be  used  as  a  tool  when 
committing  a  crime  and  finally  can  be  seized  as  evidence.  Consequently  most  applicable  regional 
frameworks  and  model  laws  contain  such  a  definition.  One  example  is  section  3  of  the  2002 
Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related Crime. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…] 
 “computer  system”  means  a  device  or  a  group  of  inter-connected  or  related  devices,  including  the 
Internet,  one  or  more  of  which,  pursuant  to  a  program,  performs  automatic  processing  of  data  or  any 
other function;  
[…] 

One unusual aspect is the fact that the definition mentions “the Internet”. The Internet is widely defined 
as a system of interconnected networks.1388 From a technical perspective the Internet itself is therefore 
not  a  computer  system  but  a  network  and  should  consequently  not  be  included  in  the  definition  of 
computer systems but may be included in the definition of computer networks. However, several drafters 
of legal frameworks followed the example of the Commonwealth Model Law and included the Internet in 
the definition of computer system. 
Definitions are also contained in the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1389, the 2005 EU 
Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems1390, 2008 Draft ECOWAS Directive on 
Fighting Cyber Crime1391, and the 2009 HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime1392  

172 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Critical infrastructure 

 
6.1.9 
As a consequence of an increasing use of computer and network technology in the operation of critical 
infrastructure,  such  infrastructure  is  a  possible  target  for  attacks.1393 Taking  into  account  the  potential 
impact of such attack, some of the more recent frameworks include a specific criminalization/aggravation 
penalty for certain attacks against critical infrastructure and consequently also a definition. One example 
is the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…] 
 (8)  Critical  infrastructure  means  computer  systems,  devices,  networks,  computer  programs,  computer 
data, so vital to the country that the incapacity or destruction of or interference with such systems and 
assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national or economic security, national public health 
and safety, or any combination of those matters. 
[…] 

6.1.10  Cryptology 
The use of encryption technology by offenders can seriously hinder access to relevant evidence.1394 As a 
consequence several countries implemented legislation addressing the use of encryption technology and 
related  investigation  instruments  of  law  enforcement. 1395 However,  out  of  the  different  regional 
frameworks addressing cybercrime only the draft African Union Convention on Cyber Security1396 provides 
a definition of cryptology in Article I-1.  
 
8)  Cryptology  means  the  science  of  protecting  and  securing  information  particularly  for  the  purpose  of 
ensuring confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation;  

6.1.11  Device 
The term device is especially used in relation to the criminalization of “illegal devices”.1397 With regard to 
the  potential  risk  that  such  devices  may  be  widely  spread  and  used  to  commit  crimes,  the  drafters  of 
several regional frameworks decided to include a provision criminalizing certain activities related to illegal 
devices. Unlike the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth Model Law, that 
both use the term device, the HIPCAR Model Legislative contains a definition of the term in section 3. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…] 
 (9) Device includes but is not limited to  
 
 
 
 
[…] 

a) components of computer systems such as graphic cards, memory, chips; 
b) storage components such as hard drives, memory cards, compact discs, tapes; 
c) input devices such as keyboards, mouse, track pad, scanner, digital cameras;  
d) output devices such as printer, screens. 

It is a typical descriptive definition as the provision explicitly indicates that the definition of device shall 
not  be  limited  to  the  components  listed  (“includes  but  is  not  limited  to”).  With  reference  to  the 
underlying provision1398 that criminalizes illegal devices the term also includes computer programs.  

 

173 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
6.1.12  Hindering 
In information societies and economies that include e-commerce the functioning of computer systems is 
essential. Attacks against computer system that hinder the computer system from carrying out operations 
can  seriously  interfere  with  the  society  and  economy.  As  a  consequence  many  regional  frameworks 
criminalize  hindering  a  computer  system  from  functioning.1399 The  HIPCAR  Model  Legislative  Text  on 
Cybercrime contains a Cybercrime-specific definition of the term hindering in section 3. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
 (10) Hinder in relation to a computer system includes but is not limited to:  
 
 
 
 

a) cutting the electricity supply to a computer system; and 
b) causing electromagnetic interference to a computer system; and 
c) corrupting a computer system by any means; and 
d)  inputting,  transmitting,  damaging,  deleting,  deteriorating,  altering  or  suppressing  computer 
data. 

[…] 

The  definition  underlines  that  manipulations  include  physical  interference  (such  as  cutting  electrical 
supply) as well as data related manipulations (such as inputting computer data).  

6.1.13  Hosting provider 
Hosting providers play a crucial role with regard to the fight against cybercrime as their services are, for 
example,  used  to  store  illegal  content.  Consequently  different  regional  frameworks  deal  with  issues 
related to ISP liability.1400 However, the main regional frameworks do not provide a definition of hosting 
provider. But such a definition is included in the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.  
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
(11) Hosting provider means any natural or legal person providing an electronic data transmission service 
by storing of information provided by a user of the service.  
[…] 

The  definition  does  not  limit  the  application  of  the  provision  to  commercial  provider  but  also  includes 
private operator. As a consequence even the operator of a private website that enables others to store 
information on the website can be covered by related liability regulations.  

6.1.14  Hyperlink 
While very often only hosting provider, access provider and caching provider are listed as sub-categories 
to Internet Service Provider (ISP) several legal frameworks provide specific regulations for other service 
such as search engines1401 and hyperlinks. In this regard the HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime 
provides a definition for Hyperlinks.  
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
(12) Hyperlink means characteristic or property of an element such as symbol, word, phrase, sentence, or 
image  that  contains  information  about  another  source  and  points  to  and  causes  to  display  another 
document when executed.  
[…] 

174 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The definition is broad and covers various types of hyperlinks such as deep links.  

Interception 

6.1.15 
The term interception is frequently used in substantive criminal law with regard to the criminalization of 
illegal  interception1402 as  well  as  in  criminal  procedural  law  with  regard  to  the  lawful  interception  of 
communication. While regional frameworks like the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the 
Commonwealth  Model  Law  contain  provisions  related  to  illegal  as  well  as  lawful  interception,  those 
frameworks  do  not  provide  a  definition  of  interception.  However,  such  provision  is  contained  in  the 
HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
(13) Interception includes but is not limited to the acquiring, viewing and capturing of any computer data 
communication  whether  by  wire,  wireless,  electronic,  optical,  magnetic,  oral,  or  other  means,  during 
transmission through the use of any technical device.  
[…]  

Interference 

6.1.16 
Interference is a standard term that is used in several provisions related to Cybercrime. Examples are data 
interference1403 as  well  as  system  interference.1404 However,  in  several  regional  instruments  the  term  is 
only  used  within  the  headlines  of  certain  provisions  but  does  not  describe  a  criminalized  act  itself. 
Consequently most regional frameworks and model laws do not further define the term.  

6.1.17  Multiple electronic mails 
A significant number of all e-mails that are sent out are SPAM. As a consequence a number of countries, 
as  well  as  recent  model  laws,  have  included  provisions  criminalizing  acts  related  to  the  distribution  of 
SPAM.1405 One  key  term  used  within  such  provision  is  “multiple  electronic  mail”.  The  HIPCAR  Model 
Legislative Text on Cybercrime contains a definition for this term.  
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
(14) Multiple electronic mail messages mean a mail message including E-Mail and instant messaging sent 
to more that thousand recipients.  
[…] 

6.1.18  Remote forensic software 
Some more recent and advanced legal frameworks contain procedural instruments that in certain cases 
authorize law enforcement agencies to apply advanced forensic tools – such as keylogger.1406 The HIPCAR 
Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime contains a definition for the term remote forensic software. 
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
(15) Remote forensic software means an investigative software installed on a computer system and used 
to perform tasks that include but are not limited to keystroke logging or transmission of an IP-address.  
[…] 

 

175 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Within discussion about the use of the HIPCAR standards, which were developed for the Caribbean, in the 
Pacific it was pointed out that in order to cover the full range of forensic solutions the term tool (that also 
covers hardware solutions) is favourable compared to software.  

6.1.19  Seize 
Not only with regard to traditional crimes but also in relation to Cybercrime, seizure remains one of the 
most important investigation instruments used to collect evidence.1407 The Commonwealth Model Law on 
Computer  and  Computer-related  Crime  contains  a  definition  of  seizure  in  Part  III,  Procedural  Powers, 
section 11. 
 
Definitions for this Part 
[…] 
11. In this Part:  
[…]  
 “seize” includes: 
 
 
 

(a) make and retain a copy of computer data, including by using onsite equipment; and 
(b) render inaccessible, or remove, computer data in the accessed computer system; and 
(c) take a printout of output of computer data. 

This  definition  that  contains  three  sub-sections  was  further  amended  within  the  development  of  the 
HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime. A definition was included in section 3 (16).  
 
Definitions   
3. 
[…]  
(16) Seize includes: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[…]  

activating any onsite computer system and computer data storage media;  
making and retaining a copy of computer data, including by using onsite equipment;  
maintaining the integrity of the relevant stored computer data; 
rendering inaccessible, or removing, computer data in the accessed computer system;  
taking a printout of output of computer data; or 
seize or similarly secure a computer system or part of it or a computer-data storage medium. 

a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
f. 

The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime followed a different approach and included the different 
elements of seizure in the provision itself.1408  

6.1.20  Service provider 
Service provider is a category used to describe different types of providers offering Internet services. As 
underlined above different regional frameworks include provisions addressing service provider (such as 
provisions  related  to  the  liability  of  different  types  of  service  provider  or  procedural  instruments  that 
require  the  support  of  law  enforcement  activities  by  a  service  provider).  Not  all  of  them  differentiate 
between  different  types  of  provider.  Consequently,  especially  those  regional  frameworks  that  do  not 
differentiate,  include  a  definition  of  the  term  service  provider.  One  example  is  the  Council  of  Europe 
Convention on Cybercrime.  
 
Article 1 – Definitions 
[…] 
c) “service provider” means:  
 

i.  any  public  or  private  entity  that  provides  to  users  of  its  service  the  ability  to  communicate  by 
means of a computer system, and  

176 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

ii. any other entity that processes or stores computer data on behalf of such communication service 
or users of such service. 

 
 

[…] 

The 2002 Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related Crime1409, and the 2009 HIPCAR 
Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime1410 also contain similar definitions.  

6.1.21  Traffic data 
Traffic  data  is  a  category  of  data  for  which  some  regional  legal  frameworks  and  model  laws  provide 
specific  investigations  instruments.1411 Consequently  those  regional  frameworks  and  model  laws  often 
also provide a definition. One example is section 3 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law on Computer 
and Computer-related Crime.  
 
Definitions  
3.   
[…]  
 “traffic data” means computer data: 
 
 
 

(a) that relates to a communication by means of a computer system; and 
(b) is generated by a computer system that is part of the chain of communication; and 
(c) shows the communication’s origin, destination, route, time date, size, duration or the type of 
underlying services. 

Similar definitions are provided in the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime1412, and the 2009 
HIPCAR Model Legislative Text on Cybercrime.1413

Illegal access (hacking) 

6.2.1 
Since the development of computer networks, by virtue of their ability to connect computers and offer 
users access to other computer systems, computers have been used by hackers for criminal purposes.1414 
There  is  substantial  variation  in  hackers’  motivations. 1415 Hackers  need  not  be  present  at  the  crime 
scene;1416 they just need to circumvent the protection securing the network.1417 In many cases of illegal 
access, the security systems protecting the physical location of network hardware are more sophisticated 
than the security systems protecting sensitive information on networks, even in the same building.1418  
Illegal  access  to  computer  systems  hinders  computer  operators  in  managing,  operating  and  controlling 
their  systems  in  an  undisturbed  and  uninhibited  manner.1419 The  aim  of  protection  is  to  maintain  the 
integrity of computer systems.1420 It is vital to distinguish between illegal access and subsequent offences 
(such  as  data  espionage1421),  since  legal  provisions  have  a  different  focus  of  protection.  In  most  cases, 

178 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
illegal access (where law seeks to protect the integrity of the computer system itself) is not the end goal, 
but  rather  a  first  step  towards  further  crimes,  such  as  modifying  or  obtaining  stored  data  (where  law 
seeks to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data).1422 
The  question  is  whether  the  act  of  illegal  access  should  be  criminalized,  in  addition  to  subsequent 
offences.1423 Analysis  of  the  various  approaches  to  the  criminalization  of  illegal  computer  access  at  the 
national level shows that enacted provisions sometimes confuse illegal access with subsequent offences, 
or seek to limit the criminalization of illegal access to grave violations only.1424 Some countries criminalize 
mere access, while others limit criminalization only to offences where the accessed system is protected by 
security  measures,  or  where  the  perpetrator  has  harmful  intentions,  or  where  data  were  obtained, 
modified  or  damaged.1425 Other  countries  do  not  criminalize  the  access  itself,  but  only  subsequent 
offences.1426 Opponents to the criminalization of illegal access refer to situations where no dangers were 
created  by  mere  intrusion,  or  where  acts  of  “hacking”  have  led  to  the  detection  of  loopholes  and 
weaknesses in the security of targeted computer systems.1427

The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  on  illegal  access  protecting  the 
integrity  of  computer  systems  by  criminalizing  unauthorized  access  to  a  system.  Noting  inconsistent 
approaches at the national level,1428 the Convention on Cybercrime offers the possibility of limitations that 
–  at  least  in  most  cases  –  enable  countries  without  legislation  to  retain  more  liberal  laws  on  illegal 
access.1429 The provision aims to protect the integrity of computer systems. 

The provision 
 
Article 2 – Illegal access 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the access to the whole or any part of a 
computer system without right. A Party may require that the offence be committed by infringing security 
measures,  with  the  intent  of  obtaining  computer  data  or  other  dishonest  intent,  or  in  relation  to  a 
computer system that is connected to another computer system. 

The acts covered 
The term “access” does not specify a certain means of communication, but is open-ended and open to 
further  technical  developments.1430 It  shall  include  all  means  of  entering  another  computer  system, 
including Internet attacks,1431 as well as illegal access to wireless networks. Even unauthorized access to 
computers  that  are  not  connected  to  any  network  (e.g.  by  circumventing  password  protection)  are 
covered  by  the  provision.1432 This  broad  approach  means  that  illegal  access  not  only  covers  future 
technical developments, but also covers secret data accessed by insiders and employees.1433 The second 
sentence of Article 2 offers the possibility of limiting the criminalization of illegal access to access over a 
network.1434  
The  illegal  acts  and  protected  systems  are  thus  defined  in  a  way  that  remains  open  to  future 
developments. The Explanatory Report lists hardware, components, stored data, directories, traffic and 
content-related data as examples of the parts of computer systems that can be accessed. 1435  

Mental element 
Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 2 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1436 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain 
a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.  In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  pointed  out  that 
“intentionally” should be defined at national level.1437  

 

179 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Without right 
Access to a computer can only be prosecuted under Article 2 of the Convention on Cybercrime if it takes 
place “without right”. 1438 Access to a system permitting free and open access by the public or access to a 
system with the authorization of the owner or other rights-holder is not “without right”. 1439 In addition to 
the  subject  of  free  access,  the  legitimacy  of  security  testing  procedures  is  also  addressed.1440 Network 
administrators and security companies that test the protection of computer systems in order to identify 
potential  gaps  in  security  measures  were  wary  of  the  risk  of  criminalization  under  illegal  access.1441 
Despite the fact that these professionals generally work with the permission of the owner and therefore 
act legally, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime emphasized that “testing or protection of the 
security of a computer system authorized by the owner or operator, [...] are with right”.1442  
The fact that the victim of the crime has handed out a password or similar access code to the offender 
does not necessarily mean that the offender then acted with right when accessed the victim’s computer 
system. If the offender has persuaded the victim to disclose a password or access code by means of a 
successful social-engineering approach,1443 it is necessary to verify if the authorization given by the victim 
covers the act carried out by the offender.1444 In general, this is not the case and the offender therefore 
acts without right.  

Restrictions and reservations 
As an alternative to the broad approach, the Convention on Cybercrime offers the possibility of restricting 
criminalization with additional elements, listed in the second sentence.1445 The procedure of how to utilize 
this reservation is laid down in Article 42 of the Convention on Cybercrime.1446 Possible reservations relate 
to  security  measures,1447 special  intent  to  obtain  computer  data,1448 other  dishonest  intent  that  justifies 
criminal culpability, or requirements that the offence be committed against a computer system through a 
network.1449 A similar approach can be found in the EU1450 Council Framework Decision on attacks against 
information systems.1451  

Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related Crime 
A similar approach can be found in section 5 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1452 As in the Council 
of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the provision protects the integrity of computer systems.  
 
Illegal access 5. 
A  person  who  intentionally,  without  lawful  excuse  or  justification,  accesses  the  whole  or  any  part  of  a 
computer  system  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by  imprisonment  for  a  period  not 
exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 

Section  5  follows  an  approach  that  is  similar  to  Article  5  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime. The main difference to the Convention on Cybercrime is that the Commonwealth Model Law, 
does not contain options to make reservations. 

European Union Council Framework Decision on attacks against iInformation systems 
The  2005  EU  Council  Framework  Decision  on  attacks  against  information  systems  contains  a  provision 
criminalizing illegal access to information systems in Article 2. 
 
Article 2 – Illegal access to information systems 
1.  Each  Member  State  shall  take  the  necessary  measures to  ensure that  the  intentional  access without 
right to the whole or any part of an information system is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for 
cases which are not minor. 
2. Each Member State may decide that the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 is incriminated only where 
the offence is committed by infringing a security measure. 
 

180 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
All  substantive  criminal  law  provisions  of  the  framework  decision  were  drafted  in  accordance  with  the 
standards  defined  by  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1453 The  main  difference  to  the 
Convention on Cybercrime is the fact that Member States can limit criminalization to cases which are not 
minor.  In  this  context,  the  framework  decision  explicitly  points  out  that  minor  cases  should  not  be 
covered by the instrument.1454  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The  informal1455 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  recognizes  illegal  access  as  one  of  the 
offences the signatory states should criminalize.  

The provision 
 
Art. 3 – Offences 
1. Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any 
of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent: 
[...] 
(c) enters into a cybersystem for which access is restricted in a conspicuous and unambiguous manner; 
[...] 

The acts covered 
The draft provision displays a number of similarities to Article 2 of the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime.  Both  require  an  intentional  act  that  is  committed  without  right/without  authority.  In  this 
context,  the  requirement  of  the  draft  provision  (“without  legally  recognized  authority,  permission,  or 
consent “) is more precise than the term “without right”1456 used by the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime, and explicitly aims to incorporate the concept of self-defence.1457 Another difference to the 
regional approaches such as the Convention on Cybercrime is the fact that the draft provision uses the 
term  “cybersystem”.  The  cybersystem  is  defined  in  Article  1,  paragraph  3  of  the  Draft  Convention.  It 
covers  any  computer  or  network  of  computers  used  to  relay,  transmit,  coordinate  or  control 
communications of data or programs. This definition shows many similarities to the definition of the term 
“computer  system”  provided  by  Article 1  a)  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.1458 
Although the Draft Convention refers to acts related to the exchange of data and does therefore primarily 
focus on network-based computer systems, both definitions include interconnected computers as well as 
standalone machines.1459 

Illegal remaining 

6.2.2 
The integrity of computer systems can be violated not only by illegally entering a computer system, but 
also  by  continuing  to  use  a  computer  system  after  permission  has  expired.  Since  in  such  cases  the 
computer  system  was  not  accessed  illegally,  the  application  of  provisions  criminalizing  illegal  access  to 
computer systems can run into difficulties.  

Council of Europe 
The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime criminalizes illegal access to a computer system, but not 
illegal remaining in a computer system. Nevertheless, illegal remaining was discussed during negotiation 
of the Convention. In 1998, when the fourth draft version of the Convention on Cybercrime was finished, 
it still contained this element. 
 
Art. 2 – Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law [when committed intentionally] the following conduct: 
[…] 
 

 

181 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
1bis: The intentional failure to exit a computer system, the whole or a part of which has been accessed 
inadvertently without right by a person, as soon as he becomes aware of this [undue] situation. 
[…] 
 
However, the final version of the Convention on Cybercrime that was opened for signature in 2001 no 
longer contained such a provision. 

Example 
Some  of  the  recent  approaches  such  as  the  HIPCAR1460 cybercrime  legislative  text1461 include  specific 
provisions to address this issue. Section  5 criminalizes illegal remaining in a computer system. Like the 
criminalization of illegal access, the protected legal interest is the integrity of computer systems. 
 
Illegal Remaining 
5.(1) A person who intentionally, without lawful excuse or justification or in excess of a lawful excuse or 
justification,  remains  logged  in  a computer  system or  part  of  a  computer  system  or continues to  use  a 
computer  system  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by  imprisonment  for  a  period  not 
exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 
(2) A country may decide not to criminalize the mere unauthorized remaining provided that other effective 
remedies are available. Alternatively a country may require that the offence be committed by infringing 
security measures or with the intent of obtaining computer data or other dishonest intent. 
 
The provision, which is not contained in similar form in any of the regional approaches, reflects the fact 
that the integrity of a computer system can be violated not only by entering a computer system without 
right but also by remaining in the computer system after authorization has expired. Remaining requires 
that the offender still has access to the computer system. This can be the case, for example, if he/she 
remains  logged  on  or  continues  to  undertake  operations.  The  fact  that  he/she  has  the  theoretical 
possibility  to  log  on  to  the  computer  system  is  not  sufficient.  Section  54  requires  that  the  offender  is 
carrying  out  the  offences  intentionally.  Reckless  acts  are  not  covered.  In  addition,  Section  54  only 
criminalizes acts if they are committed “without lawful excuse or justification”. 

Illegal acquisition of computer data  

6.2.3 
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  as  well  as  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law  and  the 
Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  provide  legal  solutions  for  illegal  interception  only.1462 It  is 
questionable whether Article 3 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime applies to other cases 
than those where offences are carried out by intercepting data-transfer processes. As noted below,1463 the 
question of whether illegal access to information stored on a hard disk is covered by the Convention on 
Cybercrime  was  discussed  with  great  interest.1464 Since  a  transfer  process  is  needed,  it  is  likely  that 
Article 3  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  cover  forms  of  data  espionage  other  than  the 
interception  of  transfer  processes.1465 This  is  in  so  far  interesting  as  the  9th  Draft  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime mentioned the relevance of criminalizing data espionage.  
One  issue  frequently  discussed  in  this  context  is  the  question  whether  the  criminalization  of  illegal 
accesses  renders  the  criminalization  of  data  espionage  unnecessary.  In  cases  where  the  offender  has 
legitimate access to a computer system (e.g. because he/she is ordered to repair it) and on this occasion 
(in violation of the limited legitimation) copies files from the system, the act is in general not covered by 
the provisions criminalizing illegal access.1466  
Given  that  much  vital  data  are  now  stored  in  computer  systems,  it  is  essential  to  evaluate  whether 
existing mechanisms to protect data are adequate or whether other criminal law provision are necessary 
to protect the user from data espionage.1467 Today, computer users can use various hardware devices and 
software tools in order to protect secret information. They can install firewalls and access-control systems 
or encrypt stored information and thereby decrease the risk of data espionage.1468 Although user-friendly 

182 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
devices are available, requiring only limited knowledge by users, truly effective protection of data on a 
computer  system  often  requires  knowledge  that  few  users  have.1469 Data  stored  on  private  computer 
systems, in particular, are often not adequately protected against data espionage. Criminal law provisions 
can therefore offer an additional protection.  
Some  countries  have  decided  to  extend the  protection  that  is  available  through technical  measures  by 
criminalizing data espionage. There are two main approaches. Some countries follow a narrow approach 
and  criminalize  data  espionage  only  where  specific  secret  information  is  obtained  –  an  example  is 
18 USC § 1831, which criminalizes economic espionage. The provision does not only cover data espionage, 
but other ways of obtaining secret information as well. 

United States Code 
 
§ 1831 – Economic espionage 
(a)  In  General  –  Whoever,  intending  or  knowing  that  the  offense  will  benefit  any  foreign  government, 
foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent, knowingly: 
 

(1)  steals,  or  without  authorization  appropriates,  takes,  carries  away,  or  conceals,  or  by  fraud, 
artifice, or deception obtains a trade secret; 
(2)  without  authorization  copies,  duplicates,  sketches,  draws,  photographs,  downloads,  uploads, 
alters, destroys, photocopies, replicates, transmits, delivers, sends, mails, communicates, or conveys 
a trade secret; 
(3)  receives,  buys,  or  possesses  a  trade  secret,  knowing  the  same  to  have  been  stolen  or 
appropriated, obtained, or converted without authorization; 
(4) attempts to commit any offense described in any of paragraphs (1) through (3); or 
(5) conspires with one or more other persons to commit any offense described in any of paragraphs 
(1) through (3), and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, 
shall, except as provided in subsection (b), be fined not more than $500 000 or imprisoned not more 
than 15 years, or both. 

 

 

 
 

(b) Organizations – Any organization that commits any offense described in subsection (a) shall be fined 
not more than $10 000 000. 
 
This § 1831 was introduced by the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.1470 Until 1996, economic espionage 
was only criminalized under largely inconsistent state laws.1471 The Economic Espionage Act criminalizes 
two  types  of  trade  secret  misappropriation  in  Title  18  –  theft  of  a  trade  secret  to  benefit  a  foreign 
government, instrumentality, or agent; and commercial theft of trade secrets carried out for economic 
advantage, whether or not it benefits a foreign government, instrumentality, or agent.1472 Although the 
provision  focuses  on  the  protection  of  content  (trade  secrets)  and  does  not  require  a  specific  format 
(computer  data),  it  is  not  only  relevant  with  regard  to  traditional  crime  but  also  computer-related 
offences.1473 In  general,  18  U.S.C.  § 1030(a)(2)  is  also  applicable  in  such  cases. 1474 With  regard  to 
computer-related cases, the acts are covered by § 1831(a)(2)-(5). 

HIPCAR Cybercrime Legislative Text 
Another example is section 8 of the HIPCAR1475 cybercrime legislative text.1476  
 
Data Espionage 
8. (1) A person who, intentionally without lawful excuse or justification or in excess of a lawful excuse or 
justification obtains, for himself or for another, computer data which are not meant for him and which are 
specially  protected  against  unauthorized  access,  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by 
imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 
(2) A country may limit the criminalization to certain categories of computer data. 
 
Section  8  protects  the  secrecy  of  stored  and  protected  computer  data.  The  special  protection requires 
that the hoster of the information has implemented protection measures that significantly increase the 

 

183 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
difficulty of obtaining access to the data without authorization. Examples are password protection and 
encryption. The Explanatory Notes to the legislative text point out that it is necessary that the protection 
measures  go  beyond  standard  protection  measures  that  apply  to  data  as  well  as  other  property,  for 
example access restrictions to certain parts of government buildings.1477 

German Penal Code 
A similar approach can be found in section 202a of the German Penal Code in the version in force until 
2007.1478  
 
Section 202a. – Data Espionage: 
(1) Any person who obtains without authorization, for himself or for another, data which are not meant 
for him and which are specially protected against unauthorized access, shall be liable to imprisonment for 
a term not exceeding three years or to a fine 
(2) Data within the meaning of subsection 1 are only such as are stored or transmitted electronically or 
magnetically or in any form not directly visible. 
 
This provision covers not only economic secrets, but stored computer data in general.1479 In terms of its 
objects of protection, this approach is broader compared to 18 USC § 1831 Economic espionage, but the 
application of the provision is limited since obtaining data is only criminalized where data are specially 
protected  against  unauthorized  access.1480 The  protection  of  stored  computer  data  under  German 
criminal law is thus limited to persons or businesses that have taken measures to avoid falling victim to 
such offences.1481 

Relevance of such provisions 
The implementation of such provision is especially relevant with regard to cases where the offender was 
authorized to access a computer system (e.g. because he/she was ordered to fix a computer problem) and 
then abused the authorization to illegally obtain information stored on the computer system.1482 Having 
regard to the fact that the permission covers access to the computer system, it is in general not possible 
to cover such cases with provisions criminalizing the illegal access. 

Without right 
The application of data-espionage provisions generally requires that the data were obtained without the 
consent of the victim. The success of phishing attacks1483 clearly demonstrates the success of scams based 
on the manipulation of users.1484 Due to the consent of the victim, offenders who succeed in manipulating 
users  to  disclose  secret  information  cannot  be  prosecuted  on  the  basis  of  the  above-mentioned 
provisions.  

Illegal interception 

6.2.4 
The use of ICTs is accompanied by several risks related to the security of information transfer.1485 Unlike 
classic  mail-order  operations  within  a  country,  data-transfer  processes  over  the  Internet  involve 
numerous  providers  and  different  points  where  the  data  transfer  process  could  be  intercepted.1486 The 
weakest point for intercept remains the user, especially users of private home computers, who are often 
inadequately protected against external attacks. As offenders generally always aim for the weakest point, 
the risk of attacks against private users is great, all the more so given: 

• 
• 

the development of vulnerable technologies; and  
the increasing relevance of personal information for offenders.  

New  network  technologies  (such  as  “wireless  LAN”)  offer  several  advantages  for  Internet  access.1487 
Setting up a wireless network in a private home, for example, allows families to connect to the Internet 
from anywhere inside a given radius, without the need for cable connections. But the popularity of this 
technology and resulting comfort is accompanied by serious risks to network security. If an unprotected 

184 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
wireless  network  is  available,  perpetrators  can  log  on  to  this  network  and  use  it  for  criminal  purposes 
without the need to get access to a building. They simply need to get inside the radius of the wireless 
network  to  launch  an  attack.  Field  tests  suggest  that  in  some  areas  as  many  as  50  per  cent  of  private 
wireless networks are not protected against unauthorized interception or access.1488 In most cases, lack of 
protection arises from a lack of knowledge as to how to configure protection measures.1489 
In  the  past,  perpetrators  concentrated  mainly  on  business  networks  for  illegal  interceptions. 1490 
Interception of corporate communications was more likely to yield useful information than interception of 
data  transferred  within  private  networks.  The  rising  number  of  identity  thefts  of  private  personal  data 
suggests  that  the  focus  of  the  perpetrators  may  have  changed.1491 Private  data  such  as  credit-card 
numbers, social-security numbers1492, passwords and bank account information are now of great interest 
to offenders.1493  

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  protecting  the  integrity  of  non-
public transmissions by criminalizing their unauthorized interception. This provision aims to equate the 
protection of electronic transfers with the protection of voice conversations against illegal tapping and/or 
recording that currently already exists in most legal systems.1494  

The provision 

Article 3 – Illegal interception 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the interception without right, made by 
technical  means,  of  non-public  transmissions  of  computer  data  to,  from  or  within  a  computer  system, 
including electromagnetic emissions from a computer system carrying such computer data. A Party may 
require that the offence be committed with dishonest intent, or in relation to a computer system that is 
connected to another computer system. 

The acts covered 

The  applicability  of  Article 3  is  limited  to  the  interception  of  transmissions  realized  by  technical 
measures.1495 Interceptions related to electronic data can be defined as any act of acquiring data during a 
transfer process. 1496  
As mentioned above, the question whether illegal access to information stored on a hard disk is covered 
by  the  provision  is  controversial  and  much  discussed.1497 In  general,  the  provision  only  applies  to  the 
interception  of  transmissions  –  access  to  stored  information  is  not  considered  as  an  interception  of  a 
transmission.1498 The  fact  that  the  application  of  the  provision  is  discussed  even  in  cases  where  the 
offender physically accesses a standalone computer system partly arises as a result of the fact that the 
Convention does not contain a provision related to data espionage,1499 and the Explanatory Report to the 
Convention contains two slightly imprecise explanations with regard to the application of Article 3: 
The Explanatory Report first of all points out that the provision covers communication processes taking 
place within a computer system.1500 However, this still leaves open the question of whether the provision 
should only apply in cases where victims send data that are then intercepted by offenders or whether it 
should  apply  also  when  the  offender  operates  the  computer.  The  second  point  is  related  to  the 
criminalization of illegal acquisition of computer data.  
The  guide  points  out  that  interception  can  be  committed  either  indirectly  through  the  use  of  tapping 
devices or “through access and use of the computer system”.1501 If offenders gain access to a computer 
system and use it to make unauthorized copies of stored data on an external disc drive, whereby the act 
leads  to  a  data  transfer  (sending  data  from  the  internal  to  the  external  hard  disc),  this  process  is  not 
intercepted, but rather initiated, by offenders. The missing element of technical interception is a strong 
argument against the application of the provision in cases of illegal access to stored information.1502  

 

185 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The term “transmission” covers all data transfers, whether by telephone, fax, e-mail or file transfer.1503 
The  offence  established  under  Article 3  applies  only  to  non-public  transmissions.1504 A  transmission  is 
“non-public”,  if  the  transmission  process  is  confidential.1505 The  vital  element  to  differentiate  between 
public  and  non-public  transmissions  is  not  the  nature  of  the  data  transmitted,  but  the  nature  of  the 
transmission process itself. Even the transfer of publicly available information can be considered criminal, 
if the parties involved in the transfer intend to keep the content of their communications secret. Use of 
public networks does not exclude “non-public” communications. 

Mental element 

Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 3 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1506 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain 
a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.  In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  pointed  out  that 
“intentionally” should be defined at national level.1507  

Without right 

The  interception  of  communication  can  only  be  prosecuted  under  Article 3  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime, if it happens “without right”. 1508 The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime provided a set 
of  examples  for  interceptions  that  are  not  carried  out  without  right.  These  include  action  on  the  basis 
instructions or by authorization of the participants of the transmission,1509 authorized testing or protection 
activities agreed to by the participants1510 and lawful interception on the basis of criminal law provisions 
or in the interests of national security.1511  
Another issue raised within the negotiation of the Convention on Cybercrime was the question whether 
the use of cookies would lead to criminal sanctions based on Article 3.1512 The drafters pointed out that 
common commercial practices (such as cookies) are not considered to be interceptions without right.1513  

Restrictions and reservations: 
Article 3  offers  the  option  of  restricting  criminalization  by  requiring  additional  elements  listed  in  the 
second sentence, including a “dishonest intent” or relation to a computer system connected to another 
computer system. 

Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer related Crime 
A similar approach can be found in section 8 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1514 
 
Illegal interception of data etc. 
8. A person who, intentionally without lawful excuse or justification, intercepts by technical means: 
 
 

(a) any non-public transmission to, from or within a computer system; or 
(b) electromagnetic emissions from a computer system that are carrying computer data; commits 
an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a fine 
not exceeding [amount], or both. 

 
Section  8  follows  an  approach  that  is  similar  to  Article  3  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime.  Like  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  the  provision  protects  data  during  non-public 
transmission processes.  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The  informal1515 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (the  “Stanford  Draft”)  does  not  explicitly 
criminalize the interception of computer data.  

186 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Data interference 

 
6.2.5 
The protection of tangible, or physical, objects against intentional damage is a classic element of national 
penal  legislation.  With  continuing  digitization,  more  critical  business  information  is  stored  as  data.1516 
Attacks or obtaining of this information can result in financial losses.1517 Besides deletion, the alteration of 
such  information  could  also  have  major  consequences.1518 Previous  legislation  has  in  some  cases  not 
completely brought the protection of data in line with the protection of tangible objects. This has enabled 
offenders to design scams that do not lead to criminal sanctions.1519  

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
In  Article 4,  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  that  protects  the 
integrity of data against unauthorized interference.1520 The aim of the provision is to fill existing gaps in 
some national penal laws and to provide computer data and computer programs with protections similar 
to those enjoyed by tangible objects against the intentional infliction of damage.1521 

The provision: 
 
Article 4 – Data interference 
(1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences  under  its  domestic  law,  when  committed  intentionally,  the  damaging,  deletion,  deterioration, 
alteration or suppression of computer data without right. 
(2) A Party may reserve the right to require that the conduct described in paragraph 1 result in serious 
harm. 

The acts covered 
Article 4 criminalizes five different acts. The terms “damaging” and “deterioration” mean any act related 
to  the  negative  alteration  of  the  integrity  of  information  content  of  data  and  programs.1522 “Deleting” 
covers  acts  where  information  is  removed  from  storage  media  and  is  considered  comparable  to  the 
destruction  of  a  tangible  object.  While  providing  the  definition,  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime did not differentiate between the various ways data can be deleted.1523 Dropping a file to the 
virtual trash bin does not remove the file from the hard disk.1524 Even “emptying” the trash bin does not 
necessarily remove the file.1525 It is therefore uncertain if the ability to recover a deleted file hinders the 
application  of  the  provision.1526 “Suppression”  of  computer  data  denotes  an  action  that  affects  the 
availability of data to the person with access to the medium, where the information is stored in a negative 
way.1527 The  application  of  the  provision  is  especially  discussed  with  regard  to  denial-of-service1528 
attacks.1529 During  such  an  attack,  the  data  provided  on  the  targeted  computer  system  are  no  longer 
available to potential users or to the owner of the computer system.1530 The term “alteration” covers the 
modification  of  existing  data,  without  necessarily  lowering  the  serviceability  of  the  data. 1531 This  act 
covers  especially  the  installation  of  malicious  software  like  spyware,  viruses  or  adware  on  the  victim’s 
computer.1532 

Mental element 
Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 4 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1533 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain 
a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.  In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  pointed  out  that 
“intentionally” should be defined at national level.1534  

Without right 
Similarly to the provisions discussed above, the acts must be committed “without right”.1535 The right to 
alter data was discussed, especially in the context of “remailers”.1536 Remailers are used to modify certain 
data  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  anonymous  communications.1537 The  Explanatory  Report  mentions 

 

187 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
that, in principle, these acts are considered a legitimate protection of privacy and can thus be considered 
as being undertaken with authorization.1538  

Restrictions and reservations 
Article 4 offers the option of restricting criminalization by limiting it to cases where serious harm arises, a 
similar approach to the EU Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems,1539 which 
enables Member States to limit the applicability of the substantive criminal law provision to “cases which 
are not minor”.1540  

Commonwealth Computer and Computer related Crimes Model Law  
An approach in line with Article 4 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in 
section 8 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1541  

(a) destroys or alters data; or 
(b) renders data meaningless, useless or ineffective; or 
(c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use of data; or 
(d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in the lawful use of data; or 
(e) denies access to data to any person entitled to it; 

The provision 
 
Interfering with data 
6.  (1)  A  person  who,  intentionally  or  recklessly,  without  lawful  excuse  or  justification,  does  any  of  the 
following acts: 
 
 
 
 
 
commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a 
fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 
(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the person’s act is of temporary or permanent effect. 
 
The  first  main  difference  between  section  6  and  the  corresponding  provision  in  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime is the fact that this provision of the Commonwealth Model Law, in addition to intentional acts, 
even  criminalizes  reckless  acts.  Unlike  section  6,  three  other  provisions  of  the  Model  Law1542,  like  the 
Convention  on  Cybercrime,  limit  the  criminalization  to  intentional  acts.  The  coverage  of  recklessness 
significantly  broadens  the  approach,  since  even  the  unintentional  deletion  of  files  from  a  computer 
system or damage of a storage device will lead to criminal sanctions.  
The second difference is the fact that the acts covered by section 6 vary slightly from the corresponding 
provision in the Convention on Cybercrime. Finally, the provision contains a clarification in subsection 2 
that the acts do not require permanent effect, but even temporary effects are covered.  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The informal1543 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (“Stanford Draft”) contains two provisions 
that criminalize acts related to interference with computer data.  

The provision 
 
Art. 3 
1. Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any 
of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent: 
 

(a) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data 
or programs in a cybersystem with the purpose of causing, or knowing that such activities would 
cause,  said  cybersystem  or  another  cybersystem  to  cease  functioning  as  intended,  or  to  perform 
functions or activities not intended by its owner and considered illegal under this Convention; 

188 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

(b) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data 
in a cybersystem for the purpose and with the effect of providing false information in order to cause 
substantial damage to persons or property. 

The acts covered 
The main difference between the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth 
Model Law on the one hand, and the approach of the Stanford Draft on the other, is that the Stanford 
Draft only criminalizes interference with data if it interferes with the functioning of a computer system 
(Article  3,  paragraph  1a)  or  if  the  act  is  committed  with  the  purpose  of  providing  false  information  in 
order  to  cause  damage  to  a  person  or  property  (Article  3,  paragraph  1b).  Therefore,  Therefore,  the 
Stanford Draft does not criminalize the deletion of a regular text document from a data storage device as 
this  neither  influences  the  functioning  of  a  computer  nor  provides  false  information.  The  Council  of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth Model Law both adopt a broader approach, 
protecting the integrity of computer data without the mandatory requirement of further effects.  

System interference 

6.2.6 
People  or  businesses  offering  services  based  on  ICTs  depend  on  the  functioning  of  their  computer 
systems.1544 The  lack  of  availability  of  webpages  that  are  victim  to  denial-of-service  (DOS)  attacks1545 
demonstrates how serious the threat of attack is.1546 Attacks like these can cause serious financial losses 
and affect even powerful systems.1547 Businesses are not the only targets. Experts around the world are 
currently  discussing  possible  “cyberterrorism”  scenarios  that  take  into  account  attacks  against  critical 
infrastructures such as power supplies and telecommunication services. 1548  

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
To protect access of operators and users to ICTs, the Convention on Cybercrime includes a provision in 
Article 5 that criminalizes the intentional hindering of lawful use of computer systems.1549  

The provision 
 
Article 5 – System interference 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the 
functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or 
suppressing computer data. 

The acts covered 
The application of the provision requires that the functioning of a computer system has been hindered.1550 
Hindering  means  any  act  interfering  with  the  proper  functioning  of  the  computer  system.1551 The 
application  of  the  provision  is  limited  to  cases  where  hindering  is  carried  out  by  one  of  the  acts 
mentioned.  In  addition,  the  provision  requires  that  the  hindering  is  “serious”.  It  is  the  parties’ 
responsibility  to  determine  the  criteria  to  be  fulfilled  in  order  for  the  hindering  to  be  considered  as 
serious.1552 Possible restrictions under national law could include a minimum amount of damage, as well 
as limitation of criminalization to attacks against important computer systems.1553 
The list of acts by which the functioning of the computer system is adversely affected is conclusive.1554  
Inputting is defined neither by the Convention on Cybercrime itself, nor by the drafters of the Convention 
on Cybercrime. Given that transmitting is mentioned as an additional act in Article 5, the term “inputting” 
could  be  defined  as  any  act  related  to  use  of  physical  input  interfaces  to  transfer  information  to  a 
computer system, whereas the term “transmitting” covers acts that entail the remote input of data.1555 

 

189 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The terms “damaging” and “deteriorating” overlap and are defined by the drafters of the Convention on 
Cybercrime in the Explanatory Report with regard to Article 4 as negative alteration of the integrity of 
information content of data and programs.1556  
“Deleting” was also defined by the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime in the Explanatory Report 
with regard to Article 4, and covers acts where information is removed from storage media.1557  
The  term  “alteration”  covers  the  modification  of  existing  data,  without  necessarily  lowering  the 
serviceability of the data. 1558  
“Suppression” of computer data denotes an action that adversely affects the availability of data to the 
person with access to the medium where the information is stored.1559  

Application of the provision with regard to SPAM 
It was discussed whether the problem of SPAM e-mail1560 could be addressed under Article 5, since spam 
can  overload  computer  systems.1561 The  drafters  stated  clearly  that  spam  may  not  necessarily  lead  to 
“serious”  hindering  and  that  “conduct  should  only  be  criminalized  where  the  communication  is 
intentionally  and  seriously  hindered”.1562 The  drafters  also  noted  that  parties  may  have  a  different 
approach  to  hindrance  under  their  own  national  legislation,1563 e.g.  by  making  acts  of  interference 
administrative offences or subject to sanction.1564  

Mental elemen 
Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 5 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1565 This includes the intent to carry out one of listed 
acts as well as the intention to seriously hinder the functioning of a computer system.  
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  contain  a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.  In  the 
Explanatory Report, the drafters pointed out “intentionally” should be defined at national level.1566  

Without right 
The act needs to be carried out “without right”.1567 As mentioned previously, network administrators and 
security companies testing the protection of computer systems were afraid of the possible criminalization 
of their work.1568 These professionals work with the permission of the owner and therefore act legally. In 
addition, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly mentioned that testing the security of a 
computer system based on the authorization of the owner is not without right.1569 

Restrictions and reservations 
Unlike  Article 2-4,  Article 5  does  not  contain  an  explicit  possibility  of  restricting  the  application  of  the 
provision  implementation  in  national  law.  Nevertheless,  the  responsibility  of  the  parties  to  define  the 
gravity of the offence gives them the possibility to adjust the criminalization during the implementation 
process.  A  similar  approach  can  be  found  in  the  European  Union  Framework1570 Decision  on  Attacks 
against Information Systems.1571  

Commonwealth Computer and Computer related Crimes Model Law  
An approach in line with Article 5 of the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in 
section 7 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1572  

190 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

(a) hinders or interferes with the functioning of a computer system; or 
(b) hinders or interferes with a person who is lawfully using or operating a computer system; 

 
The provision 
 
Sec Interfering with computer system  
7. (1) A person who intentionally or recklessly, without lawful excuse or justification: 
 
 
commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a 
fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 
In subsection (1) “hinder”, in relation to a computer system, includes but is not limited to: 
 
 
 
 
 
The main difference with the corresponding provision in the Council of Europe Convention is the fact that, 
based  on  section  7  of  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law,  even  reckless  acts  are  criminalized.  Even 
unintentional  cutting  of  electricity  supply  during  construction  work  can  therefore  lead  to  criminal 
sanctions. With this approach, the Model Law even goes beyond the requirements of the Convention on 
Cybercrime.  Another  difference  is  the  fact  that  the  definition  of  “hindering”  in  section  7  of  the 
Commonwealth  Model  Law  lists  more  acts  than  Article 5  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime.  

(a) cutting the electricity supply to a computer system; and 
(b) causing electromagnetic interference to a computer system; and 
(c) corrupting a computer system by any means; and 
(d) inputting, deleting or altering computer data; 

European Union Coucnil Framework Decision on attacks against information systems 
The EU Council Framework Decision adopts a similar approach and criminalizes illegal data interference in 
Article 3. 
 
Article 3 – Illegal system interference 
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the intentional serious hindering or 
interruption of the functioning of an information system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, 
deteriorating,  altering,  suppressing  or  rendering  inaccessible  computer  data  is  punishable  as  a  criminal 
offence when committed without right, at least for cases which are not minor. 
 
The approach is based on the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The first main difference is 
that, in addition to the acts covered by the Convention on Cybercrime (inputting, transmitting, damaging, 
deleting, deteriorating, altering and suppressing), Article 3 also criminalizes hindering the functioning of 
an  information  system  by  rendering  computer  data  inaccessible.  Data  are  rendered  inaccessible  if,  by 
committing the act, the offender prevents someone from gaining access to them. Yet despite the more 
complex  list  of  acts  in  Article  3,  there  is  no  difference  with  the  corresponding  article  in  the  Council  of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime insofar as rendering inaccessible is covered by the act of suppressing 
computer data. The explanation to the 19th draft version of the Convention on Cybercrime highlights that 
the expert group which drafted the Convention on Cybercrime agreed that the term suppression of data 
has  two  meanings:  the  deletion  of  data  so  they  no  longer  physically  exist,  and  rendering  data 
inaccessible.1573  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The informal1574 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (“Stanford Draft”) contains a provision that 
criminalizes acts related to interference with computer systems.  

The provision 
 

 

191 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Art.3 
1. Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any 
of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent: 
 

(a) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data 
or programs in a cyber system with the purpose of causing, or knowing that such activities would 
cause, said cyber system or another cyber system to cease functioning as intended, or to perform 
functions or activities not intended by its owner and considered illegal under this Convention; 

The acts covered 
The main difference between the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the Commonwealth 
Model Law and the approach of the Stanford Draft is the fact that Stanford Draft covers any manipulation 
of  computer  systems  while  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  and  the  Commonwealth 
Model Law limit criminalization to the hindering of the functioning of a computer system.  

Erotic or pornographic material  

6.2.7 
The  criminalization  and  gravity  of  criminalization  of  illegal  content  and  sexually-explicit  content  varies 
between  countries.1575 The  parties  that  negotiated  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime 
focused  on  the  harmonization  of  laws  regarding  child  pornography  and  excluded  the  broader 
criminalization  of  erotic  and  pornographic  material.  Some  countries  have  addressed  this  problem  by 
implementing  provisions  that  criminalize  the  exchange  of  pornographic  material  through  computer 
systems.  However,  the  lack  of  standard  definitions  makes  it  difficult  for  law-enforcement  agencies  to 
investigate those crimes, if offenders act from countries that have not criminalized the exchange of sexual 
content.1576  

Examples 
One  example  of  the  criminalization  of  the  exchange  of  pornographic  material  is  Section  184  of  the 
German Penal Code. 
 
Section 184 Dissemination of Pornographic Writings  
(1) Whoever, in relation to pornographic writings (Section 11 subsection (3)):  
 
 

1. offers, gives or makes them accessible to a person under eighteen years of age;  
2.  displays,  posts,  presents  or  otherwise  makes  them  accessible  at  a  place  accessible  to  persons 
under eighteen years of age, or into which they can see;  
3. offers or gives them to another in retail trade outside of the business premises, in kiosks or other 
sales  areas  which  the  customer  usually  does  not  enter,  through  a  mail-order  business  or  in 
commercial lending libraries or reading circles;  
3a.  offers  or  gives  them  to  another  by  means  of  commercial  rental  or  comparable  commercial 
furnishing for use, except for shops which are not accessible to persons under eighteen years of age 
and into which they cannot see;  
4. undertakes to import them by means of a mail-order business;  
5. publicly offers, announces, or commends them at a place accessible to persons under eighteen 
years of age or into which they can see, or through dissemination of writings outside of business 
transactions through normal trade outlets;  
6. allows another to obtain them without having been requested to do by him;  
7. shows them at a public film showing for compensation requested completely or predominantly 
for this showing;  
8. produces, obtains, supplies, stocks, or undertakes to import them in order to use them or copies 
made  from  them  within  the  meaning  of  numbers  1  through  7  or  to  make  such  use  possible  by 
another; or  
9. undertakes to export them in order to disseminate them or copies made from them abroad in 
violation of the applicable penal provisions there or to make them publicly accessible or to make 
such use possible, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine. 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

192 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
This provision is based on the concept that trade and other exchange of pornographic writings should not 
be  criminalized,  if  minors  are  not  involved.1577 On  this  basis,  the  law  aims  to  protect  the  undisturbed 
development of minors.1578 Whether access to pornography has a negative impact on the development of 
minors is controversial and much discussed.1579 The exchange of pornographic writings among adults is 
not criminalized by Section 184. The term “writing” covers not only traditional writings, but also digital 
storage.1580 Equally,  making  them  “accessible”  not  only  applies  to  acts  beyond  the  Internet,  but  covers 
cases where offenders make pornographic content available on websites.1581  
One example of an approach that goes beyond this and criminalizes any sexual content is Section 4.C.1, 
Philippines draft House Law Bill No. 3777 of 2007.1582  
 
Sec. 4.C1.: Offenses Related to Cybersex – Without prejudice to the prosecution under Republic Act No. 
9208 and Republic Act No. 7610, any person who in any manner advertises, promotes, or facilitates the 
commission of cybersex through the use of information and communications technology such as but not 
limited to computers, computer networks, television, satellite, mobile telephone, […] 
Section  3i.:  Cybersex  or  Virtual  Sex  –  refers  to  any  form  of  sexual  activity  or  arousal  with  the  aid  of 
computers or communications network  
 
This  provision  follows  a  very  broad  approach,  as  it  criminalizes  any  kind  of  sexual  advertisement  or 
facilitation  of  sexual  activity  carried  out  over  the  Internet.  Due  to  the  principle  of  dual  criminality,1583 
international investigations with regard to such broad approaches run into difficulties.1584  

Child pornography 

6.2.8 
The  Internet  is  becoming  the  main  instrument  for  the  trade  and  exchange  of  material  containing  child 
pornography.1585 The major reasons for this development are the speed and efficiency of the Internet for 
file transfers, its low production and distribution costs and perceived anonymity.1586 Pictures placed on a 
webpage can be accessed and downloaded by millions of users worldwide.1587 One of the most important 
reasons for the “success” of webpages offering pornography or even child pornography is the fact that 
Internet users feel less observed while sitting in their home and downloading material from the Internet. 
Unless  the  users  have  used  means  of  anonymous  communication,  the  impression  of  no  traceability  is 
wrong.1588 Most Internet users are simply unaware of the electronic trail they leave while surfing.1589  
The provisions criminalizing child pornography are designed in general to protect different legal interests. 
Criminalization  of  the  production  of  child  pornography  seeks  to  protect  children  from  falling  victim  to 
sexual  abuse.1590 With  regard  to  the  prohibition  of  acts  related  to  the  exchange  of  child  pornography 
(offering, distributing) as well as possession, criminalization is intended to destroy the market, insofar as 
ongoing  demand  for  new  material  could  motivate  offenders  to  continue  the  abuse  of  children.1591 In 
addition, the prohibition  of  exchange  seeks  to  make  it  more  difficult  for  people to  gain access  to  such 
material  and  thereby  prevent  a  trigger  effect  on  sexual  abuse  of  children.  Finally,  criminalization  of 
possession intends to prevent offenders from using child-pornography material to seduce children into 
getting involved in sexual intercourse.1592 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
In  order  to  improve  and  harmonize  the  protection  of  children  against  sexual  exploitation,1593 the 
Convention on Cybercrime includes an article addressing child pornography. 

The provision: 
 
Article 9 – Offences related to child pornography 
(1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct: 
 
 

a) producing child pornography for the purpose of its distribution through a computer system; 
b) offering or making available child pornography through a computer system; 

 

193 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

a) a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; 
b) a person appearing to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; 
c) realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. 

c) distributing or transmitting child pornography through a computer system; 
d) procuring child pornography through a computer system for oneself or for another person; 
e) possessing child pornography in a computer system or on a computer-data storage medium. 

 
 
 
 
(2)  For  the  purpose  of  paragraph  1  above,  the  term  “child  pornography”  shall  include  pornographic 
material that visually depicts: 
 
 
 
(3) For the purpose of paragraph 2 above, the term “minor” shall include all persons under 18 years of age. 
A Party may, however, require a lower age-limit, which shall be not less than 16 years. 
4) Each Party may reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraphs 1, sub-paragraphs d. and 
e, and 2, sub-paragraphs b. and c. 
 
Most countries already criminalize the abuse of children, as well as traditional methods of distribution of 
child  pornography.1594 The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  thus  not  limited  to  closing  gaps  in  national 
criminal law1595 – it also seeks to harmonize differing regulation.1596  

The acts covered 
“Production” describes any process of creating child pornography. There is an ongoing discussion on the 
interpretation  of  the  term.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  download  of  child  pornography  images  is 
considered  as  production  (“making”)  of  child  pornography.1597 The  distinction  between  “procuring”  and 
“producing” in Article 9 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime indicates that the drafter of 
the  Convention  did  not  consider  the  mere  download  of  child  pornography  as  production.  Even  on  the 
basis  of  the  distinction  drawn  in  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  however,  further  differentiation  is 
required.  An  offender  taking  pictures  of  a  child  being  abused  is  producing  child  pornography;  but  it  is 
uncertain whether a person who uses child-pornography pictures to put them together in an animation is 
similarly  producing  child  pornography.  While  he/she  is  certainly  the  producer  of  the  animation,  it  is 
uncertain  whether  the  term  “production”  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  only 
applicable if it is documentation of an actual abuse of a child. The fact that the Convention on Cybercrime 
intends  to  criminalize  the  production  of  fictive  child  pornography  –  which  does  not  require  the  actual 
abuse of a child – is an argument in favour of a broad interpretation of the term “production”. On the 
other  hand,  the  Explanatory  Report  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  indicates  that  criminalization  of 
production is required to combat the danger “at the source”.1598 While the Council of Europe Convention 
on Cybercrime does not specify that intention of the drafters, the Explanatory Report to the Council of 
Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children1599 provides  a  more  specific  explanation  of  the 
motivation  of  the  drafters  with  regard  to  a  similar  provision.1600 The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  the 
Protection  of  Children  highlighted  that  criminalization  of  the  production  of  child  pornography  is 
“necessary  to  combat  acts  of  sexual  abuse  and  exploitation  at  their  source”.  This  can  be  seen  as  an 
argument in favour or a narrower approach.  
It  is  necessary  that  the  production  of  child  pornography  be  carried  out  for  the  purpose  of  distribution 
through a computer system. If the offender produces the material for his own use, or intends to distribute 
it in non-electronic form, Article 9 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is not applicable. 
Another problem discussed in the context of production is coverage of auto-depiction.1601 If the offender, 
from a distance, convinces a child to take pornographic pictures of himself/herself this could, depending 
on the national legislation, lead to criminalization of the victim (the child) and not the offender.  
“Offering”  covers  the  act  of  soliciting  others  to  obtain  child  pornography.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the 
material be offered on a commercial basis, but it implies that the offender offering the material is capable 
of  providing  it.1602 “Making  available”  refers  to  an  act  that  enables  other  users  to  gain  access  to  child 
pornography. The act can be committed by placing child pornography on websites or connecting to file-
sharing systems and enabling others to access such material in unblocked storage capacities or folders.  

194 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
“Distribution”  covers  active  acts  of  forwarding  child  pornography  to  others.  “Transmitting”  covers  all 
communication by means of transmitted signals. “Procuring” for oneself or for another covers any act of 
actively obtaining child pornography.  
Article 9  finally  criminalizes  “possessing”  child  pornography.  The  criminalization  of  possession  of  child 
pornography also differs between national legal systems.1603 Demand for such material could result in its 
production  on  an  ongoing  basis.1604 Possession  of  such  material  could  encourage  the  sexual  abuse  of 
children, so drafters suggest that one effective way to curtail the production of child pornography is to 
make possession illegal.1605 However, the Convention enables the parties, in paragraph 4, to exclude the 
criminalization of mere possession, by restricting criminal liability to the production, offer and distribution 
of  child  pornography.1606 Possession  involves  the  control  a  person  intentionally  exercises  towards  child 
pornography. It requires that the offender have control, which is not only the case with regard to local 
storage  devices  but  also  remote  storage  devices  which  he/she  can  access  and  control.  Furthermore, 
possession in general requires a mental element as stated in the definition above.  

Child pornography 
Article 9, paragraph 2, provides three subsections on material that visually depicts child pornography: a 
minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, a person appearing to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit 
conduct and realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. The fact that a 
visual depiction is required excludes audio files.  
Although the drafters sought to improve the protection of children against sexual exploitation, the legal 
interests covered by paragraph 2 are broader. Paragraph 2(a) focuses directly on protection against child 
abuse.  Paragraphs 2(b)  and 2(c)  cover  images  that  were  produced  without  violating  children’s  rights, 
e.g. images  that  have  been  created  through  the  use  of  3D  modelling  software.1607 The  reason  for  the 
criminalization of fictive child pornography is the fact that these images can, without necessarily creating 
harm to a “real child”, be used to seduce children into participating in such acts.1608 
One of the main challenges related to the definition is the fact that it focuses on visual depiction. Child 
pornography is not necessary distributed as pictures or movies, but also as audio files.1609 Due to the fact 
that the provision provided in Article 9 refers to “material that visually depicts” a child, the provision does 
not  cover  audio  files.  As  a  consequence,  more  recent  approaches  such  as  the  HIPCAR1610 cybercrime 
legislative text1611 adopt a different approach and avoid the term “visually”.  
 
Definitions 
3. 
[…] 
(4) Child pornography means pornographic material that depicts presents or represents: 
 
 
 
 
A country may restrict the criminalisation by not implementing (b) and (c). 

a) a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct;  
b) a person appearing to be a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or 
c) images representing a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct; 
this includes, but is not limited to, any audio, visual or text pornographic material. 

Another broader definition can be found in Article 2 c) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. 
 
Article 2 
For the purpose of the present Protocol: 
[…] 
 
 
 

(c) Child pornography means any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged 
in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts 
of a child for primarily sexual purposes. 

 

195 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
One  of  the  most  important  differences  between  national  legislation  is  the  age  of  the  person  involved. 
Some states define the term “minor” in relation to child pornography in their national law in accordance 
with  the  definition  of  a  “child”  in  Article 1  of  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child1612 as  all 
persons less than 18 years old. Other countries define minors as a person under 14 years old.1613 A similar 
approach is found in the 2003 EU Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of 
children  and  child  pornography1614 and  the  2007  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  protection  of 
children  against  sexual  exploitation  and  sexual  abuse.1615 Emphasizing  the  importance  of  a  uniform 
international standard regarding age, the Convention on Cybercrime defines the term according to the UN 
Convention.1616 However,  in  recognition  of  the  huge  differences  in  the  existing  national  laws,  the 
Convention on Cybercrime permits parties to require a different age limit of not lower than 16 years. One 
problem  that  is  more  and  more  frequently  debated  is  potentially  unintended  criminalization  in  cases 
where  the  age  of  sexual  consent  and  the  age-limit  within  the  definition  differ.1617 If,  for  example,  child 
pornography is defined as visual depiction of sexual acts of a person below the age of 18 and at the same 
time the age of sexual consent is 16, two 17 year old children can legally have a sexual relationship but 
will be committing a serious crime (production of child pornography) if they take pictures or movies of 
this act.1618  

Mental element 
Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 9 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1619 In the Explanatory Report, the drafters explicitly 
pointed  out  that  interaction  with  child  pornography  without  any  intention  is  not  covered  by  the 
Convention  on  Cybercrime.  Lack  of  intention  can  be  relevant  especially  if  the  offender  accidentally 
opened a webpage with child pornography images and despite the fact that he/she immediately closed 
the website some images were stored in temp-folders or cache-files.  

Without right 
The  acts  related  to  child  pornography  can  only  be  prosecuted  under  Article 9  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime if they are carried out “without right”.1620 The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime did 
not further specify in which cases the user is acting with authorization. In general, the act is not carried 
out “without right” only if members of law-enforcement agencies are acting within an investigation.  

Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children 
Another approach to criminalize acts related to child pornography is Article 20 of the Council of Europe 
Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.1621  

The provision 
 
Article 20 – Offences concerning child pornography 
(1)  Each  Party  shall  take  the  necessary  legislative  or  other  measures  to  ensure  that  the  following 
intentional conduct, when committed without right, is criminalised: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

a) producing child pornography;   
b) offering or making available child pornography; 
c) distributing or transmitting child pornography; 
d) procuring child pornography for oneself or for another person; 
e) possessing child pornography; 
f)  knowingly  obtaining  access,  through  information  and  communication  technologies,  to  child 
pornography. 

(2)  For  the  purpose  of  the  present  article,  the  term  “child  pornography”  shall  mean  any  material  that 
visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of a child’s 
sexual organs for primarily sexual purposes. 
(3)  Each  Party  may  reserve  the  right  not  to  apply,  in  whole  or  in  part,  paragraph  1.a  and  e  to  the 
production and possession of pornographic material: 

196 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
 

– consisting exclusively of simulated representations or realistic images of a non-existent child; 
– involving children who have reached the age set in application of Article 18, paragraph 2, where 
these  images  are  produced  and  possessed  by  them  with  their  consent  and  solely  for  their  own 
private use. 

(4) Each Party may reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraph 1.f 

The acts covered 
The provision is based on Article 9 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and therefore to a 
large  degree  comparable  to  this  provision.1622 The  main  difference  is  the  fact  that  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime  focuses  on  the  criminalization  of  acts  related  to  information  and  communication  services 
(“producing child pornography for the purpose of its distribution through a computer system”) while the 
Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  mainly  takes  a  broader  approach  (“producing  child 
pornography”) and even covers acts that are not related to computer networks.  
Despite the similarities with regard to the acts covered, Article 20 of the Convention on the Protection of 
Children contains one act that is not covered by the Convention. Based on Article 20, paragraph 1f) of the 
Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children,  the  act  of  obtaining  access  to  child  pornography  through  a 
computer  is  criminalized.  Obtaining  access  covers  any  act  of  initiating  the  process  of  displaying 
information made available through ICTs. This is the case, for example, if the offender enters the domain 
name of a known child-pornography website and initiates the process of receiving the information from 
the  first  page which  involves  a  necessary  automated  download  process.  It  enables  law-enforcement 
agencies to prosecute offenders in cases where they are able to prove that the offender opened websites 
with child pornography but are unable to prove that the offender downloaded material. Such difficulties 
in  collecting  evidence  do,  for  example,  arise  if  the  offender  is  using  encryption  technology  to  protect 
downloaded files on his storage media.1623 The Explanatory Report to the Convention on the Protection of 
children points out that the provision should also be applicable in cases where the offender only watches 
child  pornography  pictures  online  without  downloading  them. 1624  In  general,  opening  a  website 
automatically  initiates  a  download  process  –  often  without  the  knowledge  of  the  user.1625 The  case 
mentioned in the Explanatory Report is therefore only relevant in those cases where a download in the 
background is not taking place. But it is also applicable in cases where consumption of child pornography 
can  take  place  without  download  of  material.  This  can,  for  example,  occur  if  the  website  enables 
streaming videos and, due to the technical configuration of the streaming process, does not buffer the 
received  information  but  discards  it  straight  after  transmission  (e.g. if  the  offender  is  using  video 
streaming). 

Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law 
An approach in line with Article 9 of the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in 
section 10 of the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1626  
 
Child pornography  
10 (1) A person who, intentionally, does any of the following acts: 
 
 
 

(a) publishes child pornography through a computer system; or 
(b) produces child pornography for the purpose of its publication through a computer system; or 
(c)  possesses  child  pornography  in  a  computer  system  or  on  a  computer  data  storage  medium; 
commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], 
or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.1627 

(2) It is a defence to a charge of an offence under paragraph (1) (a) or (1)(c) if the person establishes that 
the child pornography was a bona fide scientific, research, medical or law enforcement purpose.1628 
(3) In this section: 
“child pornography” includes material that visually depicts: 
 
(a) a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or 
(b) a person who appears to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or 
 
 
(c) realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. 

 

197 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

“minor” means a person under the age of [x] years. 

 
 
“publish” includes: 
 

(a) distribute, transmit, disseminate, circulate, deliver, exhibit, lend for gain, exchange, barter, sell 
or offer for sale, let on hire or offer to let on hire, offer in any other way, or make available in any 
way; or 
(b) have in possession or custody, or under control, for the purpose of doing an act referred to in 
paragraph (a); or 
(c) print, photograph, copy or make in any other manner (whether of the same or of a different kind 
or nature) for the purpose of doing an act referred to in paragraph (a). 

 

 

 
The  main  differences  with  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  the  fact  that  the 
Commonwealth Model Law does not provide a fixed definition of the term “minor” and leaves it to the 
Member  States  to  define  the  age-limit.  Like  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  the 
Commonwealth Model Law does not provide for criminalization of obtaining access to child pornography 
through information technology.  

Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
A technology-neutral approach can be found in Article 3 of the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, 
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  
 
Article 3 
1 . Each State Party shall ensure that, as a minimum, the following acts and activities are fully covered 
under its criminal or penal law, whether these offences are committed domestically or transnationally or 
on an individual or organized basis: 
[...] 
 

(c)  Producing,  distributing,  disseminating,  importing,  exporting,  offering,  selling  or  possessing  for 
the above purposes child pornography as defined in Article 2. 

[...] 

 

While  the  Optional  Protocol  does  explicitly  refer  to  the  role  of  the  Internet  in  distributing  such 
material, 1629 it  criminalizes  acts  related  to  child  pornography  in  a  technology-neutral  way.  Child 
pornography is defined as any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated 
explicit  sexual  activities,  or  any  representation  of  the  sexual  parts  of  a  child  for  primarily  sexual 
purposes.1630 The acts covered are comparable to the acts covered in the Convention on Cybercrime, with 
the exception that the provision in Article 3 was drafted so as to be technology neutral. 

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The informal1631 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (the “Stanford Draft”) does not contain any 
provision criminalizing the exchange of child pornography through computer systems. The drafters of the 
Stanford Draft pointed out that in general no type of speech or publication is to be treated as criminal 
under the Stanford Draft.1632 Recognizing different national approaches, the drafters of the Stanford Draft 
left it to the states to decide about this aspect of criminalization.1633 

Solicitation of children 

6.2.9 
The Internet offers the possibility of communicating with others without disclosing one’s age or gender. 
This  ability  can  be  abused  by  offenders  to  solicit  children.1634 The  phenomenon  is  frequently  called 
“grooming”.1635 Some regional legal frameworks contain provisions criminalizing such contact. 

Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children 
One  example  is  Article 23  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  against 
Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.1636  

198 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
Article 23 – Solicitation of children for sexual purposes 
Each Party shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to criminalise the intentional proposal, 
through information and communication technologies, of an adult to meet a child who has not reached 
the age set in application of Article 18, paragraph 2, for the purpose of committing any of the offences 
established in accordance with Article 18, paragraph 1.a, or Article 20, paragraph 1.a, against him or her, 
where this proposal has been followed by material acts leading to such a meeting. 
 
The  solicitation  of  a  child  for  the  purpose  of  sexually  abusing  the  child  is  in  general  not  covered  by 
provisions criminalizing the sexual abuse of children, insofar as the solicitation is considered a preparatory 
act. Having regard to the increasing debate on online grooming, the drafters of the Convention decided to 
include Article 23 to criminalize already preparatory acts.1637 To avoid over-criminalization, the drafter of 
the Convention underlined that simple sexual chatting with a child should not be considered sufficient for 
committing the act of solicitation, although this can be part of the preparation of a sexual abuse.1638  
The are two main problems related to this approach. First, the provision only covers solicitation through 
ICTs. Other forms of solicitation are not covered by the provision. The drafters expressed the view that 
the focus on such technologies is justified since they are difficult to monitor.1639 However, no scientifically 
reliable data were provided to demonstrate that the solicitation of children is a mere online problem. In 
addition,  there  are  good  reasons  not  only  to  avoid  situations  where  something  that  is  illegal  when 
committed offline is legal when committed online, but also, conversely, to make sure not to criminalize 
conduct online when it is legal offline. The 2001 Joint Declaration on Challenges to Freedom of Expression 
in the New Century, for example, points out that states should not adopt separate rules limiting Internet 
content.1640 
Another problem with the criminalization of this preparatory act is the fact that it might lead to conflicts 
in the criminal law system, insofar as the preparation of even more serious acts is not covered. It would 
challenge a country’s value system if the preparation of sexual abuse of a child were to be criminalized, 
while the preparation of murder of a child was not. Therefore, any such approach should be formulated 
within an overall discussion of the advantages and risks of the criminalization of preparatory acts.  

6.2.10  Hate speech, racism  
The  degree  of  criminalization  of  hate  speech  differs  significantly.1641 Especially  in  countries  with  strong 
constitutional protection of freedom of speech,1642 hate speech is often not criminalized. Prohibitions can 
be found especially in Africa and Europe.1643 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Additional Protocol) 
The Council of Europe is playing an active role in the fight against racism, and after the Vienna Summit in 
1993  adopted  a  Declaration  and  Action  Plan  on  Combating  Racism,  Xenophobia,  Anti-Semitism  and 
Intolerance.1644 In  1995,  the  Council  of  Europe  adopted  recommendations  on  fighting  racism.1645 During 
the  negotiation  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  the  criminalization  of  online  hate 
speech and racism was discussed. Since the parties negotiating the Convention on Cybercrime could not 
agree1646 on a common position on the criminalization of hate speech and xenophobic material, provisions 
related to these offences were integrated into a separate First Protocol to the Convention.1647 One of the 
main difficulties of provisions criminalizing xenophobic material is to keep a balance between ensuring 
freedom of speech1648 on the one hand and preventing the violation of the rights of individuals or groups 
on the other hand. Without going into detail, the difficulties in the negotiation of the Council of Europe 
Convention on Cybercrime1649 and the status of the signatures/ratifications of the Additional Protocol1650 
demonstrate  that  the  different  extent  of  the  protection  of  freedom  of  speech  is  hindering  a 
harmonization process.1651 Especially with regard to the common principle of dual criminality,1652 lack of 
harmonization leads to difficulties in enforcement in cases with an international dimension.1653  

 

199 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The provision 

 

Article 3 – Dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct: 
distributing,  or  otherwise  making  available,  racist  and  xenophobic  material  to  the  public  through  a 
computer system. 
2. A Party may reserve the right not to attach criminal liability to conduct as defined by paragraph 1 of this 
article,  where  the  material,  as  defined  in  Article  2,  paragraph  1,  advocates,  promotes  or  incites 
discrimination that is not associated with hatred or violence, provided that other effective remedies are 
available.  
3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of this article, a Party may reserve the right not to apply paragraph 1 to 
those  cases  of  discrimination  for  which,  due  to  established  principles  in  its  national  legal  system 
concerning  freedom  of  expression,  it  cannot  provide  for  effective  remedies  as  referred  to  in  the  said 
paragraph 2. 
Article 4 – Racist and xenophobic motivated threat 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct: 
threatening,  through  a  computer  system,  with  the  commission  of  a  serious  criminal  offence  as  defined 
under  its  domestic  law,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group,  distinguished  by  race, 
colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors, 
or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics. 
Article 5 – Racist and xenophobic motivated insult 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct: 
insulting  publicly,  through  a  computer  system,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group 
distinguished by race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext 
for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics. 
2. A Party may either: 
 

a. require that the offence referred to in paragraph 1 of this article has the effect that the person or 
group of persons referred to in paragraph 1 is exposed to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or 
b. reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraph 1 of this article. 

 
Article 6 – Denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative measures as may be necessary to establish the following conduct 
as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right: 
distributing  or  otherwise  making  available,  through  a  computer  system  to  the  public,  material  which 
denies, grossly minimises, approves or justifies acts constituting genocide or crimes against humanity, as 
defined  by  international  law  and  recognised  as  such  by  final  and  binding  decisions  of  the  International 
Military Tribunal, established by the London Agreement of 8 August 1945, or of any other international 
court established by relevant international instruments and whose jurisdiction is recognised by that Party. 
2. A Party may either 
 

a.  require  that  the  denial  or  the  gross  minimisation  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  article  is 
committed  with  the  intent  to  incite  hatred,  discrimination  or  violence  against  any  individual  or 
group of individuals, based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion if 
used as a pretext for any of these factors, or otherwise 
b. reserve the right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraph 1 of this article. 

 

 

The acts covered: 
Article 3  criminalizes  the  intentional  distribution  and  making  available  of  xenophobic  material  to  the 
public through a computer system.1654 Consequently, traditional ways of distribution that do not involve 
computer  systems  (like  books  and  magazines)  are  not  covered.  Based  on  the  definition  provided  by 
Article 2,  racist  and  xenophobic  material  is  any  written  material,  image  or  any  other  representation  of 
ideas  or  theories  which  advocates,  promotes  or  incites  hatred,  discrimination  or  violence,  against  any 

200 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
individual or group of individuals, based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as 
religion  if  used  as  a  pretext  for  any  of  these  factors.  “Distribution”  means  the  active  dissemination  of 
material.1655 “Making available” covers the act of placing material online.1656 It requires that users can gain 
access to the material. The act can be committed by placing material on websites or connecting to file-
sharing systems and enabling others to access such material in unblocked storage capacities or folders. 
The Explanatory Report points out that also the creation or compilation of hyperlinks should be covered. 
1657 Since hyperlinks only facilitate the access to material, such an interpretation goes beyond the text of 
the  provision.  Distribution  covers  active  acts  of  forwarding  racist  or  xenophobic  material  to  others. 
Criminalization requires in addition that the distribution and making available include an interaction with 
the public, and thereby excludes private communication.1658 
Article 6 follows a similar approach to Article 3, criminalizing distributing or making available, through a 
computer  system  to  the  public,1659 material  which  denies,  grossly  minimizes,  approves  or  justifies  acts 
constituting genocide or crimes against humanity, as defined by international law and recognized as such 
by final and binding decisions of the International Military Tribunal, established by the London Agreement 
of  8 August  1945,  or  of  any  other  international  court  established by  relevant  international  instruments 
and whose jurisdiction is recognized by that Party. 
Article 4 criminalizes threatening persons, through a computer system, with the commission of a serious 
criminal  offence,  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group,  distinguished  by  race,  colour,  descent  or 
national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, or a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these 
characteristics. It refers to threats which create fear in the persons at whom they are directed that they 
will suffer the commission of an offence.1660 The term “threatening”, unlike Article 3, does not require any 
interaction with the public and therefore also covers sending out e-mails to the victim. 
Article 5  adopts  a  similar  approach  to  Article 4,  criminalizing  insulting  persons  for  the  reason  that  they 
belong to a group distinguished by race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if 
used as a pretext for any of these factors, or a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these 
characteristics. “Insulting” refers to any offensive or invective expression which prejudices the dignity of a 
person and is directly connected with the insulted person’s belonging to the group. To avoid conflict with 
the  principle  of  freedom  of  speech,1661 it  is  necessary  to  define  the  act  of  insult  narrowly.  The  main 
difference  between  Article 4  and  Article 5  is  the  fact  that the  provision  only  requires  publicly  insulting, 
and therefore excludes private communication (such as e-mail).1662 

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The informal1663 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention (the “Stanford Draft”) does not include a 
provision criminalizing hate speech. The drafters of the Stanford Draft pointed out that in general no type 
of speech, or publication, is to be treated as criminal under the Stanford Draft.1664 Recognizing different 
national approaches, the drafters of the Stanford Draft left it to the states to decide about this aspect of 
criminalization.1665  

6.2.11  Religious offences  
The intensity of the protection of religions and their symbols differs between countries.1666 A number of 
concerns are expressed with regard to criminalization. It is pointed out in the 2006 Joint Declaration of 
the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE Representative on Freedom 
of  the  Media  and  the  OAS  Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Expression  that  in  “many  countries, 
overbroad  rules  in  this  area  are  abused  by  the  powerful  to  limit  non-traditional,  dissenting,  critical,  or 
minority  voices,  or  discussion  about  challenging  social  issues”.1667 The  2008  Joint  Declaration  highlights 
that  international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  and  Human  Rights 
Council,  should  resist  from  the  further  adoption  of  statements  supporting  the  idea  of  criminalizing 
defamation of religions.

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Additional Protocol) 
Negotiations  on  this  topic  among  the  parties  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  encountered  the  same 
difficulties that were discovered with regard to xenophobic material.1668 Nonetheless, the countries that 
negotiated the provisions for the First Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime agreed to add 
religion as a subject of protection in two provisions. 

The provisions 
 
Article 4 – Racist and xenophobic motivated threat 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the following conduct: 
threatening,  through  a  computer  system,  with  the  commission  of  a  serious  criminal  offence  as  defined 
under  its  domestic  law,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that  they  belong  to  a  group,  distinguished  by  race, 
colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors, 
or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics. 
Article 5 – Racist and xenophobic motivated insult 
1. 

 Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  establish  as 
criminal  offences  under  its  domestic  law,  when  committed  intentionally  and  without  right,  the 
following  conduct:  insulting  publicly,  through  a  computer  system,  (i)  persons  for  the  reason  that 
they belong to a group distinguished by race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as 
religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished 
by any of these characteristics. 
[…] 

 
 
Although these two provisions treat religion as a characteristic, they do not protect religion or religious 
symbols through criminalization. The provisions criminalize threats and insults to people for the reason 
that they belong to a group.  

Examples from national legislation 
Some  countries  go  beyond  this  approach  and  further  criminalize  acts  related  to  religious  issues.  One 
example is section 295B to section 295C of the Pakistani Penal Code. 
 
295-B. Defiling, etc., of Holy Qur’an: Whoever wilfully defiles, damages or desecrates a copy of the Holy 
Qur’an or of an extract therefrom or uses it in any derogatory manner or for any unlawful purpose shall be 
punishable with imprisonment for life.  
295-C. Use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet: Whoever by words, either spoken or 
written, or by visible representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, 
defiles  the  sacred  name  of  the  Holy  Prophet  Muhammad  (peace  be  upon  him)  shall  be  punished  with 
death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.  
 
With  regard  to  uncertainties  regarding  the  application  of  this  provision,  the  draft  of  the  Pakistan 
Electronic Crime Bill 2006 had contained two provisions that focused on Internet-related offences,1669 but 
those provisions were deleted when the bill was reintroduced as the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 
in 2007,1670 proclaimed in December 2007.1671  
  
20. Defiling etc, of copy of Holy Quran – Whoever, using any electronic system or electronic device wilfully 
defiles,  damages  or  desecrates  a  copy  of  the  Holy  Quran  or  of  an  extract  there  from  or  uses  it  in  any 
derogatory manner or for any unlawful purpose shall be punished with imprisonment of life. 

202 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
21. Use of derogatory remarks etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet – Whoever, using any electronic system 
or electronic device by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, or by any imputation, 
innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Mohammed 
(peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life and shall be liable to fine. 

 

As with provisions criminalizing the distribution of xenophobic material via the Internet, one of the main 
challenges of global approaches criminalizing religious offences is the principle of freedom of speech.1672 
As pointed out previously, the different extent of protection of freedom of speech is a hindrance for the 
harmonization process.1673 Especially with regard to the common principle of dual criminality,1674 the lack 
of harmonization leads to difficulties in enforcement in cases with an international dimension.1675 

Illegal gambling  

6.2.12 
The  growing  number  of  websites  offering  illegal  gambling  is  a  concern,1676 as  they  can  be  used  to 
circumvent the prohibition on gambling in force in some countries.1677 If services are operated from places 
that do not prohibit online gambling, it is difficult for countries that criminalize the operation of Internet 
gambling to prevent their citizens from using these services.1678  

Example from national legislation 
The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime does not contain a prohibition of online gambling. One 
example of a national approach in this regard is section 284 German Penal Code: 

Example 
 
Section 284 Unauthorized Organization of a Game of Chance  
(1) Whoever, without the permission of a public authority, publicly organizes or runs a game of chance or 
makes  the  equipment  therefore  available,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  for  not  more  than  two 
years or a fine.  
(2) Games of chance in clubs or private parties in which games of chance are regularly organized shall 
qualify as publicly organized.  
(3) Whoever, in cases under subsection (1), acts:  
 
 

1. professionally; or  
2. as a member of a gang which has combined for the continued commission of such acts, shall be 
punished with imprisonment from three months to five years.  

(4)  Whoever  recruits  for  a  public  game  of  chance  (subsections  (1)  and  (2)),  shall  be  punished  with 
imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine.  
 
The  provision  intends  to  limit  the  risks  of  addiction1679 to  gambling  by  defining  procedures  for  the 
organization  of  such  games.1680 It  does  not  explicitly  focus  on  Internet-related  games  of  chance,  but 
includes  them  as  well.1681 In  this  regard,  it  criminalizes  the  operation  of  illegal  gambling,  without  the 
permission  of  the  competent  public  authority.  In  addition,  it  criminalizes  anyone  who  (intentionally) 
makes equipment available that is then used for illegal gambling.1682 This criminalization goes beyond the 
consequences of aiding and abetting, as offenders can face higher sentences.1683  
To  avoid  criminal  investigations,  the  operator  of  illegal  gambling  websites  can  physically  move  their 
activities1684 to countries that do not criminalize illegal gambling.1685 Such move to locations is a challenge 
for  law-enforcement  agencies  because  the  fact  that  a  server  is  located  outside  the  territory  of  a 
country1686 does not in general affect the possibilities of users inside the country to access it.1687 In order 
to  improve  the  ability  of  law-enforcement  agencies  to  fight  against  illegal  gambling,  the  German 
Government  has  extended  the  criminalization  to  users.1688 Based  on  section 285,  law-enforcement 
agencies  can  prosecute  users  who  participate  in  illegal  gambling  and  can  initiate  investigations  even 
where operators of games of chance cannot be prosecuted, if they are located outside Germany: 
 

 

203 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Section 285 Participation in an Unauthorized Game of Chance  
Whoever participates in a public game of chance (Section 284) shall be punished with imprisonment for 
not more than six months or a fine of not more than one hundred eighty daily rates. 
 
If  offenders  use  gambling  sites  for  money-laundering  activities,  the  identification  of  offenders  is  often 
difficult.1689 One example of an approach1690 to prevent illegal gambling and money-laundering activities is 
the United States Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2005.1691  
 
§ 5363. Prohibition on acceptance of any financial instrument for unlawful Internet gambling  
No person engaged in the business of betting or wagering may knowingly accept, in connection with the 
participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling  
(1)  credit,  or  the  proceeds  of  credit,  extended  to  or  on  behalf  of  such  other  person  (including  credit 
extended through the use of a credit card);  
(2) an electronic fund transfer, or funds transmitted by or through a money transmitting business, or the 
proceeds  of  an  electronic  fund  transfer  or  money  transmitting  service,  from  or  on  behalf  of  such  other 
person;  
(3)  any  check,  draft,  or  similar  instrument  which  is  drawn  by  or  on  behalf  of  such  other  person  and  is 
drawn on or payable at or through any financial institution; or  
(4) the proceeds of any other form of financial transaction, as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation, 
which involves a financial institution as a payor or financial intermediary on behalf of or for the benefit of 
such other person.  
§ 5364. Policies and procedures to identify and prevent restricted transactions  
(a) Before the end of the 270-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this subchapter, the 
Secretary, in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Attorney 
General,  shall  prescribe  regulations  requiring  each  designated  payment  system,  and  all  participants 
therein,  to  identify  and  prevent  restricted  transactions  through  the  establishment  of  policies  and 
procedures  reasonably  designed  to  identify  and  prevent  restricted  transactions  in  any  of  the  following 
ways:  
 
 

(A)  allow  the  payment  system  and  any  person  involved  in  the  payment  system  to  identify 
restricted transactions by means of codes in authorization messages or by other means; and  
(B) block restricted transactions identified as a result of the policies and procedures developed 
pursuant to subparagraph (A).  

(1) The establishment of policies and procedures that  

(2)  The  establishment  of  policies  and  procedures  that  prevent  the  acceptance  of  the  products  or 
services of the payment system in connection with a restricted transaction.  

(b) In prescribing regulations under subsection (a) the Secretary shall  
 

(1)  identify  types  of  policies  and  procedures,  including  nonexclusive  examples,  which  would  be 
deemed, as applicable, to be reasonably designed to identify, block, or prevent the acceptance of 
the products or services with respect to each type of restricted transaction;  
(2) to the extent practical, permit any participant in a payment system to choose among alternative 
means  of  identifying  and  blocking,  or  otherwise  preventing  the  acceptance  of  the  products  or 
services of the payment system or participant in connection with, restricted transactions; and  
(3)  consider  exempting  restricted  transactions  from  any  requirement  imposed  under  such 
regulations,  if  the  Secretary  finds  that  it  is  not  reasonably  practical  to  identify  and  block,  or 
otherwise prevent, such transactions.  

(c) A financial transaction provider shall be considered to be in compliance with the regulations prescribed 
under subsection (a), if 
 

(1) such person relies on and complies with the policies and procedures of a designated payment 
system of which it is a member or participant to 

 

 

 

 

 
 

204 

(A) identify and block restricted transactions; or  
(B)  otherwise  prevent  the  acceptance  of  the  products  or  services  of  the  payment  system, 
member, or participant in connection with restricted transactions; and 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

(2) such policies and procedures of the designated payment system comply with the requirements of 
regulations prescribed under subsection (a).  

(d) A person that is subject to a regulation prescribed or order issued under this subchapter and blocks, or 
otherwise refuses to honor a transaction 
 
(1) that is a restricted transaction;  
(2) that such person reasonably believes to be a restricted transaction; or  
 
(3) as a member of a designated payment system in reliance on the policies and procedures of the 
 
payment system, in an effort to comply with regulations prescribed under subsection (a), shall not 
be liable to any party for such action. 

(e) The requirements of this section shall be enforced exclusively by the Federal functional regulators and 
the Federal Trade Commission, in the manner provided in section 505(a) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  
5366. Criminal penalties  
(a) Whoever violates section 5363 shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or 
both.  
(b) Upon conviction of a person under this section, the court may enter a permanent injunction enjoining 
such person from placing, receiving, or otherwise making bets or wagers or sending, receiving, or inviting 
information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers.  
 
The intention of the act is to address the challenges and threats of (cross-border) Internet gambling.1692 
The act contains two important regulations. First, it prohibits acceptance of any financial instrument for 
unlawful Internet gambling by any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering. This provision 
does not regulate action undertaken by the user of Internet gambling sites or financial institutions.1693 A 
violation  of  this  prohibition  can  lead  to  criminal  sanctions.1694 Second,  it  requires  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe regulations that require 
financial transaction providers to identify and block restricted transactions in connection with unlawful 
Internet gambling through reasonable policies and procedures. This second regulation applies not only to 
persons engaged in the business of betting or wagering, but to all financial institutions in general. Unlike 
the  acceptance  of  financial  instruments  for  unlawful  Internet  gambling  by  persons  engaged  in  the 
business of betting or wagering, financial institutions do not in general face criminal liability. With regard 
to the international impact of the regulation, potential conflicts with the General Agreement on Trade in 
Services (GATS)1695 are currently being investigated.1696  

6.2.13  Libel and defamation 
Libel and the publication of false information are not acts that are exclusively committed on networks. 
But  as  pointed  out  previously,  the  possibility  of  anonymous  communication1697 and  logistic  challenges 
related  to  the  huge  amount  of  available  information  in  the  Internet1698 are  abstract  parameters  that 
support those acts.  
The question whether this requires criminalization of defamation is controversial.1699 Concerns regarding 
the  criminalization  of  defamation  are  especially  related  to  potential  conflict  with  the  principle  of 
“freedom  of  speech”.  Thus,  a  number  of  organizations  have  called  for  a  replacement  of  criminal 
defamation  laws.1700 The  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Opinion  and  Expression  and  the  OSCE 
Representative on Freedom of the Media have stated: “Criminal defamation is not a justifiable restriction 
on  freedom  of  expression;  all  criminal  defamation  laws  should  be  abolished  and  replaced,  where 
necessary, with appropriate civil defamation laws”. 
Despite  these  concerns,  some  countries1701 have  implemented  criminal  law  provisions  that  criminalize 
libel, as well as the publication of false information. It is important to highlight that even in the countries 
that  criminalize  defamation  the  number  of  cases  varies  considerably.  While  in  the  United  Kingdom 
nobody  in  2004  and  just  one  suspect  in  2005  was  charged  with  libel,1702 the  German  crime  statistics 
record 187 527 defamation offences for 2006.1703 The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the 
Commonwealth Model Law and the Stanford Draft do not contain any provisions directly addressing these 
acts. 

 

205 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Example from national legislation 
One  example  of  a  criminal  law  provision  addressing  libel  is  section 365  of  the  Criminal  Code  of 
Queensland  (Australia).  Queensland  reintroduced  criminal  liability  for  defamation  by  the 2002  Criminal 
Defamation Amendment Bill 2002.1704  

The provision 
 
365 Criminal defamation1705  
(1)  Any  person  who,  without  lawful  excuse,  publishes  matter  defamatory  of  another  living  person  (the 
relevant person)—  
 

(a) knowing the matter to be false or without having regard to whether the matter is true or false; 
and  
(b) intending to cause serious harm to the relevant person or any other person or without having 
regard to whether serious harm to the relevant person or any other person is caused; commits a 
misdemeanour. Maximum penalty—3 years imprisonment.  

 

(2) In a proceeding for an offence defined in this section, the accused person has a lawful excuse for the 
publication of defamatory matter about the relevant person if, and only if, subsection (3) applies. […] 
 
Another example of the criminalization of libel is section 185 of the German Penal Code: 

The provision 
 
Section 185 Insult  
Insult  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  for  not  more  than  one  year  or  a  fine  and,  if  the  insult  is 
committed by means of violence, with imprisonment for not more than two years or a fine. 
 
Both provisions were not designed to cover Internet-related acts only. Their application is not limited to 
certain  means  of  communication,  so  it  can  cover  acts  committed  within  the  network,  as  well  as  acts 
committed outside the network.  

6.2.14  Spam 
Having regard to the fact that up to 75 per cent1706 of all e-mails are reported to be spam1707 e-mails, the 
need  for  criminal  sanctions  on  spam  e-mails  has  been  discussed  intensively.1708 National  legislative 
solutions  addressing  spam  differ.1709 One  of  the  main  reasons  why  spam  is  still  a  problem  is  that  filter 
technology  still  cannot  identify  and  block  all  spam  e-mails.1710 Protection  measures  offer  only  limited 
protection against unsolicited e-mails.  
In  2005,  OECD  published  a  report  that  analysed  the  impact  of  spam  for  developing  countries.1711 The 
report  points  out  that  representatives  from  developing  countries  often  express  the  view  that  Internet 
users in their countries are suffering much more from the impact of spam and net abuse. An analysis of 
the  results  of  the  report  proves  that  the  impression  of  the  representatives  is  right.  Due  to  the  more 
limited  and  more  expensive  resources,  spam  turns  out  to  be  a  much  more  serious  issue  in  developing 
countries than in western countries.1712  
However,  it  is  not  only  the  identification  of  spam  e-mail  that  poses  problems.  Distinguishing  between 
e-mails  that  are  unwanted  by  recipients,  but  sent  legally,  and  those  that  are  sent  unlawfully,  is  a 
challenge. The current trend towards computer-based transmission (including e-mail and VoIP) highlights 
the importance of protecting communications from attack. If spam exceeds a certain level, spam e-mails 
can seriously hinder the use of ICTs and reduce user productivity.  

206 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  explicitly  criminalize  spam.1713 The  drafters 
suggested that the criminalization of such acts should be limited to serious and intentional hindering of 
communication.1714 This approach does not focus on unsolicited e-mails, but on the effects on a computer 
system  or  network.  According  to  the  legal  approach  adopted  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime, the fight against spam can only be based on unlawful interference with computer networks 
and systems: 
 
Article 5 – System interference 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the serious hindering without right of the 
functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or 
suppressing computer data. 

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The informal1715 1999 Stanford Draft Convention does not include a provision criminalizing spam. Like the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the Stanford Draft only criminalizes spam if the unsolicited 
e-mails lead to intended system interference.  

HIPCAR Cybercrime Legislative Text 
One example of a specific approach is section 15 of the HIPCAR1716 Cybercrime legislative text:1717 
 
SPAM  
15. (1) A person who, intentionally, without lawful excuse or justification or in excess of a lawful excuse or 
justification: 
 

 a. initiates the transmission of multiple electronic mail messages from or through such computer 
system; or 
b. uses a protected computer system to relay or retransmit multiple electronic mail messages, with 
the intent to deceive or mislead users, or any electronic mail or Internet service provider, as to the 
origin of such messages, or 
c.  materially  falsifies  header  information  in  multiple  electronic  mail  messages  and  intentionally 
initiates  the  transmission  of  such  messages,  commits  an  offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by 
imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both. 

 

 

(2)  A  country  may  restrict  the  criminalization  with  regard  to  the  transmission  of  multiple  electronic 
messages within customer or business relationships. A country may decide not to criminalize the conduct 
in section 15 (1) (a) provided that other effective remedies are available. 

 
The  provision  contains  three  different  acts.  section 15  (1)  (a)  covers  the  process  of  initiating  the 
transmission of multiple electronic mails. section 3(14) defines multiple electronic mail messages as a mail 
message, including e-mail and instant messaging, sent to more than a thousand recipients. In this context, 
the Explanatory Note points out that the limitation of criminalization to acts carried out without lawful 
excuse  or  justification  plays  an  important  role  in  distinguishing  between  legitimate  mass  mailings  (like 
newsletters) and illegal spam.1718 Section 15 (1) (b) criminalizes the circumvention of anti-spam technology 
by abusing protected computer systems to relay or transmit electronic messages. Section 15 (1) (c) covers 
the  circumvention  of  anti-spam  technology  by  falsifying  header  information.  The  Explanatory  Note 
highlights  that  section 15  requires  that  the  offender  carries  out  the  offences  intentionally  and  without 
lawful excuse or justification. 1719  

United States Code 
This limits the criminalization of spam to those cases where the amount of spam e-mails has a serious 
impact on the processing power of computer systems. Spam e-mails which undermine the effectiveness 

 

207 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
of  commerce,  but  not  necessarily  the  computer  system,  cannot  be  prosecuted.  A  number  of  countries 
therefore take a different approach. One example is the United States legislation – 18 USC § 1037.1720  
 
§ 1037. Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail 
(a) In General – Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly – 
 

initiates  the 

intentionally 

(1)  accesses  a  protected  computer  without  authorization,  and 
transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from or through such computer, 
(2) uses a protected computer to relay or retransmit multiple commercial electronic mail messages, 
with the intent to deceive or mislead recipients, or any Internet access service, as to the origin of 
such messages, 
(3)  materially  falsifies  header  information  in  multiple  commercial  electronic  mail  messages  and 
intentionally initiates the transmission of such messages, 
(4) registers, using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant, for five 
or  more  electronic  mail  accounts  or  online  user  accounts  or  two  or  more  domain  names,  and 
intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any 
combination of such accounts or domain names, or 
(5)  falsely  represents  oneself  to  be  the  registrant  or  the  legitimate  successor  in  interest  to  the 
registrant of 5 or more Internet Protocol addresses, and intentionally initiates the transmission of 
multiple commercial electronic mail messages from such addresses, 
or conspires to do so, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b). 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(b) Penalties – The punishment for an offense under subsection (a) is– 
 
 

(1) a fine under this title, imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, if– 

(A) the offense is committed in furtherance of any felony under the laws of the United States or 
of any State; or 
(B) the defendant has previously been convicted under this section or section 1030, or under the 
law of any State for conduct involving the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail 
messages or unauthorized access to a computer system; 

 
The provision was implemented by the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.1721 The intention of the act was to create a 
single  national  standard  designed  to  control  commercial  e-mail.1722 It  applies  to  commercial  electronic 
messages, but not to messages relating to transactions and existing business relationships. The regulatory 
approach  requires  that  commercial  electronic  messages  include  an  indication  of  solicitation,  including 
opt-out instructions and the physical address of the sender.1723 18 USC. § 1037 criminalizes the senders of 
spam  e-mails  especially 
information  of  e-mails  to  circumvent  filter 
technology.1724 In addition, the provision criminalizes unauthorized access to a protected computer and 
initiation of the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages. 

if  they  falsify  the  header 

6.2.15  Misuse of devices 
Another  serious  issue  is  the  availability  of  software  and  hardware  tools  designed  to  commit crimes.1725 
Apart from the proliferation of “hacking devices”, the exchange of passwords that enables unauthorized 
users to access computer systems is a serious challenge.1726 The availability and potential threat of these 
devices makes it difficult to focus criminalization on the use of these tools to commit crimes only. Most 
national criminal law systems have some provision criminalizing the preparation and production of these 
tools, in addition to the “attempt of an offence”. One approach to fight against the distribution of such 
devices is criminalization of the production of the tools. In general, this criminalization – which usually 
accompanies extensive forward displacement of criminal liability – is limited to the most serious crimes. 
Especially  in  EU  legislation,  there  are  tendencies  to  extend  criminalization  of  preparatory  acts  to  less 
grave offences. 1727 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
Taking  into  account  other  Council  of  Europe  initiatives,  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime 
established an independent criminal offence for specific illegal acts regarding certain devices or access to 

208 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
data  to  be  misused  for  the  purposes  of  committing  offences  against  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and 
availability of computer systems or data:1728 

The provision 
 
Article 6 – Misuse of devices 
(1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right: 
 
 

(a) the production, sale, procurement for use, import, distribution or otherwise making available of: 
(i)  a  device,  including  a  computer  program,  designed  or  adapted  primarily  for  the  purpose of 
committing any of the offences established in accordance with the above Articles 2 through 5; 
(ii)  a  computer  password,  access  code,  or  similar  data  by  which  the  whole  or  any  part  of  a 
computer  system  is  capable  of  being  accessed,  with  intent  that  it  be  used  for  the  purpose  of 
committing any of the offences established in Articles 2 through 5; and  

 

 

(b) the possession of an item referred to in paragraphs a) i or ii above, with intent that it be used for 
the  purpose  of  committing  any  of  the  offences  established  in  Articles 2  through  5.  A  Party  may 
require by law that a number of such items be possessed before criminal liability attaches. 

(2)  This  article  shall  not  be  interpreted  as  imposing  criminal  liability  where  the  production,  sale, 
procurement  for  use,  import,  distribution  or  otherwise  making  available  or  possession  referred  to  in 
paragraph 1 of this article is not for the purpose of committing an offence established in accordance with 
Articles  2  through  5  of  this  Convention,  such  as  for  the  authorised  testing  or  protection  of  a  computer 
system. 
(3) Each Party may reserve the right not to apply paragraph 1 of this article, provided that the reservation 
does  not  concern  the  sale,  distribution  or  otherwise  making  available  of  the  items  referred  to  in 
paragraph 1 a.ii of this article. 

The objects covered 
Paragraph 1(a) identifies both the devices1729 designed to commit and promote cybercrime and passwords 
that enable access to a computer system. The term “devices” covers hardware as well as software-based 
solutions  to  commit  one  of  the  mentioned  offences.  The  Explanatory  Report  mentions  for  example 
software such as virus programs, or programs designed or adapted to gain access to computer systems.1730 
“Computer  password,  access  code,  or  similar  data”,  unlike  devices,  do  not  perform  operations,  but 
constitute access codes. One question discussed in this context is the question whether the publication of 
system vulnerabilities is covered by the provision.1731 Unlike classic access codes, system vulnerabilities do 
not necessarily enable immediate access to a computer system, but enable the offender to make use of 
the vulnerabilities to successfully attack a computer system.  

The acts covered 
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  criminalizes  a  wide  range  of  actions.  In  addition  to  production,  it  also 
sanctions  the  sale,  procurement  for  use,  import,  distribution  or  other  availability  of  devices  and 
passwords.  A  similar  approach  (limited  to  devices  designed  to  circumvent  technical  measures)  can  be 
found  in  EU  legislation  on  the  harmonization  of  copyrights, 1732 and  a  number  of  countries  have 
implemented  similar  provisions  in  their  criminal  law.1733 “Distribution”  covers  active  acts  of  forwarding 
devices or passwords to others.1734 In the context of Article 6, “sale” describes activities involved in selling 
the devices and passwords in return for money or other compensation. “Procurement for use” covers acts 
related to the active obtaining of passwords and devices.1735 The fact that the act of procuring is linked to 
the use of such tools generally requires intent on the part of the offender to procure the tools for a use 
that  goes  beyond  the  “regular”  intent,  i.e. “that  it  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  committing  any  of  the 
offences established in Articles 2 through 5”. “Import” covers acts of obtaining devices and access codes 
from foreign  countries.1736 As a result, offenders that import such tools to sell them can be prosecuted 
even  before  they  offer  the  tools.  Having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  procurement  of  such  tools  is  only 
criminalized if it can be linked to use, it is questionable whether the sole import without the intention to 
sell or use the tools is covered by Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. “Making 

 

209 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
available”  refers  to  an  act  that  enables  other  users  to  get  access  to  items.1737 The  Explanatory  Report 
suggests  that  the  term  “making  available”  is  also  intended  to  cover  the  creation  or  compilation  of 
hyperlinks in order to facilitate access to such devices. 1738  

Dual use tools 
Unlike the European Union approach to the harmonization of copyrights,1739 the provision does not only 
apply  to  devices  that  are  exclusively  designed  to  facilitate  committing  cybercrime;  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime also covers devices that are generally used for legal purposes, where the offenders’ specific 
intent is to commit cybercrime. In the Explanatory Report, the drafters suggested that the limitation to 
devices designed solely to commit crimes was too narrow and could lead to insurmountable difficulties of 
proof  in  criminal  proceedings,  rendering  the  provision  virtually  inapplicable  or  only  applicable  in  rare 
instances.1740  
To  ensure  the  proper  protection  of  computer  systems,  experts  use  and  possess  various  software  tools 
that  could  make  them  a  possible  focus  of  law  enforcement.  The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  addresses 
these  concerns  in  three  ways1741:  It  enables  the  parties  in  Article 6,  paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (b)  to 
make reservations regarding the possession of a minimum number of such items before criminal liability 
is  attributed.  Apart  from  this,  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  these  devices  is  limited  by  the 
requirement of intent to use the device to commit a crime as set out in Article 2 to 5 of the Convention on 
Cybercrime.1742 The  Explanatory  Report  points  out  that  this  special  intent  was  included  to  “avoid  the 
danger  of  over-criminalisation  where  devices  are  produced  and  put  on  the  market  for  legitimate 
purposes, e.g. to counter attacks against computer systems”.1743 Finally, the drafters of the Convention on 
Cybercrime clearly state in paragraph 2 that tools created for authorized testing or for the protection of a 
computer system are not covered by the provision, as the provision covers unauthorized acts.  

Criminalization of possession 
Paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (b)  takes  the  regulation  in  paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (a)  further,  by 
criminalizing  the  possession  of  devices  or  passwords,  if  linked  to  the  intent  to  commit  cybercrime. 
Criminalization  of  the  possession  of  tools  is  controversial.1744 Article 6  is  not  limited  to  tools  that  are 
designed  exclusively  for  committing  crimes,  and  opponents  of  criminalization  are  concerned  that 
criminalization  of  the  possession  of  these  devices  could  create  unacceptable  risks  for  system 
administrators  and  network-security  experts.1745 The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  enables  the  parties  to 
require that a certain number of such items be possessed before criminal liability attaches.  

Mental element 
Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 6 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1746 In addition to the regular intent with regard to 
the acts covered, Article 6 of the Convention on Cybercrime requires an additional specific intent that the 
device  is  used  for  the  purpose  of  committing  any  of  the  offences  established  in  Article 2-5  of  the 
Convention.1747  

Without right 
Similarly to the provisions discussed above, the acts must be committed “without right”.1748 With regard 
to  the  fears  that  the  provision  could  be  used  to  criminalize  the  legitimate  operation  of  software  tools 
under self-protection measures. the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that such acts 
are not considered as being carried out “without right”.1749  

Restrictions and reservations 
Due  to  the  debate  on  the  need  for  criminalization  of  the  possession  of  devices,  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime offers the option of a complex reservation in Article 6, paragraph 3 (in addition to paragraph 
1,  sub-paragraph  (b),  sentence  2).  If  a  Party  uses  this  reservation,  it  can  exclude  criminalization  of  the 

210 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
possession  of  tools  and  a  number  of  illegal  actions  under  paragraph  1,  sub-paragraph  (a),  e.g. in  the 
production of such devices.1750  

Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law 
An approach similar to Art. 6 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime can be found in Sec. 9 of 
the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.1751  
 
Illegal devices  
9.  
(1) A person commits an offence if the person: 
 

(a)  intentionally  or  recklessly,  without  lawful  excuse  or  justification,  produces,  sells,  procures  for 
use, imports, exports, distributes or otherwise makes available: 

(i)  a  device,  including  a  computer  program,  that  is  designed  or  adapted  for  the  purpose  of 
committing an offence against section 5, 6, 7 or 8; or 
(ii)  a  computer  password,  access  code  or  similar  data  by  which  the  whole  or  any  part  of  a 
computer system is capable of being accessed; 
with the intent that it be used by any person for the purpose of committing an offence against 
section 5, 6, 7 or 8; or 

 

 

 

 

(b) has an item mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) in his or her possession with the intent that it 
be used by any person for the purpose of committing an offence against section 5, 6, 7 or 8. 

(2) A person found guilty of an offence against this section is liable to a penalty of imprisonment for a 
period not exceeding [period], or a fine not exceeding [amount], or both.  
 
While the devices covered by the provision and the acts mentioned are the same, the main difference 
from  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  the  fact  that  the  Commonwealth  Model  Law 
criminalizes reckless acts in addition to intentional acts, while the Convention on Cybercrime requires an 
intention in all cases. During negotiation of the Commonwealth Model Law, further amendments to the 
provision  that  criminalize  the  possession  of  such  devices  were  discussed.  The  expert  group  suggested 
criminalization  of  offenders  possessing  more  than  one  item.1752 Canada  proposed  a  similar  approach 
without predefining the number of items that would lead to criminalization. 1753  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The  informal1754 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (“Stanford  Draft”)  includes  a  provision 
criminalizing acts related to certain illegal devices. 
 
Article 3 – Offenses 
1. Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any 
of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent: 
[...] 
 

(e) manufactures, sells, uses, posts, or otherwise distributes any device or program intended for the 
purpose of committing any conduct prohibited by Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention; 

 
The drafters of the Stanford Draft pointed out that in general no type of speech, or publication, is to be 
treated  as  criminal  under  the  Stanford  Draft.1755 The  only  exemption  they  make  relates  to  illegal 
devices.1756 In  this  context,  the  drafters  highlighted  that  criminalization  should  be  limited  to  the  acts 
mentioned and, for example, not cover the discussion of system vulnerabilities.1757  

HIPCAR Cybercrime Legislative Text 
An interesting approach can be found in the legislative text developed by the beneficiary states within the 
HIPCAR initiative.1758  
 

 

211

Illegal Devices  
10. 
[…] 
 (3) A country may decide not to criminalize the mere unauthorized access provided that other effective 
remedies are available. Furthermore, a country may decide to limit the criminalization to devices listed in a 
Schedule. 
 
In  order  to  prevent  over-criminalization,  the  drafter  decided  to  include  the  possibility  of  limiting  the 
criminalization by introducing a blacklist. In this case, only devices contained in the list are covered by the 
provision. Such an approach limits the risks of criminalizing acts that are desirable from the point of view 
of cybersecurity. However, maintaining such a list would very likely require significant resources.  

6.2.16  Computer-related forgery 
Criminal  proceedings  involving  computer-related  forgery  have  tended  to  be  rare,  because  most  legal 
documents  have  been  tangible  documents.  With  digitization,  this  situation  is  changing.1759 The  trend 
towards digital documents is supported by the creation of a legal background for their use, e.g. by the 
legal  recognition  of  digital  signatures.  In  addition,  provisions  against  computer-related  forgery  play  an 
important role in the fight against “phishing”.1760 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
Most  criminal  law  systems  criminalize  the  forgery  of  tangible  documents.1761 The  drafters  of  the 
Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that the dogmatic structures of national legal approaches vary.1762 
While one concept is based on the authenticity of the author of the documents another is based on the 
authenticity  of  the  statement.  The  drafters  decided  to  implement  minimum  standards  and  protect  the 
security  and  reliability  of  electronic  data  by  creating  a  parallel  offence  to  the  traditional  forgery  of 
tangible documents to fill gaps in criminal law that might not apply to electronically stored data.1763  

The provision 
 
Article 7 – Computer-related forgery 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the input, alteration, 
deletion,  or  suppression  of  computer  data,  resulting  in  inauthentic  data  with  the  intent  that  it  be 
considered or acted upon for legal purposes as if it were authentic, regardless whether or not the data is 
directly  readable  and  intelligible.  A  Party  may  require  an  intent  to defraud,  or  similar  dishonest  intent, 
before criminal liability attaches. 

The object covered 
The  target  of  a  computer-related  forgery  is  data  –  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  directly  readable 
and/or intelligible. Computer data is defined by the Convention on Cybercrime1764 as “any representation 
of  facts,  information  or  concepts  in  a  form  suitable  for  processing  in  a  computer  system,  including  a 
program suitable to cause a computer system to perform a function”. The provision does not only refer to 
computer data as the object of one of the acts mentioned. In addition, it is necessary that the acts result 
in inauthentic data.  
Article  7  requires  –  at  least  with  regard  to  the  mental  element  –  that  the  data  be  the  equivalent  of  a 
public  or  private  document.  This  means  that  data  must  be  legally  relevant:1765 the  forgery  of  data  that 
cannot be used for legal purposes is not covered by the provision.  

The acts covered 
The  “input”  of  data1766 must  correspond  to  the  production  of  a  false  tangible  document.1767 The  term 
“alteration”  refers  to  the  modification  of  existing  data.1768 The  Explanatory  Report  particularly  specifies 

212 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
variations and partial changes.1769 The term “suppression” of computer data denotes an action that affects 
the  availability  of  data.1770 In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  specifically  refer  to  holding  back  or 
concealment of data.1771 The act can for example be carried out by blocking certain information from a 
database during the automatic creation of an electronic document. The term “deletion” corresponds to 
the  definition  of  the  term  in  Article 4  covering  acts  where  information  is  removed.1772 The  Explanatory 
Report only refers to the removal of data from a data medium.1773 But the scope of the provision strongly 
supports a broader definition of the term “deletion”. Based on such a broad definition, the act can either 
be carried out by removing an entire file or by partly erasing information in a file.1774  

Mental element 
Like all other offences defined by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Article 3 requires that 
the offender is carrying out the offences intentionally.1775 The Convention on Cybercrime does not contain 
a  definition  of  the  term  “intentionally”.  In  the  Explanatory  Report,  the  drafters  pointed  out  that 
“intentionally” should be defined on a national level.1776  

Without right 
Acts  of  forgery  can  only  be  prosecuted  under  Article  7  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  if  they  occur 
“without right”. 1777  

Restrictions and reservations 
Article 7 also offers the possibility of making a reservation in order to limit criminalization, by requiring 
additional elements, such as the intent to defraud, before criminal liability arises.1778  

Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law 
The  2002  Commonwealth  Model  Law  does  not  contain  any  provision  criminalizing  computer-related 
forgery.1779  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The  informal1780 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  includes  a  provision  criminalizing  acts 
related to falsified computer data. 
 
Article 3 – Offenses 
1. Offenses under this Convention are committed if any person unlawfully and intentionally engages in any 
of the following conduct without legally recognized authority, permission, or consent: 
[...] 
 

(b) creates, stores, alters, deletes, transmits, diverts, misroutes, manipulates, or interferes with data 
in  a  cyber  system  for  the  purpose  and  with  the  effect  of  providing  false  information  in  order  to 
cause substantial damage to persons or property; 

[...] 
 
The main difference in relation to Article 7 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is the fact 
that  Article 3 1b)  does  not  focus  on  the  mere  manipulation  of  data,  but  requires  interference  with  a 
computer system. Article 7 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime does not require such an 
act; it is sufficient that the offender has acted with the intent that it be considered or acted upon for legal 
purposes as if it were authentic. 

Identity theft 

6.2.17 
Taking into consideration media coverage,1781 the results of recent surveys1782 and the numerous legal and 
technical  publications1783 in  this  field,  it  seems  appropriate  to  refer  to  identity  theft  as  a  mass 
phenomenon.1784 Despite the global aspects of the phenomenon, not all countries have yet implemented 

 

213 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
provisions  in  their  national  criminal  law  system  that  criminalize  all  acts  related  to  identity  theft.  The 
Commission  of  the  European  Union  (the  EC)  recently  stated  that  identity  theft  has  not  yet  been 
criminalized in all EU Member States.1785 The EC expressed its view that “EU law enforcement cooperation 
would be better served, were identity theft criminalised in all Member States” and announced that it will 
shortly commence consultations to assess whether such legislation is appropriate. 1786 
One of the problems with comparing the existing legal instruments in the fight against identity theft is the 
fact that they differ dramatically.1787 The only consistent element of existing approaches is the fact that 
the condemned behaviour relates to one or more of the following phases:1788  

•  Phase 1: Act of obtaining identity-related information. 
•  Phase 2: Act of possessing or transferring the identity-related information. 
•  Phase 3: Act of using the identity-related information for criminal purposes. 

Based on this observation, there are in general two systematic approaches to criminalize identity theft:  

•  The  creation  of  a  single  provision  that  criminalizes  the  act  of  obtaining,  possessing  and  using 

identity-related information (for criminal purposes).  

•  The individual criminalization of typical acts related to obtaining identity-related information (like 
illegal access, the production and dissemination of malicious software, computer-related forgery, 
data espionage and data interference) as well as acts related to the possession and use of such 
information (like computer-related fraud). 

Examples of single-provision approaches 
The  most  well-known  examples  of  single-provision  approaches  are  18  USC  § 1028(a)(7)  and 
18 USC 1028A(a)(1). The provisions cover a wide range of offences related to identity theft. Within this 
approach, criminalization is not limited to any given phase but covers all of the three above-mentioned 
phases.  Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  provision  does  not  cover  all  identity-theft 
related activities – especially not those where the victim and not the offender is acting.  
 
§ 1028. Fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features, 
and information 
 
 

(a) Whoever, in a circumstance described in subsection (c) of this section –  

(1) knowingly and without lawful authority produces an identification document, authentication 
feature, or a false identification document; 
(2)  knowingly  transfers  an 
identification  document,  authentication  feature,  or  a  false 
identification document knowing that such document or feature was stolen or produced without 
lawful authority; 
(3)  knowingly  possesses  with  intent  to  use  unlawfully  or  transfer  unlawfully  five  or  more 
identification documents (other 
than  those  issued  lawfully  for  the  use  of  the  possessor),  authentication  features,  or  false 
identification documents; 
(4) knowingly possesses an identification document (other than one issued lawfully for the use of 
the possessor), authentication feature, or a false identification document, with the intent such 
document or feature be used to defraud the United States; 
(5)  knowingly  produces, 
implement  or 
authentication  feature  with  the  intent  such  document-making  implement  or  authentication 
feature will be used in the production of a false identification document or another document-
making implement or authentication feature which will be so used; 
(6) knowingly possesses an identification document or authentication feature that is or appears 
to be an identification document or authentication feature of the United States which is stolen 
or  produced  without  lawful  authority  knowing  that  such  document  or  feature  was  stolen  or 
produced without such authority; 

transfers,  or  possesses  a  document-making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

214 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

 

 
 

(7) knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of 
another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any unlawful 
activity  that  constitutes  a  violation  of  Federal  law,  or  that  constitutes  a  felony  under  any 
applicable State or local law; or 
(8)  knowingly  traffics  in  false  or  actual  authentication  features  for  use  in  false  identification 
documents, document-making implements, or means of identification; 

shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
[…] 

 
§ 1028A. Aggravated identity theft 
 
 

(a) Offenses.– 

(1)  In  general.–  Whoever,  during  and  in  relation  to  any  felony  violation  enumerated  in 
subsection  (c),  knowingly  transfers,  possesses,  or  uses,  without  lawful  authority,  a  means  of 
identification of another person shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be 
sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years. 
[…] 

 

 

Phase 1 
In order to commit crimes related to identity theft, the offender needs to obtain possession of identity-
related data.1789 By criminalizing the “transfer” of means of identification with the intent to commit an 
offence, the provisions criminalize the acts related to phase 1 in a very broad way.1790 Due to the fact that 
the  provisions  focus  on  the  transfer  act,  they  do  not  cover  acts  undertaken  by  the  offender  prior  to 
initiation of the transfer process.1791 Acts like sending out phishing mails and designing malicious software 
that can be used to obtain computer identity related data from the victims are not covered by 18 USC 
§ 1028(a)(7) and 18 USC 1028A(a)(1). 

Phase 2 
By  criminalizing  possession  with  the  intent  to  commit  an  offence,  the  provisions  again  take  a  broad 
approach with regard to the criminalization of acts related to the second phase. This includes, especially, 
the  possession  of  identity-related  information  with  the  intention  to  use  it  later  in  one  of  the  classic 
offences  related  to  identity  theft.1792 The  possession  of  identity-related  data  without  the  intent  to  use 
them is not covered.1793 

Phase 3 
By criminalizing the “use” with the intent to commit an offence, the provisions cover the acts related to 
phase 3. 18 USC § 1028(a)(7) is, as mentioned above, not linked to a specific offence (like fraud).  
Another example is section 14 of the Cybercrime legislative text that was developed by the beneficiary 
states within the HIPCAR initiative.1794  
 
Identity-related Crimes  
14.  
A  person  who,  intentionally  without  lawful  excuse  or  justification  or  in  excess  of  a  lawful  excuse  or 
justification by using a computer system in any stage of the offence, intentionally transfers, possesses, or 
uses, without lawful excuse or justification, a means of identification of another person with the intent to 
commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any unlawful activity that constitutes a crime, commits an 
offence  punishable,  on  conviction,  by  imprisonment  for  a  period  not  exceeding  [period],  or  a  fine  not 
exceeding [amount], or both. 
 

 

215 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The provision covers the major phases of typical identity-related crimes described above. Only the first 
phase, in which the offender obtains the identity-related information, is not covered. “Transfer” of means 
of identity covers data-transmission processes from one computer to another computer system. This act 
is  especially  relevant  to  cover  the  sale  (and  related  transfer)  of  identity-related  information. 1795 
“Possession”  is  the  control  a  person  intentionally  exercises  over  identity-related  information.  “Use” 
covers a wide range of practices, such as submitting such information for purchase online. With regard to 
the mental element, the provision requires that the offender acts intentionally with regard to all objective 
elements and in addition has specific intent to undertake the activity to commit, aid or abet any unlawful 
activity that goes beyond the transfer, possession or use of identity-related information.  

Example of a multiple-provision approach 
The  main  difference  between  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  and  single-provision 
approaches (like for example the United States approach) is the fact that the Convention on Cybercrime 
does not define a separate cyberoffence of the unlawful use of identity-related information.1796 Similar to 
the situation with regard to the criminalization of obtaining identity-related information, the Convention 
on Cybercrime does not cover all possible acts related to the unlawful use of personal information. 

Phase 1 
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime1797 contains  a  number  of  provisions  that  criminalize 
Internet-related identity-theft acts in phase 1. These are especially:  

• 
Illegal access (Article 2)1798 
• 
Illegal interception (Article 3)1799 
•  Data interference (Article 4) 1800 

Taking into consideration the various ways in which an offender can access the data, it must be pointed 
out that not all possible acts in phase 1 are covered. One example of an offence that is often related to 
phase 1 of identity theft but is not covered by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is data 
espionage.  

Phase 2 
Acts  that  take  place  between  obtaining  information  and  using  it  for  criminal  purposes  can  hardly  be 
covered  by  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.  It  is  especially  not  possible  to  prevent  a 
growing black market for identity-related information by criminalizing the sale of such information based 
on the provisions provided by the Convention on Cybercrime. 

Phase 3 
The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime defines a number of cybercrime-related offences. Some 
of these offences can be committed by the perpetrator using identity-related information. One example is 
computer-related fraud, which is often mentioned in the context of identity theft.1801 Surveys on identity 
theft  show that most  of  the  data  obtained  are  used  for  credit-card  fraud.1802 If the credit-card  fraud  is 
committed online, it is likely that the perpetrator can be prosecuted based on Article 8 of the Council of 
Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.  Other  offences  that  can  be  carried  out  using  identity-related 
information obtained previously that are not mentioned in the Convention on Cybercrime are not covered 
by the legal framework. It is especially not possible to prosecute the use of identity-related information 
with the intention to conceal identity.  

6.2.18  Computer-related fraud 
Fraud  is  a  popular  crime  in  cyberspace.1803 It  is  also  a  common  problem  beyond  the  Internet,  so  most 
national  laws  contain  provisions  criminalizing  fraud  offences.1804 However,  the  application  of  existing 
provisions to Internet-related cases can be difficult, where traditional national criminal law provisions are 
based  on  the  falsity  of  a  person.1805 In  many  cases  of  fraud  committed  over  the  Internet,  it  is  in  fact  a 

216 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
computer  system  that  responds  to  an  act  of  the  offender.  If  traditional  criminal  provisions  addressing 
fraud do not cover computer systems, an update of the national law is necessary.1806  

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  seeks  to  criminalize  any  undue  manipulation  in  the  course  of  data 
processing with the intention to effect an illegal transfer of property, by providing an article on computer-
related fraud:1807  

The provision 
 
Article 8 – Computer-related fraud 
Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the causing of a loss of 
property to another person by: 
 
 
with  fraudulent  or  dishonest  intent  of  procuring,  without  right,  an  economic  benefit  for  oneself  or  for 
another person.  

a. any input, alteration, deletion or suppression of computer data, 
b. any interference with the functioning of a computer system,  

The acts covered 
Article  8  a)  contains  a  list of  the  most relevant  acts of  computer-related  fraud.1808 “Input”  of  computer 
data  covers  all  kind  of  input  manipulation  such  as  feeding  incorrect  data  into  the  computer  as  well  as 
computer  software  manipulations  and  other  acts  of  interference  in  the  course  of  data  processing.1809 
“Alteration”  refers  to  the  modification  of  existing  data.1810 The  term  “suppression”  of  computer  data 
denotes an action that affects the availability of data.1811 “Deletion” corresponds to the definition of the 
term in Article 4 covering acts where information is removed.1812  
In  addition  to  the  list  of  acts,  Article 8,  sub-paragraph  b)  contains  the  general  clause  that  criminalizes 
fraud-related “interference with the functioning of a computer system”. The general clause was added to 
the list of covered acts in order to leave the provision open to further developments.1813  
The Explanatory Report points out that “interference with the functioning of a computer system” covers 
acts such as hardware manipulations, acts suppressing printouts and acts affecting recording or flow of 
data, or the sequence in which programs are run.1814 

Economic loss 
Under most national criminal law, the criminal act must result in an economic loss. The Convention on 
Cybercrime  follows  a  similar  concept  and  limits  criminalization  to  those  acts  where  the  manipulations 
produce direct economic or possessory loss of another person’s property including money, tangibles and 
intangibles with an economic value.1815  

Mental element 
As for the other offences listed, Article 8 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime requires that 
the offender has acted intentionally. This intent refers to the manipulation as well as the financial loss.  
In  addition,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  requires  that  the  offender  has  acted  with  a  fraudulent  or 
dishonest intent to gain economic or other benefit for self or other.1816 As examples of acts excluded from 
criminal  liability  due  to  lack  of  specific  intent,  the  Explanatory  Report  mentions  commercial  practices 
arising from market competition that may cause economic harm to one person and benefit to another, 
but that are not carried out with fraudulent or dishonest intent.1817 

 

217 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Without right 
Computer-related fraud can only be prosecuted under Article 8 of the Convention on Cybercrime if it is 
carried out “without right”. 1818 This includes the requirement that the economic benefit must be obtained 
without right. The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that acts carried out pursuant to 
a valid contract between the affected persons are not considered to be without right.1819  

Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law 
The  2002  Commonwealth  Model  Law  does  not  contain  a  provision  criminalizing  computer-related 
fraud.1820  

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The informal1821 1999 Stanford Draft International Convention does not contain a provision criminalizing 
computer-related fraud.  

6.2.19  Copyright crimes 
The switch from analogue to digital distribution of copyright-protected content marks a turning point in 
copyright violation.1822 The reproduction of music artwork and videos has historically been limited, since 
the reproduction of an analogue source was often accompanied by a loss of quality of the copy, which in 
turn limits the option to use the copy as a source for further reproductions. With the switch to digital 
sources, quality is preserved and consistent quality copies have become possible.1823  
The  entertainment 
implementing  technical  measures  (digital  rights 
management  or  DRM)  to  prevent  reproduction1824,  but  until  now  these  measures  have  typically  been 
circumvented  shortly  after  their  introduction.1825 Various  software  tools  are  available  over  the  Internet 
that enable users to copy music CDs and movie DVDs protected by DRM-systems. In addition, the Internet 
offers  unlimited  distribution  opportunities.  As  a  result,  the  infringement  of  intellectual  property  rights 
(especially of copyright) is a widely committed offence over the Internet.1826  

industry  has  responded  by 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  includes  a  provision  covering  these  copyright  offences  that  seeks  to 
harmonize  the  various  regulations  in  national  laws.  This  provision  turned  out  to  be  one  of  the  main 
obstacles to the use of the Convention on Cybercrime outside of Europe.  
 
Article 10 – Offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights 
(1) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences  under  its  domestic  law  the  infringement  of  copyright,  as  defined  under  the  law  of  that  Party, 
pursuant  to  the  obligations  it  has  undertaken  under  the  Paris  Act  of  24  July  1971  revising  the  Bern 
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual  Property  Rights  and  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty,  with  the  exception  of  any  moral  rights 
conferred  by  such  conventions,  where  such  acts  are  committed  wilfully,  on  a  commercial  scale  and  by 
means of a computer system. 
(2) Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences under its domestic law the infringement of related rights, as defined under the law of that Party, 
pursuant  to  the  obligations  it  has  undertaken  under  the  International  Convention  for  the  Protection  of 
Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations (Rome Convention), the Agreement 
on  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  and  the  WIPO  Performances  and  Phonograms 
Treaty,  with  the  exception  of  any  moral  rights  conferred  by  such  conventions,  where  such  acts  are 
committed wilfully, on a commercial scale and by means of a computer system. 

218 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
(3) A Party may reserve the right not to impose criminal liability under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article in 
limited circumstances, provided that other effective remedies are available and that such reservation does 
not derogate from the Party’s international obligations set forth in the international instruments referred 
to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article. 
 
The  infringement  of  copyrights  is  criminalized  in  some  countries1827 and  addressed  by  a  number  of 
international treaties.1828 The Convention on Cybercrime aims to provide fundamental principles regarding 
the  criminalization  of  copyright  violations  in  order  to  harmonize  existing  national  legislation.  Patent  or 
trademark-related violations are not covered by the provision.1829  

Reference to international agreements 
Unlike  other  legal  frameworks,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  explicitly  name  the  acts  to  be 
criminalized, but refers to a number of international agreements.1830 This is one of the aspects which has 
been criticized with regard to Article 10. Apart from the fact that it makes it more difficult to discover the 
extent  of  criminalization  and  that  the  agreements  might  subsequently  be  changed,  the  question  was 
raised  whether  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  obliges  the  signatory  states  to  sign  the  international 
agreements mentioned in Article 10. The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime pointed out that no 
such obligation shall be introduced by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.1831 Those states 
that have not signed the mentioned international agreements are therefore neither obliged to sign the 
agreements nor forced to criminalize acts related to agreements they have not signed. Article 10 thus only 
places obligations on those parties that have signed one of the mentioned agreements.  

Mental element 
Due  to  its  general  nature,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  limits  criminalization  to  acts  committed  by 
means of a computer system.1832 In addition to acts committed over a computer system, criminal liability 
is limited to acts that are committed wilfully and on a commercial scale. The term “wilfully” corresponds 
to “intentionally” used in the other substantive law provisions of the Convention on Cybercrime and takes 
account of the terminology used in Article 61 of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS) Agreement1833, which governs the obligation to criminalize copyright violations.1834 

Commercial scale 
The  limitation  to  acts  that  are  committed  on  a  commercial  scale  also  takes  account  of  the  TRIPS 
Agreement, which requires criminal sanctions only for “piracy on a commercial scale”. As most copyright 
violations  in  file-sharing  systems  are  not  committed  on  a  commercial  scale,  they  are  not  covered  by 
Article 10. The Convention on Cybercrime seeks to set minimum standards for Internet-related offences. 
Thus,  parties  can  go  beyond  the  threshold  of  “commercial  scale”  in  the  criminalization  of  copyright 
violations.1835  

Without right 
In  general  the  substantive  criminal  law  provisions  defined  by  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime  require  that  the  act  is  carried  out  “without  right”.1836 The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime pointed out that the term “infringement” already implies that the act was committed without 
authorization.1837  

Restrictions and reservations 
Paragraph 3 enables signatories to make a reservation, as long as other effective remedies are available 
and the reservation does not derogate from the parties’ international obligations. 

Stanford Draft International Convention 
The  informal1838 1999  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (“Stanford  Draft”)  does  not  include  a 
provision  criminalizing  copyright  violations.  The  drafters  of  Stanford  Draft  pointed  out  that  copyright 

 

219 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
crimes were not included because this may have proven difficult.1839 Instead, they referred directly to the 
existing international agreements.1840  

6.2.20  Terrorist use of the Internet 
As pointed out above, the term “terrorist use of the Internet” is used to describe a set of activities that 
range from spreading of propaganda to targeted attacks. With regard to the legal response, it is possible 
to distinguish between three different systematic approaches.  

Systematic approaches 

investigation 

Use of existing cybercrime legislation 
The first approach is the use of existing cybercrime legislation (developed to cover non-terrorist related 
acts)  to  criminalize  terrorist  use  of  the  Internet.  In  this  context,  three  aspects  need  to  be  taken  into 
consideration.  First,  substantive  criminal  law  provisions  that  were  implemented  to  cover  non-terrorist 
related acts such as system interference1841 might be applicable in terrorist-related cases, but very often 
the range for sentencing will differ from specific terrorism legislation. This could influence the ability to 
use  sophisticated 
instruments  that  are  restricted  to  terrorist  or  organized  crime 
investigation.  Secondly,  the  application  of  cybercrime-specific  investigation  instruments  in  cases  of 
terrorist use of the Internet faces fewer challenges, insofar as most countries do not limit the application 
of  sophisticated  investigation  instruments  to  traditional  cybercrime  offences,  but  include  any  offence 
involving  computer  data.  Finally,  regional  legal  instruments  developed  to  address  the  challenge  of 
cybercrime  but  not  specifically  terrorist  use  of  the  Internet  often  contain  exemptions  for  international 
cooperation with regard to political offences. One example is Article 27, paragraph 4.a. of the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime.1842  
 
Article  27  –  Procedures  pertaining  to  mutual  assistance  requests  in  the  absence  of  applicable 
international agreements 
[…] 
4. The requested Party may, in addition to the grounds for refusal established in Article 25, paragraph 4, 
refuse assistance if: 
 

a  the  request  concerns  an  offence  which  the  requested  Party  considers  a  political  offence  or  an 
offence connected with a political offence, or 
b it considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, ordre public 
or other essential interests. 

[…] 
 
The provision authorizes parties to the Convention to refuse mutual assistance requests if they concern 
an offence which the requested Party considers a political offence or an offence connected with a political 
offence. This can seriously hinder investigations. As a consequence, terrorism-specific legal frameworks 
such  as  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Prevention  of  Terrorism  from  20051843 contain  an 
exclusion of the political exception clause.  
 
Article 20 – Exclusion of the political exception clause 
1 None of the offences referred to in Articles 5 to 7 and 9 of this Convention, shall be regarded, for the 
purposes  of  extradition  or  mutual  legal  assistance,  as  a  political  offence,  an  offence  connected  with  a 
political offence, or as an offence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition or for 
mutual legal assistance based on such an offence may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a 
political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives. 
[…] 

 

220 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Use of existing anti-terrorism legislation 
The second approach is the use of existing terrorism legislation to criminalize and prosecute terrorist use 
of the Internet. Such a traditional instrument is, for example, the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on 
the Prevention of Terrorism.1844  
 
Article 5 – Public provocation to commit a terrorist offence 
1.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Convention,  public  provocation  to  commit  a  terrorist  offence  means  the 
distribution,  or  otherwise  making  available,  of  a  message  to  the  public,  with  the  intent  to  incite  the 
commission  of  a  terrorist  offence,  where  such  conduct,  whether  or  not  directly  advocating  terrorist 
offences, causes a danger that one or more such offences may be committed. 
2. Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish public provocation to commit a 
terrorist offence, as defined in paragraph 1, when committed unlawfully and intentionally, as a criminal 
offence under its domestic law. 

 
Article 6 – Recruitment for terrorism 
1.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Convention,  recruitment  for  terrorism  means  to  solicit  another  person  to 
commit or participate in the commission of a terrorist offence, or to join an association or group, for the 
purpose  of  contributing  to  the  commission  of  one  or  more  terrorist  offences  by  the  association  or  the 
group. 
2. Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish recruitment for terrorism, as 
defined  in  paragraph  1,  when  committed  unlawfully  and  intentionally,  as  a  criminal  offence  under  its 
domestic law. 

The Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism contains several offences such as public provocation to 
commit a terrorist offence and recruitment for terrorism but does not, for example, contain provisions 
criminalizing terrorism-related attacks against computer systems. Furthermore, the Convention does not 
contain  procedural  instruments.  Especially  with  regard  to the  investigation  of  Internet-related offences 
specific  procedural  instruments  are  often  required.  Identifying  an  offender  who  has  incited  terrorism 
using websites requires sophisticated instruments such as the expedited preservation of traffic data.  

Specific legislation 
The third approach is the development of specific legislation addressing terrorist use of the Internet.  

Examples of specific legislation 
As pointed out above, the term “terrorist use of the Internet” is used to describe a set of activities that 
range from spreading of propaganda to targeted attacks. In terms of the legal response, there are two 
main areas of regulation: computer-related attacks and illegal content.  

Computer-related attacks 
One approach for a provision that specifically addresses terrorism-related computer attacks is Section 66F 
of the Indian Information Technology Act 2000, amended in 2008:  
 
66F  Punishment  for  cyber  terrorism  –  Information  Technology  Act,  2000.  [As  Amended  by  Information 
technology (Amendment) Act 2008] 
(1) Whoever,- 
 

(A) with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in 
the people or any section of the people by – 

 

 

 

(i) denying or cause the denial of access to any person authorized to access computer resource; 
or 
(ii) attempting to penetrate or access a computer resource without authorisation or exceeding 
authorized access; or 
(iii) introducing or causing to introduce any Computer Contaminant. 

 

221 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

 

and by means of such conduct causes or is likely to cause death or injuries to persons or damage 
to  or  destruction  of  property  or  disrupts  or  knowing  that  it  is  likely  to  cause  damage  or 
disruption of supplies or services essential to the life of the community or adversely affect the 
critical information infrastructure specified under section 70, or 

(B) knowingly or intentionally penetrates or accesses a computer resource without authorisation or 
exceeding authorized access, and by means of such conduct obtains access to information, data or 
computer database that is restricted for reasons of the security of the State or foreign relations; or 
any  restricted  information,  data  or  computer  database,  with  reasons  to  believe  that  such 
information, data or computer database so obtained may be used to cause or likely to cause injury 
to the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations 
with  foreign  States,  public  order,  decency  or  morality,  or  in  relation  to  contempt  of  court, 
defamation  or  incitement  to  an  offence,  or  to  the  advantage  of  any  foreign  nation,  group  of 
individuals or otherwise, commits the offence of cyber terrorism.  

(2) Whoever commits or conspires to commit cyber terrorism shall be punishable with imprisonment which 
may extend to imprisonment for life’. 
 

Section 66F of the Indian Information Technology  Act does not only require that the offender is acting 
with terrorism-related intent (“intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to 
strike terror in the people or any section of the people”) but also that the offence leads to severe damage 
such as death, injury or the disruption of services affecting critical information infrastructure.  

Illegal content 
Illegal  content  such  as  terrorist  propaganda  is  one  area  where  states  are  particularly  sticking  to 
technology-neutral approaches. One example of such a technology-neutral approach is Article 10 of the 
Russian  Federal  Law  149-FZ  of  27.07.2006  on  Information,  Information  Technologies  and  Protection  of 
Information. 
  
Article 10. Spreading of Information or Providing of Information 
[…] 
6.  It  is  forbidden  to  spread  information  aimed  at  war  propaganda,  national,  racial  or  religious 
discrimination  and  hostility,  as  well  other  information  whose  spreading  is  liable  to  criminal  or 
administrative responsibility. 
 
This provision does not specifically address the distribution of illegal content through computer networks 
or making content available on such networks, but was drafted so as to be technology neutral.  
Another example of a technology-neutral approach is Article 3 of the 2008 amendment of the EU Council 
Framework Decision1845 on Combating Terrorism.1846 
 
Article 3 – Offences linked to terrorist activities 
1. For the purposes of this Framework Decision: 
 

(a)  “public  provocation  to  commit  a  terrorist  offence”  shall  mean  the  distribution,  or  otherwise 
making available, of a message to the public, with the intent to incite the commission of one of the 
offences listed in 
Article  1(1)(a)  to  (h),  where  such  conduct,  whether  or  not  directly  advocating  terrorist  offences, 
causes a danger that one or more such offences may be committed; 
(b) “recruitment for terrorism” shall mean soliciting another person to commit one of the offences 
listed in Article 1(1)(a) to (h), or in Article 2(2); 

 

 

222 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

(c)  “training  for  terrorism”  shall  mean  providing  instruction  in  the  making  or  use  of  explosives, 
firearms  or  other  weapons  or  noxious  or  hazardous  substances,  or  in  other  specific  methods  or 
techniques, for the purpose of committing one of the offences listed in Article 1(1)(a) to (h), knowing 
that the skills provided are intended to be used for this purpose. 

2.  Each  Member  State  shall  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  offences  linked  to  terrorist 
activities include the following intentional acts: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(a) public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; 
(b) recruitment for terrorism; 
(c) training for terrorism; 
(d) aggravated theft with a view to committing one of the offences listed in Article 1(1); 
(e) extortion with a view to the perpetration of one of the offences listed in Article 1(1); 
(f) drawing up false administrative documents with a view to committing one of the offences listed 
in Article 1(1)(a) to (h) and Article 2(2)(b). 

3. For an act as set out in paragraph 2 to be punishable, it shall not be necessary that a terrorist offence be 
actually committed.’ 
 
The drafters emphasize in the introduction that the existing legal framework criminalizes aiding, abetting 
and  inciting  terrorism  but  does  not  criminalize  the  dissemination  of  terrorist  expertise  through  the 
Internet. In this context, the drafters pointed out that “the Internet is used to inspire and mobilise local 
terrorist networks and individuals in Europe and also serves as a source of information on terrorist means 
and methods, thus functioning as a ‘virtual training camp’.”1847 Despite the fact that terrorist use of the 
Internet was explicitly mentioned in the introduction, the provision provided is drafted in a technology-
neutral  manner  and  consequently  covers  both  online  and  offline  acts  of  training  for  terrorism.1848 One 
challenge related to the application of the provision in Internet-related cases is the difficulty of proving 
that the offender acted knowing that the skills provided were intended to be used for this purpose. It is 
quite  likely  that  the  need  for  such  evidence  will  limit  the  provision’s  applicability  to  online  guides  to 
weaponry. As most weapons and explosives can be used to commit regular crimes as well as terrorist-
related offences, the mere publication of this type of information does not prove that the publisher knew 
how it would be used. Therefore, the context of the publication (e.g. the fact that it appears on a website 
operated  by  a  terrorist  organization)  will  need  to  be  considered.  This  can  present  challenges  if  the 
information  published  is  outside  the  context  of  other  terrorism-related  content,  e.g. disseminated 
through file-sharing systems or file-hosting services. 
One example of an Internet-specific approach is Article 5 of the Chinese Computer Information Network 
and Internet Security, Protection and Management Regulations. 
 
“Article  5:  No  unit  or  individual  may  use  the  Internet  to  create,  replicate,  retrieve,  or  transmit  the 
following kinds of information: 
 

(1) Inciting to resist or breaking the Constitution or laws or the implementation of administrative 
regulations; 
(2) Inciting to overthrow the government of the socialist system; 
(3) Inciting division of the country, harming national unification; 
(4) Inciting hatred or discrimination among nationalities or harming the unity of the nationalities; 
(5) Making falsehoods or distorting the truth, spreading rumors, destroying the order of society; 
(6) Promoting feudal superstitious, sexually suggestive material, gambling, violence, murder; 
(7) Terrorism, or inciting others to criminal activity; openly insulting other people or distorting the 
truth to slander people; 
(8) Injuring the reputation of state organs; 
(9) Other activities against the Constitution, law or administrative regulations.” 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 

223 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Cyberwarfare 
Although threats related to cyberwarfare have been discussed for several decades, the debate on legal 
response  has  only  just  started.  Even  more  than  cybercrime,  cyberwarfare  is  governed  by  international 
law. The Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions and the UN Charter are important instruments of 
international law which contain regulations governing the laws of war. While there is significant practice 
of  applying  those  instruments  to  regular  armed  conflicts,  their  application  to  computer  and  network-
based attacks runs into difficulties. This can be demonstrated by analysing the applicability of Article 2(4) 
of the UN Charter, banning the use of force.  
 
Art. 2 UN Charter 
The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance 
with the following Principles. 
[...] 
(4) All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the 
territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the 
Purposes of the United Nations. 
[...] 
 

The prohibition of the use of force intends to enforce a comprehensive ban on all types of force, except 
those which are in line with the UN Charter.1849 In recent decades, the prohibition of the use of force in 
Article 2 (4) has been challenged several times. One of the main challenges has been the shift from full-
scale wars that constituted the focus when the UN Charter was drafted after World War II to small-scale 
warfare  which  is  much  more  frequent  nowadays.1850 Covering  computer-related  attacks  adds  another 
dimension to the challenge, insofar as not only the scale but also the methods and tools used within the 
conflict differ.1851 Consequently, the main difficulty related to the application of Article 2 is interpretation 
of  the  term  “use  of  force”.  Neither  the  UN  Charter  nor  any  related  international  instrument  clearly 
defines the term “use of force”. It is widely accepted that not all types of hostile acts are prohibited by the 
UN Charter. Attacks with conventional weapons are covered, for example, but not the threat of force and 
economic coercion.1852  
The two constituent elements of the use of force are the use of weapons and the involvement of state 
actors.  Even  though  the  importance  of  the  latter,  in  particular,  was  questioned  by  Security  Council 
resolutions after the 9/11 attacks, both elements remain essential with regard to the ban on the use of 
force.  

Use of weapons/destruction of life and property 
The  first  constituting  element  is  the  use  of  weapons. Computer  technology  used  to  carry  out Internet-
related attacks can hardly be called a traditional weapon, insofar as such weapons in general involve a 
kinetic impact.1853 Nevertheless, the need to include chemical and biological weapons has already required 
a  shift  from  an  action-oriented  definition  to  an  impact-oriented  approach.  Under  such  a  broader 
approach, weapons could be defined as a tool to destroy life or property.1854  
Even based upon a broad interpretation of this type, however, it is challenging to cover computer and 
network-based  attacks  as  use  of  force  and  computer  technology  as  weapons,  since  the  impact  of  the 
attacks  is  different.1855 Not  only  the  methods  used  but  also  the  effects  differ  in  relation  to  traditional 
armed  conflicts.1856 Traditional  military  strategies  involving  the  use  of  weapons  focus  on  the  physical 
termination of an enemy’s military capabilities. Computer and network-based attacks can be carried out 
with minimal physical damage and loss of life.1857 Unlike a missile attack, a denial-of-service attack that 
temporarily  shuts  down  a  government  website  does  not  cause  any  actual  physical  harm.  However,  it 
would be misleading to contend that computer attacks cannot lead to serious harm. A DoS attack against 
the computer system of a hospital or blood bank can pose a serious threat to health and endanger the 
lives  of  a  large  number  of  people.  The  discovery  of  the  possible  physical  impact  of  Stuxnet  is  another 
example showing that computer attacks do not necessarily have non-physical consequences. If computer 

224 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
and  network-based  attacks  have  such  a  physical  impact,  they  can  be  considered  to  be  similar  to 
traditional weapons.1858  

Conflict among states 
As pointed out above, the second requirement for the application of Article 2 of the UN Charter is that the 
use  of  force  is  undertaken  by  a  state  against  another  state.  Despite  recent  trends  to  broaden  the 
application of the UN Charter acts committed by non-state actors are not covered by Article 2 of the UN 
Charter. This is of great relevance for the coverage of cyberwarfare, insofar as here – unlike in traditional 
wars  –  non-state  actors  play  a  more  important  role.  There  are  serious  concerns  with  regard  to 
proliferation,  as  non-state  actors  can  acquire  powerful  resources  that  might  even  go  beyond  those 
controlled  by  states.1859 The  largest  botnets  contain  several  million  computer  systems.  This  number  is 
potentially 
larger  than  the  number  of  state-controlled  computer  systems  available  for  military 
interventions in most states. The capabilities of non-state actors is highly relevant, since they primarily act 
outside  the  international  legal  framework  which  binds  states.  This  raises  concerns  with  regard  to 
attribution. The application of Article 2 of the UN Charter so far requires that a computer attack be traced 
back  to  a  state.  Experiences  with  incidents  in  Estonia  in  2007  and  Georgia  in  2008  underscore  that,  in 
most cases, identification or verification of the source of an attack may be an insuperable challenge.

Especially  due  to  increasing  hard-drive  capacities1860 and  the  falling  cost1861 of  the  storage  of  digital 
documents  compared  to  the  storage  of  physical  documents,  the  number  of  digital  documents  is 
growing.1862 Today, a significant amount of data is stored in digital form only.1863 In addition, computer and 
network  technologies  have  become  part  of  everyday  life  in  developed  countries  and  increasingly  in 
developing countries. As a consequence, electronic documents such as text documents, digital videos and 
digital pictures1864 are playing a role in cybercrime investigations and related court proceedings.1865  
Yet  the  impact  of  digitization  and  the  importance  of  digital  evidence  is  stretching  beyond  cybercrime 
investigation:  even  when  committing  traditional  crimes,  offenders  may  leave  digital  traces,  such  as 
information on the location of their cellphone1866 or suspicious search-engine requests.1867 The ability to 
exploit  specific  data-related  investigation  tools  and  present  digital  evidence  in  court  is  therefore 
considered essential for both cybercrime-related and traditional crime investigation.1868  
Dealing with “digital evidence” presents a number of challenges,1869 but also opens up new possibilities for 
investigation and for the work of forensic experts and courts. Already at the first stage – the collection of 
evidence – the need to be able to handle digital evidence has changed the work of investigators. They 
need  specific  investigation  tools  to  carry  out  investigations.  The  availability  of  such  instruments  is 
especially relevant if traditional evidence like fingerprints or witnesses is not available. In these cases, the 
ability  to  successfully  identify  and  prosecute  an  offender  may  be  based  on  the  correct  collection  and 
evaluation of digital evidence.1870 Beyond the collection of evidence, however, digitization also influences 
the  way  law-enforcement  agencies  and  courts  deal  with  evidence.1871 While  traditional  documents  are 
introduced by handing out the original document in court, digital evidence in some cases requires specific 
procedures that do not allow conversion into traditional evidence, e.g. by presenting a printout of files 
and other discovered data.1872  
The  following  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  practical  and  legal  aspects  of  digital  evidence  and 
cybercrime investigations.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Definition of digital evidence 

 
6.3.1 
The digitization and emerging use of ICT has a huge impact on procedures for the collection of evidence 
and its use in court.1873 As a consequence of the development, digital evidence has been introduced as a 
new source of evidence.1874 There is no single definition  of electronic  or digital evidence.1875 The United 
Kingdom (UK) Police and Criminal Evidence Code defines digital evidence as “all information contained in 
a  computer”.1876 A  broader  approach  defines  digital  evidence  as  any  data  stored  or  transmitted  using 
computer technology that supports the theory of how an offence occurred.1877  

Importance of digital evidence in cybercrime investigations 

6.3.2 
Digital  evidence  plays  an  important  role  in  various  phases  of  cybercrime  investigations.  It  is  in  general 
possible  to  divide  between  two  major  phases1878:  the  investigation  phase  (identification  of  relevant 
evidence1879,  collection  and  preservation  of  evidence1880,  analysis  of  computer  technology  and  digital 
evidence) and the presentation and use of evidence in court proceedings. 
The first phase is linked to computer forensics, which will be discussed more in detail below. The term 
“computer forensics” describes the systematic analysis of IT equipment with the purpose of searching for 
digital  evidence.1881 The  constant  growth  in  the  amount  of  data  stored  in  digital  format  highlights  the 
logistic  challenges  of  investigations.1882 Approaches  to  automated  forensic  procedures  by,  for  example, 
using  hash-value  based  searches  for  known  child-pornography  images 1883 or  keyword  searches 1884 
therefore  play  an  important  role  in  addition  to  manual  investigations.1885 Computer  forensics  include 
investigations  such  as  analysing  the  hardware  and  software  used  by  a  suspect,1886 recovering  deleted 
files,1887 decrypting files1888 or identifying Internet users by analysing traffic data.1889 
The second phase relates to the presentation of digital evidence in court. It is closely linked to specific 
procedures that are required because digital information can only be made visible when printed out or 
displayed with the use of computer technology.  

6.3.3  Growing importance of digital evidence in traditional crime investigations 
The ability of investigators to search for data or seize evidence as well as the ability of courts to deal with 
digital evidence is not limited to cybercrime investigations. Due to the increasing integration of computer 
technology in people’s everyday life, digital evidence is becoming an important source of evidence even in 
traditional  investigation.  One  example  is  a  murder  trial  in  the  US,  in  which  records  of  search-engine 
requests stored on the suspect’s computer were used to prove that, prior to the murder, the suspect was 
intensively using search engines to find information on undetectable poisons.  

6.3.4  New opportunities for investigation 
Depending on the ICT and Internet services used by a suspect, a wide variety of digital traces are left.1890 If, 
for example, a suspect uses search engines to find online child pornography his search request, then IP-
addresses  and  in  some  case  even  additional  identity-related  information  (such  as  Google  ID)  are 
recorded.1891 Digital  cameras  used  to  produce  child-pornography  images  in  some  cases  include  geo-
information in the file that enables investigators to identify the location where the picture was taken if 
such images are seized on a server.1892 Suspects who download illegal content from file-sharing networks 
can  in  some  cases  be  traced  by  the  unique  ID  that  is  generated  in  the  installation  of  the  file-sharing 
software.1893 And  the  falsification  of  an  electronic  document  might  generate  metadata  that  enable  the 
original author of the document to prove the manipulation.1894 
Another  aspect  that  is  frequently  quoted  as  an  advantage  is  the  neutrality  and  reliability  of  digital 
evidence.1895 In  comparison  with  some  other  categories  of  evidence  such  as  witness  statements,  digital 
evidence is certainly less vulnerable to influence that can affect the preservation of evidence.1896  

Challenges 

6.3.5 
In  the  early  days  of  computer  technology,  the  ability  of  law  enforcement  to  carry  out  investigations 
involving digital data was limited by a lack of computer forensic equipment and expertise.1897 The growing 

 

227 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
importance of digital evidence has spawned an increasing number of computer forensic laboratories. Yet, 
while the logistical aspects of the issue can be solved fairly easily, a number of challenges remain.  
The  underlying  reason  for  these  challenges  is  the  fact  that,  despite  a  number  of  similarities  between 
digital  evidence  and  other  categories  of  evidence,  there  are  major  differences.  Some  of  the  general 
principles1898, such as the requirement that the evidence be authentic, complete, reliable1899 and accurate 
and that the process of obtaining the evidence take place in line with the legal requirements, still hold 
good.1900 Alongside  the  similarities,  however,  there  are a number  of  aspects  that  make  digital  evidence 
unique  and  therefore  require  special  attention  when  dealing  with  digital  evidence 
in  criminal 
investigations. 

Need for scientific research and training 
Digital evidence is a relatively new category of evidence and the field is developing fast. And despite the 
very limited time-frame available for basic scientific research, the procedures for searching, seizing and 
analysing  digital  evidence  now  already  need  to  be  based  on  scientifically  reliable  principles  and 
procedures.1901 Despite  intensive  research  already  undertaken  there  are  various  areas  that  require  the 
attention  of  scientists.  It  is  therefore  important  that  scientific  research  in  controversial  areas  such  the 
reliability  of  evidence  in  general1902 or  the  quantification  of  potential  rates  of  error1903 should  continue. 
The impact of the constant evolution is not restricted to the need for ongoing scientific research. Given 
that developments might raise new challenges for forensic examination,1904 it is necessary to be constantly 
training experts.  

Need for binding legal standards 
Although  computer  and  network  technologies  are  used  globally  and  the  challenges  related  to  the 
admissibility of digital evidence in court are – despite the different legal systems – similar, binding legal 
standards dealing with digital evidence have not been widely implemented.1905 Only some countries have 
so far started to update their relevant legislation to enable courts to deal directly with digital evidence.1906 
As  with  regard  to  substantive  criminal  law  and  procedural  instruments  in  the  fight  against  cybercrime, 
here too there is a lack of global harmonization of legal standards, in the area of digital evidence.  

Quantitative aspects 
As pointed out above, the low costs1907 compared to the storage of physical documents are giving rise to 
an  increasing  number  of  digital  documents.1908 Despite  the  availability  of  tools  to  automate  search 
processes1909,  identifying  the  relevant  digital  evidence  on  a  storage  device  that  can  carry  millions  of 
documents is a logistical challenge for investigators.1910 

Reliance on expert statements 
Analysing and evaluating digital evidence requires special skills and technical understanding which is not 
necessarily  covered  in  the  education  received  by  judges,  prosecutors  and  lawyers.  They  therefore  rely 
increasingly  on the support of experts in the recovery of digital evidence.1911 While this situation is not 
significantly  different  from  other  sophisticated  investigation  techniques,  such  as  DNA  sequencing,  it 
prompts the need for necessary debate on the consequences for such dependence. To avoid a negative 
influence, courts are encouraged to question the reliability of evidence and require qualification of the 
associated uncertainty.1912  

Fragile nature of digital evidence 
Digital  data  are  highly  fragile  and  can  so  easily  be  deleted1913 or  modified1914 that  experts  consider  it 
alarming.1915 Like  other  categories  of  evidence,  digital  data  present  some  degree  of  uncertainty.1916 To 
avoid a negative impact on reliability, the collection of digital evidence is often subject to certain technical 
requirements. The shutdown of a computer system will, for example, result in a loss of all memory stored 
in the RAM system memory1917 unless special technical measures to prevent this process are applied.1918 In 
cases  where  data  are  stored  in  a  temporary  memory,  the  technique  of  collecting  the  evidence  can  be 

228 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
different from the process of collecting traditional digital evidence.1919 Such a sophisticated approach can 
be  necessary,  for  example,  if  the  suspect  is  using  encryption  technology  and  the  investigators  want  to 
examine  whether  information  stored  in  the  RAM  memory  can  help  them  to  access  encrypted 
information.1920  
Modifications can be made both intentionally by the offender or accidentally by the investigators. A loss 
or modification of data can in the worst scenario lead to wrongful conviction.1921  
As a consequence of its fragility, one of the most fundamental principles of computer forensics is the need 
to maintain the integrity of digital evidence.1922 Integrity can in this context be defined as the property 
whereby digital data have not been altered in an unauthorized manner since the time they were created, 
transmitted or stored by an authorized source.1923 Protecting integrity is necessary to ensure reliability and 
accuracy.1924 Handling  evidence  of  this  kind  requires  standards  and  procedures  in  order  to  maintain  an 
effective quality system. This includes general aspects such as case records, the use of widely accepted 
technology  and  procedures,  and  operation  by  qualified  experts  only1925,  as  well  as  the  application  of 
specific methods such as checksum, hash algorithm and digital signatures.1926 The required methods are 
costly and cannot completely exclude the risks of alteration.1927 

Limited amount of data recorded 
For many Internet users, it is surprising how much information about their activities is stored. The average 
user  might  not  be  aware  that  when  accessing  the  Internet  or  carrying  out  specific  actions  like  using  a 
search engine1928 he/she is leaving traces. These can be a valuable source of digital evidence in cybercrime 
investigation. Nonetheless, not all digital information generated during the use of computer technology is 
stored. Many actions and much information such as clicks and keystrokes are not retained unless special 
surveillance software is installed.1929  

Layer of abstraction 
Even if a suspect’s activities create digital evidence, this evidence is separated in time from the events it 
records and is therefore more of a historic record than a live observation.1930 In addition, the evidence is 
not  necessarily  personalized.  If,  for  example,  a  suspect  is  using  a  public  Internet  café  to  access  child 
pornography, the traces do not necessarily contain identity-related information that allows identification. 
Unless the suspect at the same time downloads his e-mails or uses services that require a registration, in 
which case a link is created. But as this is not necessarily the case, experts point out that this leads to a 
layer of abstraction that can introduce errors.1931  

Requirements related to infrastructure 
The  design  of  courtrooms  has  followed  similar  principles  for  decades  and  in  some  countries  even 
centuries.  Leaving  aside  aspects  of  security  (e.g.  installed  metal  detectors  and  x-ray  machines)  and 
comfort (e.g. air conditioning), it is possible to use a courtroom designed and equipped a hundred years 
ago for criminal proceedings.1932 The need to deal with digital evidence raises challenges, in terms of the 
layer of abstraction and the fact that digital evidence cannot be presented without tools like printers or 
screens, has implications for the design of courtrooms.1933 Screens need to be installed to ensure that the 
judges,  prosecutor,  defence  lawyers,  the  accused  and  of  course  the  jury  are  able  to  follow  the 
presentation of evidence. Installing and maintaining such equipment generates significant cost for judicial 
systems.  

Changing technical environment 
As pointed out above, technology is constantly changing. This calls for constant review of procedures and 
equipment  as  well  as  related  training 
in  order  to  ensure  the  suitability  and  effectiveness  of 
investigations.1934 With  ever  new  versions  of  operating  systems  or  software  products,  the  way  data 
relevant  for  investigations  is  stored  can  change.  Similar  developments  take  place  with  regard  to  the 
hardware.1935 In  the  past,  data  were  stored  on  floppy  disks.  Today,  investigators  will  find  that  relevant 
information  might  be  stored  on  MP3-players  or  in  watches  that  include  a  USB-storage  device.  The 

 

229 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
challenges  are  not  limited  to  keeping  up  with  the  latest  trends  in  computer  technology.1936 Forensic 
experts also need to maintain equipment to deal with discontinued technology, such as 5.25 inch floppy 
disks.  In  addition  to  changes  in  hardware,  discontinued  software  needs  to  be  accessible:  files  from 
discontinued software tools can often not be opened without using the original software. 
It  is  also  necessary  to  carefully  study  fundamental  changes  in  user  behaviour.  The  availability  of 
broadband access and remote storage servers has, for example, influenced the way information is stored. 
While in the past investigators were able to focus on the suspect’s premises when searching for digital 
evidence,  today  they  need  to  take  into  consideration  that  files  might  physically  be  stored  abroad  and 
accessed remotely by the suspect when necessary.1937 The increasing use of cloud storage presents new 
challenges for investigators.1938  

Equivalences of digital evidence and traditional evidence 

6.3.6 
Research  undertaken  in  Europe  in  2005/2006  highlighted  various  areas  of  equivalence  of  digital  and 
traditional evidence in the 16 countries analysed.1939 The most common equivalence is between electronic 
documents and documents in paper form. Additional equivalences frequently found are electronic mail 
and traditional mail, electronic signature and traditional handwritten signatures, and electronic notarial 
deeds and traditional notarial deeds.1940 

Relation between digital evidence and traditional evidence 

6.3.7 
With  regard  to  the  relationship  between  digital  evidence  and  traditional  evidence,  it  is  possible  to 
distinguish between two processes: the replacement of traditional evidence by digital evidence, and the 
introduction of digital evidence as an additional source complementing traditional forms of evidence such 
as documents and witnesses.  
One example of digital evidence replacing traditional evidence is the increasing use of e-mail instead of 
letters.1941 In  cases  where  no  physical  letters  are  sent,  investigations  need  to  focus  on  digital  evidence. 
This has implications in respect of the methods available for analysing and presenting the evidence. In the 
past, when handwritten letters were the dominant means of non-verbal communication, forensic analysis 
concentrated on forensic handwriting investigation.1942 Already back when typewriters became popular, 
the methods employed by forensic experts changed from handwriting forensics to typewriter analysis.1943 
With  the  ongoing  shift  from  letters  to  e-mails,  investigators  need  to  deal  with  e-mail  forensics1944 
instead.1945 While, on the one hand, the resulting inability to use physical documents limits the possibility 
of  related 
investigators  can  now  use  tools  to  automate  e-mail 
investigations.1946 
Although  in  the  majority  of  cases  involving  electronic  communication  the  focus  will  likely  be  on  digital 
evidence1947,  other  categories  of  evidence  can  still  play  in  important  role  in  the  identification  of  the 
offender. This is especially relevant because not all computer operations leave digital traces and not all 
traces that are left can be linked to the suspect.1948 If public Internet terminals are used to download child 
pornography, it might not be possible to link the download process to an identifiable person if that person 
did not register1949 or leave any personal information; but the recording on a videosurveillance camera or 
fingerprints  on  the  keyboard  could  be  useful,  if  available.  Conversely,  in  traditional  crimes  where 
fingerprints, DNA traces and witnesses play a dominant role, digital evidence can be a valuable additional 
source of evidence. Information about the location of the suspect’s phone might allow law-enforcement 
agencies to identify his location1950 and suspicious search-engine requests might lead to the location of a 
missing victim.1951 With regard to crimes that include financial transactions (such as commercial exchange 
of child pornography1952), investigations can also include records kept by financial organizations in order to 
identify  the  offender.  In  2007,  a  global  child-pornography  investigation  relied  on  the  identification  of 
suspects based on records of financial transactions related to the purchase of child pornography.1953

Admissibility of digital evidence 

6.3.8 
There are two major areas of discussion with regard to digital evidence: the process of collection of digital 
evidence, and the admissibility of digital evidence in court. Specific requirements relating to the collection 

230 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
of digital evidence will be discussed further in the chapter below dealing with procedural law. With regard 
to  the  admissibility  of  digital  evidence,  despite  the  differences  compared  to  traditional  evidence  the 
fundamental principles are the same. Summarizing those principles is a challenge, though, since not only 
is  there  a  lack  of  binding  international  agreements,  but  there  are  also  substantial  differences  in  the 
dogmatic approach to dealing with digital evidence. While some countries give judges wide discretion in 
admitting or rejecting digital evidence, others have started to develop a legal framework to address the 
admissibility of evidence in court.1954  

Legitimacy 
One  of  the  most  fundamental  requirements  for  the  admissibility  of  both  traditional  categories  of 
evidence1955 and digital evidence alike is the legitimacy of evidence.1956 This principle requires that digital 
evidence has been collected, analysed, preserved and finally presented in court in accordance with the 
appropriate  procedures  and  without  violating  the  fundamental  rights  of  the  suspect.1957 Both  the 
requirements relating to the collection, analysis, preservation and finally presentation of the evidence in 
court and the consequences of a violation of the suspect’s rights differ from country to country. Principles 
and rules that can possibly be violated range from fundamental rights of a suspect such as privacy1958 to 
failure to respect procedural requirements. Due to the often inadequate legislation, general principles of 
evidence are frequently applied to digital evidence.1959  
The requirements for the collection of digital evidence are mainly set by criminal procedural law. In most 
countries,  the  interception  of  content  data  for  example  requires  a  court  order  and  an  extension  of  a 
search to remote storage devices requires that they be located in the same country. If interception takes 
place  without  a  court  order,  the  appropriate  procedures  are  violated,  and  the  investigation  might 
therefore interfere with the rights of the suspect. The requirements for preservation of evidence are less 
often defined by law.1960 However, the fundamental principle of the necessity to protect the integrity of 
digital evidence is certainly a guideline.1961 Investigators need to make sure that evidence is not altered in 
any unauthorized manner from the time it was created, transmitted or stored by an authorized source.1962 
Protecting  integrity  is  necessary  in  order  to  ensure  reliability  and  accuracy  and  to  comply  with  the 
principle of legitimacy.1963 The procedures for the presentation of evidence in court are rarely defined by 
law. 
As stated above, not only the requirements but also the consequences of a violation of procedures and 
the rights of the suspect vary significantly.1964 While some countries consider evidence to be inadmissible 
only if collected in a manner which seriously violates the suspect’s rights (and not, for example, if only 
formal requirements were violated) and do not exclude such evidence, other countries – especially those 
applying the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine – apply other standards for admissibility.1965 

Best evidence rule 
For  common-law  jurisdictions,  the  best  evidence  rule  is  of  great  importance. 1966 There  are  some 
references, mostly in old cases, to a “best evidence rule”, which under common law provides that only the 
best available evidence of a fact at issue is said to be admissible. Whatever status this rule may once have 
enjoyed, however, there is now very little modern authority for its continued survival and some express 
assertions of its demise.1967  
The general rule now appears to be that whether a given item of evidence is the best available evidence 
or  not  only  affects  its  weight,  not  its  admissibility.1968 Closely  related  to  the  best  evidence  rule,  the 
“primary  evidence  rule”  formerly  provided  that  in  the case  of  documentary  evidence,  only  the  original 
document or an “enrolled” copy of that document was admissible to prove its contents and authenticity. 
However, the old rule has effectively been discarded by the courts, and any surviving remnants of this rule 
are  further  limited  in  criminal  proceedings  by  legislation  (which  now  generally  permits  the  use  of 
authenticated copies).1969  
The logic of requiring the production of an original document where it is available rather than relying on 
possibly unsatisfactory copies, or the recollections of witnesses, is clear1970, although modern techniques 
make objections to the first alternative weak. In the unavoidable absence of the best or primary evidence 

 

231 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
of documents, the court will accept secondary evidence. This is evidence which suggests, on the face of it, 
that other and better evidence exists. Public and judicial documents are usually proven by copies, without 
accounting  for  the  absence  of  the  originals;  and  a  statement  contained  in  any  document  may  now  be 
proven by the production of an authenticated copy of the document.1971 The underlying principle is that 
risks  of  mistranscriptions,  testimonial  misstatements  of  what  the  document  contains  and  undetected 
tampering  is  reduced.1972 The  rule  in  strict  interpretation  permits  secondary  evidence  (in  the  form  of  a 
copy) where the original has been lost.  
In  regard  to digital  evidence,  this  raises  a  number  of  questions,  insofar  as  it  is necessary  to  determine 
what the original is.1973 As digital data can in general be copied without loss of quality and a presentation 
of the original data in court is not in all cases possible, the best evidence rule seems to be incompatible 
with  digital  evidence.  But  courts  have  started  to  open  the  rule  to  new  developments  by  accepting  an 
electronic copy as well as the original document.1974 The best evidence rule in this broader interpretation 
does not require a written or witness testimony in every instance, but that the best obtainable evidence 
of its contents be used.1975 Moreover, the best evidence rule has been enshrined in most of the statutory 
regimes established in the common law region.1976  

Rule against hearsay 
The  rule  against  hearsay  is  another  principle  that  is  particularly  relevant  for  common  law  countries.1977 
Hearsay evidence is evidence given by a witness in court of a statement made by some other person out 
of  court,  when  such  evidence  is  tendered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  statement.1978 Under  common  law, 
hearsay evidence was generally inadmissible; but in civil proceedings this rule was abolished in the UK by 
the Civil Evidence Act 1995, which provides for the admissibility of hearsay evidence subject to statutory 
safeguards, and preserves a number of common law exceptions to the rule against hearsay.1979 
According to the common law rule against hearsay, an assertion other than one made by a person while 
giving oral evidence in the proceedings and tendered as evidence of the facts asserted is inadmissible1980. 
An out-of-court statement, for the purposes of the rule, means any statement other than one made by a 
witness in the course of giving his evidence, and could include, for example, a statement made in previous 
legal  proceedings.  Thus,  the  statement  may  have  been  made  unsworn  or  on  oath,  orally,  in  writing  or 
even by way of signs or gestures, by any person, whether or not called as a witness in the proceedings in 
question. 1981 In  addition,  the  rule  intends  to  enable  cross-examination  of  the  real  witness  and  expose 
weaknesses  in  a  statement.1982 Instead,  it  is  necessary  that  a  witness  with  personal  knowledge  directly 
proves this. Not only can a witness testimony contain inadmissible hearsay but also exhibits may contain 
inadmissible hearsay.1983 A number of reasons have been advanced to justify the common law rule against 
hearsay, such as the danger of manufactured evidence, relating to the potential unreliability of hearsay 
evidence. The rules governing the admissibility of hearsay evidence now apply if (and only if) the purpose, 
or one of the purposes, of the person making the statement appears to the court to have been to cause 
another person to believe the matter, or to cause another person to act or a machine to operate on the 
basis that the matter is as stated.1984  
Having regard to the fact that data collected during an investigation (such as log-files) intend to prove the 
truth of the matter asserted in the digital evidence itself, strict application of the rule is problematical in 
an age where very often digital evidence is the most relevant category of evidence in court proceedings, 
and some common law countries have started to implement statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule.1985 
Evidence  produced  by  computers,  cameras  or  other  machines  without  incorporating  any  human 
statement cannot be hearsay.1986 Under common law, it used to be held that visual images, even when 
produced by human hands, were not “statements” of any facts they purported to represent and therefore 
could not be hearsay. But there is now express provision to the contrary.1987 
Where  no  statutory  exceptions  exist,  the  application  of  the  rule  to  digital  evidence  is  questioned  by 
pointing  out  that  it  only  applies  to  statements  that  contain  within  them  assertions  made  by  human 
persons.  Information  generated  mechanically  without  human  intervention  would  on  this  basis  not  be 
considered as potentially hearsay evidence1988 unless the process of creating the software is used as an 
argument to apply the rule even in those cases.1989  

232 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Relevance/effectiveness 
Relevance and effectiveness are other common requirements for the admissibility of digital evidence.1990 
Taking into account the amount of data that is stored even on a private computer, only a tiny proportion 
of  which  might  be  relevant  for  the  case,  one  can  see  the  practical  importance  of  this  criterion  in 
cybercrime investigation. Its application is important both to restrict the collection of evidence and for the 
presentation  in  court.  Unlike  with  traditional  evidence,  where  during  the  collection  process  irrelevant 
pieces  of  evidence  can  simply  be  ignored,  the  selection  process  is  more  challenging  when  it  comes  to 
digital  evidence1991,  since  at  the  time  when  the  computer  hardware  is  seized  it  is  almost  impossible  to 
determine whether the storage devices concerned contain relevant information or not.  

Transparency 
Unlike traditional search and seizure operations, which are carried out openly and therefore guarantee 
that the suspect is aware that an investigation is being carried out, sophisticated investigation tools such 
as  the  real-time  interception  of  communications  do  not  require  such  disclosure.  Despite  the  technical 
ability, not all countries allow law-enforcement agencies to carry out covert operations, or at least require 
that the suspect be informed afterwards. Transparency during the whole process of collecting, processing 
and using evidence in court affords a suspect the possibility to question the legitimacy and relevance of 
collected evidence.  

Legal Framework 

6.3.9 
While substantive criminal law provisions covering the most common forms of computer crimes can today 
be found in a large number of countries, the situation with regard to digital evidence is different. Only a 
few  countries  have  so  far  addressed  specific  aspects  of  digital  evidence  and,  in  addition,  international 
binding standards are lacking.1992  

Commonwealth Electronic Evidence Model Law (2002) 
In 2000, the Law Ministers of Small Commonwealth Jurisdictions decided to establish a working group to 
develop model legislation on electronic evidence. The main comparative law analysis finding of the study 
group was that, with regard to the admissibility of digital evidence, the reliability of the system by which 
the  digital  evidence  was  created  is  more  important  than  the  document  itself.  The  model  law  from 
20021993,  which  was  based  on  legislation  from  Singapore1994 and  Canada1995,  reflects  these  findings  and 
covers  the  most  relevant  aspects  of  digital  evidence  with  regard  to  common  law  countries,  such  as 
application of the best evidence rule1996 and the integrity of digital evidence. 
 
General Admissibility  
3. Nothing in the rules of evidence shall apply to deny the admissibility of an electronic record in evidence 
on the sole ground that it is an electronic record. 
 
Section 3 contains a common element of legal frameworks seeking to regulate aspects of digital evidence 
which  can  be  found  in  similar  form,  for  example,  in  Article  5  of  the  1999  EU  Directive  on  digital 
signatures.1997 The  provision  intends  to  ensure  that  digital  evidence  is  not  inadmissible  per  se.  In  this 
respect, section 3 provides the foundation for the use of digital evidence in court proceedings. However, 
the admissibility of evidence is not guaranteed merely because the evidence is digital. It is necessary for 
the digital evidence to satisfy the ordinary rules of evidence. If the evidence is hearsay material, it does 
not become admissible because of section 3.  
 
Scope of the Act  
4. (1) This Act does not modify any common law or statutory rule relating to the admissibility or records, 
except the rules relating to authentication and best evidence. 
2) A court may have regard to evidence adduced under this Act in applying any common law or statutory 
rule relating to the admissibility of records. 

 

233 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
Application of the Best Evidence Rule 
6.  (1)  In  any  legal  proceeding,  subject  to  subsection  (b),  where  the  best  evidence  rule  is  applicable  in 
respect of electronic record, the rule is satisfied on proof of the integrity of the electronic records system in 
or by which the data was recorded or stored. 
(2)  In  any  legal  proceeding,  where  an  electronic  record  in  the  form  of  printout  has  been  manifestly  or 
consistently  acted  on,  relied  upon,  or  used  as  the  record  of  the  information  recorded  or  stored  on  the 
printout, the printout is the record for the purposes of the best evidence rule. 
 
As  described  above,  some  of  the  criteria  for  digital  evidence  are  in  potential  conflict  with  traditional 
principles related to the admissibility of evidence. This is especially relevant in regard to the best evidence 
rule, which is of great importance for common law countries.1998 The aim of the best evidence rule is to 
minimize  the  risks  of  mistranscriptions,  testimonial  misstatements  of  what  the  document  contains  and 
undetected  tampering.1999 Admissibility  of  evidence  requires  that  documentary  evidence  be  the  best 
evidence  available  to  the  party.  Whether  this  excludes  digital  evidence  per  se  is  a  matter  of 
controversy.2000 Sections 4 and 6 of the Commonwealth Electronic Evidence Model Law are examples of a 
statutory exemption. In this context, section 4 first of all clarifies that the model law modifies solely the 
principles of authentication and best evidence. Following this general clarification, section 6 modifies the 
best evidence rule to ensure that digital evidence is not inadmissible per se. Based on section 6, digital 
evidence is not inadmissible due to the best evidence rule provided that the integrity of the system that 
created the data can be proven. 

Commonwealth Model Law on Computer and Computer-related Crime (2002) 
In  2002,  the  Draft  Commonwealth  Model  Law  on  Computer  and  Computer-related  Crime  was 
presented.2001 In addition to substantive criminal law provisions and procedural instruments, it contains a 
specific provision dealing with digital evidence.

20 In proceedings for an offence against a law of [enacting country], the fact that:

The approach is similar to Article 3 of the more specific Commonwealth Electronic Evidence Model Law

Introduction 

6.4.1 
Cybercrime  is  a  typical  transnational  crime  that  involves  different  jurisdictions.  It  is  not  unusual  that 
several countries are affected. The offender might have acted from country A, used an Internet service in 
country B and the victim is based in country C. This is a challenge with regard to the application of criminal 
law2002 and  leads  to  questions  about  which  of  the  countries  has  jurisdiction,  which country  should  take 
forward  the  investigation  and  how  to  resolve  disputes.  While  this  case  looks  already  challenging  it  is 
necessary to take into consideration that if the offence, for example, involves cloud computing services 
even more jurisdictions may be triggered.2003 
The term “jurisdiction” is used to describe various different legal issues.2004 Based upon principles of public 
international law “jurisdiction” describes the authority of a sovereign state to regulate certain conduct.2005 
It is therefore one aspect of national sovereignty.2006 However, in the context of cybercrime investigation 
“jurisdiction” refers to the authority of a state to enforce its domestic law.2007 In general, law enforcement 
will only be able to carry out an investigation if the country has jurisdiction.  

Different principles of jurisdiction 

6.4.2 
It is possible to differentiate between different principles of jurisdiction.  

Principle of territoriality / principle of objective territoriality 

6.4.3 
The most fundamental principle and most common basis of jurisdiction is the principle of territoriality.2008 
It is applicable if an offence – regardless of the nationality of the offender or victim – is committed within 
the  territory  of  a  sovereign  state.2009 The  fact  that  jurisdiction  in  general  only  makes  sense  if  it  can  be 
enforced and enforcement of law requires control (that is in general limited to the territory) explains the 
relevance  of  the  principle.  One  approach  of  a  computer-specific  codification  of  the  principles  of 
territoriality is Article 22 paragraph 1.a Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  
 
Article 22 – Jurisdiction 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction 
over any offence established in accordance with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, when the offence 
is committed: 
 
 
 
 

a. in its territory; or 
b. on board a ship flying the flag of that Party; or 
c. on board an aircraft registered under the laws of that Party; or 
d. by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or 
if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State. 

[…] 

 
The  provision  is  computer  specific  as  it  only  refers  to  offences  listed  in  Article  2  to  11  Convention  on 
Cybercrime.  
However,  the  application  with  regard  to  cybercrime  cases  is  going  along  with  challenges.  A  crime  was 
certainly  committed  if  the  offender  and  the  victim  were  physically  present  in  the  country  while  the 
offender  illegally  accessed  the  victim’s  computer  system.  But  was  the  offence  committed  within  the 

 

235 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
territory of a state if the offender acted from abroad when accessing the computer system of the victim in 
the country?  
Those cases have an extraterritorial element. However, the International Court of Justices expressed in 
the “Lotus” case that even in cases where countries apply jurisdiction only on the basis of territoriality, 
extraterritorial  conduct  may  nevertheless  be  regarded  as  committed  in  the  territory  if  one  of  the 
constituent  elements  of  the  offence  (especially  its  effect)  have  taken  place  in  the  country.2010 This 
doctrine, that is also referred to as “principle of objective territoriality”2011 is highly relevant in cybercrime 
cases.2012 But taking into account that a malicious software that was sent out by an offender might affect 
computer  systems  in  various  countries  underlines  that  such  extensive  definition  of  territoriality  easily 
leads  to  possible  conflicts  of  jurisdiction.2013 The  risk  of  potential  conflicts  increases  even  more  if  the 
principle of territoriality is applied to cases where neither the offender nor victim are located within the 
country  but  only  the  infrastructure  within  a  country  was  used  within  the  commission  of  a  crime  –  for 
example  if  an  e-mail  with  illegal  content  was  sent  out  by  using  an e-mail  provider  in  one  country  or  a 
website with illegal content is stored on the server of a hosting provider in the country.  
One codification of such broad approach is section 11(3)(b) Singapore Computer Misuse Act 2007.  
 
Territorial scope of offences under this Act 
[…] 
11. —(1) Subject to subsection (2), the provisions of this Act shall have effect, in relation to any person, 
whatever his nationality or citizenship, outside as well as within Singapore. 
(2) Where an offence under this Act is committed by any person in any place outside Singapore, he may be 
dealt with as if the offence had been committed within Singapore. 
(3) For the purposes of this section, this Act shall apply if, for the offence in question — 
 
 

(a) the accused was in Singapore at the material time; or 
(b) the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time. 

This broad approach very likely even leads to an applicability of Singapore legislation with regard to data 
only transiting through computer systems in Singapore.2014  

Flag principle 

6.4.4 
The flag principle is closely related to the principle of territoriality but extends the application of domestic 
laws to aircrafts and ships. Taking into account the availability of Internet access solutions for maritime 
and air transportation,2015 raises questions related to the application of criminal law in cases where either 
the offender, victim or affected computer systems is not located in the territory but outside the territorial 
borders of country on board of a ship or aircraft.  
One example for an approach to regulate such cases is Article 22 paragraph 1.b and 1c Council of Europe 
Convention on Cybercrime.  
 
Article 22 – Jurisdiction 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction 
over any offence established in accordance with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, when the offence 
is committed: 
 
 
 
 

a. in its territory; or 
b. on board a ship flying the flag of that Party; or 
c. on board an aircraft registered under the laws of that Party; or 
d. by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or 
if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State. 

[…] 

 

236 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Effects doctrine / Protective principle  

 
6.4.5 
The  effects  doctrine  deals  with  the  establishment  of  jurisdiction  for  a  crime  committed  by  a  foreign 
national, occurring outside the territory with no element of the conduct taking place in the territory but 
still  having  a  substantial  effect  within  the  territory.2016 Closely  related  is  the  protective  principle  that 
establishes jurisdiction in similar cases where a fundamental national interest is triggered. Due to the fact 
of the absence of the offender, victim and used infrastructure, there are only weak links to a country and 
the application of the principle is controversially discussed.2017  

Principle of active nationality 

6.4.6 
The principle of nationality refers to jurisdiction exercised with regard to activities of nationals abroad.2018 
It is related to the power of the state to regulate the behaviour of its nationals not only within its territory 
but also abroad. This principle is more common in civil law countries than common law countries.2019 As a 
consequence common law countries tend to compensate the lack of jurisdiction based on the principle of 
nationality by a more extensive interpretation of the principle of territoriality.  
With regard to the fact that Internet-related crimes can be committed without leaving the country the 
principle is of less relevance when it comes to cybercrime cases. However, it can be highly relevant in the 
context  of  production  of  child  pornography  for  the  purpose  of  distributing  it  though  computer 
networks.2020  
One example for an approach to regulate the principle of nationality is Article 22 paragraph 1.d Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  
 
Article 22 – Jurisdiction 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction 
over any offence established in accordance with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, when the offence 
is committed: 
 
 
 
 

a. in its territory; or 
b. on board a ship flying the flag of that Party; or 
c. on board an aircraft registered under the laws of that Party; or 
d. by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or 
if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State. 

[…] 

Principle of passive nationality 

6.4.6 
The principle of passive nationality refers to jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victim. Taking into 
account the overlapping with the principle of territory, it is only relevant if a national became victim of a 
crime while being outside the country. The application of the principle is controversially discussed2021 – 
especially  because  it  indicates  that  foreign  law  is  insufficient  to  protect  foreigners  –  but  it  has  gained 
more acceptance in the last decades.2022  
One – non Internet-specific – codification of the principle of passive nationality is section 7 of the German 
Penal Code.  
 
Section 7 
Offences committed abroad—other cases 
(1)  German  criminal  law  shall  apply  to  offences  committed  abroad  against  a  German,  if  the  act  is  a 
criminal offence at the locality of its commission or if that locality is not subject to any criminal jurisdiction. 

Principle of universality  

6.4.7 
The universality principle established jurisdiction in relation to specific crimes that are in the interest of 
the international community.2023 This principle is especially relevant with regard to serious crimes such as 

 

237 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
crimes against humanity and war crimes.2024 However, various countries that recognise the principle have 
developed  it  further.2025 As  a  consequence  the  principle  is  under  certain  circumstances  even  applicable 
with regard to cybercrime.  
One  example  for  a  provision  that  can  be  applicable  in  cybercrime  cases  is  section  6(6)  of  the  German 
Penal Code.  
 
Section 6 
Offences committed abroad against internationally protected legal interests 
German criminal law shall further apply, regardless of the law of the locality where they are committed, to 
the following offences committed abroad: 
 
 

1. (repealed) ; 
2. offences involving nuclear energy, explosives and radiation under section 307 and section 308(1) 
to (4), section 309(2) and section 310; 
3. attacks on air and maritime traffic (section 316c); 
4. human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, for the purpose of work exploitation and 
assisting human trafficking (Sections 232 to 233a); 
5. unlawful drug dealing; 
6. distribution of pornography under sections 184a, 184b (1) to (3) and section 184c (1) to (3), also 
in conjunction with section 184d, 1st sentence; 

 
 

 
 

[...] 

Based upon section 6 (6) Germany may exercise jurisdiction with regard to Internet websites that offer 
child pornography for download even if the operator of the website is not located in Germany, the servers 
are not based in Germany and no German Internet user accessed the website.

Introduction 

6.5.1 
As explained in the sections above, the fight against cybercrime requires adequate substantive criminal 
law provisions.2026 At least in civil law countries, law-enforcement agencies will not be able to investigate 
crimes without those laws in place. But the requirement of law-enforcement agencies in the fight against 
cybercrime is not limited to substantive criminal law provisions.2027 In order to carry out the investigations 
they  need  to  undertake  –  in  addition  to  training  and  equipment  –  procedural  instruments  that  enable 
them to take the measures that are necessary to identify the offender and collect the evidence required 
for  the  criminal  proceedings.2028 These  measures  can  be  the  same  ones  that  are  undertaken  in  other 
investigations  not  related  to  cybercrime  –  but  having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  offender  does  not 
necessarily  need  to  be  present  at  or  even  close  to  the  crime  scene,  it  is  very  likely  that  cybercrime 
investigations need to be carried out in a different way compared to traditional investigations.2029  
The reason why different investigation techniques are necessary is not only due to the independence of 
place  of  action  and  the  crime  scene.  It  is  in  most  cases  a  combination  of  a  number  of  the  above-
mentioned challenges for law-enforcement agencies that make cybercrime investigations unique.2030 If the 
offender is based in a different country2031, uses services that enable anonymous communication and, in 
addition,  commits  the  crimes  by  using  different  public  Internet  terminals,  the  crime  can  hardly  be 
investigated based on traditional instruments like search and seizure alone. To avoid misunderstanding, it 
is  important  to  point  out  that  cybercrime  investigations  require  classic  detective  work  as  well  as  the 
application of traditional investigation instruments – but cybercrime investigations face challenges that 
cannot be solved solely using traditional investigation instruments.2032  
Some  countries  have  already  developed  new  instruments  to  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to 
investigate cybercrime, as well as traditional crimes that require the analysis of computer data.2033 As is 
the  case  with  regard to the  substantive  criminal  law,  the  Council of  Europe  Convention  on Cybercrime 
contains  a  set  of  provisions  that  reflect  wide  accepted  minimum  standards  regarding  procedural 
instruments required for cybercrime investigations.2034 The following overview will therefore refer to the 
instruments offered by this international convention and in addition highlight national approaches that go 
beyond the regulations of the Convention on Cybercrime. 

Computer and Internet investigations (Computer Forensics) 

6.5.2 
The  term  computer  forensics  is  used  to  describe  the  systematic  collection  of  data  and  analysis  of 
computer technology with the purpose of searching for digital evidence.2035 Such analysis generally takes 

 

239 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
place  after  the  crime  was  committed.2036 It  is  thus  a  major  part  of  computer  crime  and  cybercrime 
investigation.  Investigators  carrying out such investigations are confronted with several challenges that 
are described in more detail in Chapter 3.  
The extent of the possible involvement of experts in computer forensics demonstrates its importance in 
the  investigation  process.  In  addition,  the  dependence  of  the  success  of  Internet  investigations  on  the 
availability of forensic resources highlights the need for training in this area. Only if the investigators are 
either trained in computer forensics or have access to experts in the area can efficient investigation and 
prosecution of cybercrime be conducted.  

Definition 
There  are  various  definitions  of  “computer  forensics”.2037 It  can  be  defined  as  “the  examination  of  IT 
equipment  and  systems  in  order  to  obtain  information  for  criminal  or  civil  investigation”.2038 When 
committing crimes, offenders leave traces.2039 This statement is valid in traditional investigations as well as 
computer  investigations.  The  main  difference  between  a  traditional  investigation  and  a  cybercrime 
investigation  is  that  a  cybercrime  investigation  generally  requires  specific  data-related  investigation 
techniques  and  can  be  facilitated  by  specialized  software  tools.2040 In  addition  to  adequate  procedural 
instruments, carrying  out  such  analysis  requires  that the  authorities  possess  the ability  to  manage  and 
analyse  the  relevant  data.  Depending  on  the  offences  and  the  computer  technology  involved,  the 
requirements  in  terms  of  procedural  investigation  tools  and  forensic  analysis  techniques  differ2041 and 
present unique challenges.2042  

is 

in  general  possible  to  distinguish  between  two  major  phases: 2043  the 

Phases of forensic investigations 
investigation  phase 
It 
(identification  of  relevant  evidence,2044 collection  and  preservation  of  evidence,2045 analysis  of  computer 
technology and digital evidence) and the presentation and use of evidence in court proceedings. In order 
to explain the different activities, the following chapter expands the model to four phases. 

Evidence identification procedures  
Increasing hard drive capacities2046 and the falling cost2047 of the storage of digital documents compared to 
the storage of physical documents is generating constant growth in the number of digital documents.2048 
Given the need to focus investigations  on relevant evidence in order to prevent inadmissibility, special 
attention  must  be  paid  to  the  identification  of  evidence.2049 Consequently,  forensic  experts  play  an 
important role in the design of investigation strategies and the selection of relevant evidence. They can, 
for  example,  determine  the  location  of  relevant  evidence  on  large  storage  systems.  This  enables 
investigators to limit the scope of the investigation to those parts of the computer infrastructure that are 
relevant for the investigation and avoid inappropriate and large-scale seizure of computer hardware.2050 
This  selection  process  is  relevant  as  various  types  of  storage  device  are  available  that  can  make 
identification  of  the  storage  location  of  relevant  evidence  challenging.2051 This  is  especially  valid  if  the 
suspect is not storing information locally but uses means of remote storage. The availability of broadband 
access and remote storage servers has influenced the way information is stored. If the suspect is storing 
information on a server that is located in another country, this simple act can make it more difficult to 
seize evidence. Forensic analysis can in this case be used to determine whether remote-storage services 
were used.2052 Identification of relevant digital information is not confined to files themselves. Databases 
of  software  tools  that  are  made  available  by  operating  systems  to  quickly  identify  files  might  contain 
relevant information, too.2053 Even system-generated temporary files might contain evidence for criminal 
proceedings.2054  
Another example of evidence identification is the involvement of forensic experts in determining the right 
procedural instruments. A number of countries enable law-enforcement agencies to carry out two types 
of real-time observation – the collection of traffic data in real time, and the interception of content data 
in real time. In general, the interception of content data is more intrusive than the collection of traffic 
data.  Forensic  experts  can  determine  whether  the  collection  of  traffic  data  is  sufficient  to  prove  the 
committing of a crime, and thereby help investigators to strike the right balance between the need to 

240 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
collect  effective  evidence  and  the  obligation  to  protect  the  rights  of  the  suspect  by  choosing  the  least 
intensive  instrument  out  of  the  group  of  equally  effect  options.  Both  examples  show  that  the  role  of 
forensic  investigators  is  not  restricted  to  the  technical  aspects  of  an  investigation,  but  includes  a 
responsibility for protecting the suspect’s fundamental rights and thereby avoiding inadmissibility of the 
evidence collected.2055  

Collection and preservation of the evidence  
Involvement  in  the  collection  of  digital  evidence  requires  complex  skills,  since  the  techniques  used  to 
collect evidence that is stored on the hard drive of a home computer and those employed to intercept a 
data-  transmission  process  are  significantly  different.  Especially  when  it  comes  to  high  level-offenders, 
investigators are often confronted with situations that call for quick decisions. One example is whether a 
running computer system should be turned off or not, and how this procedure should be carried out. To 
avoid interfering with the integrity of relevant digital evidence, a common instruction is to pull the plug, 
as this stops any alteration of files.2056 However, such a disruption of  energy can activate encryption2057 
and  thereby  hinder  access  to  stored  data.2058 First  responders,  who  undertake  the  first  steps  to  collect 
digital  evidence,  bear  a  significant  responsibility  for  the  entire  investigation  process,  as  any  wrong 
decision  can  have  a  major  impact  on  the  ability  to  preserve  relevant  evidence.2059 If  they  make  wrong 
decisions on preservation, important traces can be lost.  
Forensic experts need to ensure that all relevant evidence is identified.2060 This can be difficult if offenders 
hide files in a storage device in order to prevent law-enforcement agencies from analysing the content of 
the  file.  Forensic  investigations  can  identify  hidden  files  and  make  them  accessible.2061 Similar  recovery 
processes are necessary if digital information has been deleted.2062 Files that are deleted by simply placing 
them in a virtual trash bin does not necessarily render them unavailable to law-enforcement agencies, as 
they may be recovered using special forensic software tools.2063 However, if offenders are using tools to 
ensure  that  files  are  securely  deleted  by  overwriting  the  information,  recovery  is  in  general  not 
possible.2064 The collection of evidence can also face challenges if criminals are trying to prevent access to 
relevant  information  by  using  encryption  technology.  Such  technology  is  more  and  more  frequently 
used.2065 Given that this prevents law-enforcement agencies from accessing and examining the encrypted 
information,  the  use  of  encryption  technology  entails  significant  challenges  for  law-enforcement 
agencies.2066 Forensic experts can try to decrypt encrypted files.2067 If this is not possible, they can support 
law-enforcement agencies in developing strategies to gain access to encrypted files, for example by using 
a keylogger.2068  
Involvement  in  the  collection  of  evidence  includes  the  evaluation  and  implementation  of  new 
instruments. One example of a new approach is the debate on remote forensic tools.2069 Remote forensic 
tools  enable  investigators  to  collect  evidence  remotely  in  real  time2070 or  remotely  monitor  a  suspect’s 
activity2071 without the suspect being aware of investigations on his system. Where such a tool is available, 
it can play a role in the development of a strategy to collect digital evidence.  

Communication with service providers 
Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  play  an  important  role  in  many  cybercrime  investigations,  since  most 
users are utilizing their services to access the Internet or store websites. The fact that in some cases the 
ISPs have the technical capability to detect and prevent crimes and to support law-enforcement agencies 
in their investigations has prompted an intensive debate on the role of ISPs in cybercrime investigations. 
Obligations discussed range from the mandatory implementation of prevention technology to voluntary 
support of investigations.2072 Forensic experts can also support an investigation by preparing requests that 
are  submitted  to  service  providers 2073 and  assisting  the  investigators  in  producing  adequate  case 
histories2074 which are necessary to prove the reliability of the collected evidence. Cooperation between 
law-enforcement  agencies  and 
investigations  requires  the  application  of  certain 
procedures.2075 The  Council  of  Europe  Guidelines  for  the  Cooperation  of  Law  Enforcement  and  ISPs2076 
contain a set of fundamental procedures, including issues such as providing explanations and assistance 
regarding investigation techniques2077 and prioritization,2078 and the assistance of forensic experts can be 
useful in this respect to improve the efficiency of procedures.  

in  such 

ISPs 

 

241 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Close  cooperation  with  ISPs  is  especially  relevant  in  connection  with  the  identification  of  a  suspect. 
Suspects who commit cybercrime do leave traces.2079 Traffic data analysis, like the examination of log-files 
kept  by  ISPs,  can  lead  the  investigators  to  the  connection  used  by  the  offender  to  log  on  to  the 
Internet.2080 Offenders  can  try  to  hinder  investigations  by  making  use  of  anonymous  communication 
technology.2081 But even in this case, investigations are not impossible if investigators and ISPs cooperate 
closely. 2082 One example is the forensic tool CIPAV (Computer and Internet Protocol Address Verifier) that 
was  used  in  the  US  to  identify  a  suspect  who  had  been  using  anonymous  communication  services.2083 
Another  example  of  cooperation  between  ISPs  and  investigators  is  e-mail  investigation.  E-mails  have 
become  a  very  popular  means  of  communication.2084 To  avoid  identification,  offenders  sometimes  use 
free e-mail addresses which they were able to register using fake personal information. However, even in 
this case, examination of header information2085 and log-files of the e-mail provider will in some instances 
enable identification of the suspect. 
The need to cooperate and communicate with providers is not limited to ISPs. Since some crimes such as 
phishing2086 and  the  commercial  distribution  of  child  pornography  include  financial  transactions,  one 
strategy  to 
in  the 
transactions.2087 One  example  is  an  investigation  in  Germany  where  offenders  who  downloaded  child 
pornography from a commercial website were identified on the basis of credit-card records. Based on a 
request  from  the  investigators,  the  credit-card  companies  analysed  their  customer  records  to  identify 
customers  who  used  their  credit  card  to  purchase  child  pornography  on  the  specific  website.2088 Such 
investigations are more challenging when anonymous payment methods are used.2089  

is  to  obtain  data  from  financial 

identify  the  offender 

institutions 

involved 

Examination of ICT  
The first step in most investigations is to prove that the offender had the ability to commit the crime. One 
of the main tasks of forensic experts is the examination of seized hardware and software.2090 Checks can 
either be performed on the spot during the search of the suspect’s premises2091 or after seizure. To enable 
such investigation, first responders usually seize all relevant storage devices – each of them potentially 
carrying  millions  of  files  that  quite  often  pose  a  logistical  challenge.2092 As  pointed  out  above,  the 
principles  of  relevance  and  effectiveness  are  of  great  importance  for  the  admissibility  of  digital 
evidence.2093 Identifying and selecting the relevant hardware is therefore one of the major tasks within an 
investigation.2094  
An analysis of available hardware components can, for example, prove that the suspect’s computer was 
capable  of  carrying  out  a  denial-of-service  attack 2095  or  is  equipped  with  a  chip  that  prevents 
manipulations  of  the  operating  system.  Hardware  analysis  can  also  be  necessary  in  the  process  of 
identifying a suspect. Some operating systems analyse the hardware configuration of a computer system 
during an installation process and submit it to the software producer. If the suspect’s hardware profile 
can be detected based on information from the software company, hardware analysis can be helpful to 
verify that the seized computer system matches. Hardware analysis does not necessarily mean focusing 
on physical components attached to a computer system. Most operating systems keep logs of hardware 
that was attached to a computer system during an operation.2096 Based on the entries in log files such as 
the Windows Registry, forensic examiners can even identify hardware that was used in the past but was 
not present during the search and seizure procedure.  
In  addition  to  hardware  analysis,  software  analysis  is  a  regular  task  in  cybercrime  investigations. 
Computer  software  is  necessary  to  operate  a  computer  system.  In  addition  to  the  operating  systems, 
additional software tools can be installed to gear the functioning of computer systems to the demand of 
the user. Forensic experts can analyse the functioning of software tools in order to prove that a suspect 
was  capable  of  committing  a  specific  crime.  They  can,  for  example,  investigate  whether  the  suspect’s 
computer system contains a software that enables the encryption of data in pictures (steganography2097). 
An  inventory  of  software  tools  installed  on  the  suspect’s  computer  can  also  help  to  design  further 
investigation strategies. If, for example, the investigators find encryption software or tools used to delete 
files  securely,  they  can  specifically  search  for  encrypted  or  deleted  evidence.2098 Investigators  can  also 
determine  the  functions  of  computer  viruses  or  other  forms  of  malicious  software  and  reconstruct 
software-operation  processes.2099 In  some  cases,  where  illegal  content  has  been  found  on  suspects’ 

242 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
computers, the suspects have claimed that they did not download the files but that it must have been 
done  by  computer  virus.  In  such  cases,  forensic  investigations  can  try  to  identify  malicious  software 
installed on the computer system and determine its functions. Similar investigations can be carried out if a 
computer system could have been infected and turned into part of a botnet.2100 Furthermore, software 
analysis can be important to determine if a software is produced solely for committing crimes or can be 
used for legitimate as well as illegal purposes (dual use). This differentiation can be relevant, insofar as 
some countries limit criminalization of the production of illegal devices to those that are either solely or 
primarily designed to commit crimes.2101 
Data-related investigations  are not confined to the software function, but also include analysis of non-
executable files such as pdf-documents or video files. These investigations range from content analysis of 
specific  files  to  automatic  keyword  search2102 for  text  files  and  image  search  for  known  images  on  the 
suspect’s computer.2103 File analysis also includes the examination of digital documents that might have 
been  forged2104 as  well  as  metadata  investigation.2105 Such  analysis  can  determine  the  time2106 the 
document was last opened or modified.2107 Furthermore, metadata analysis can be used to identify the 
author of a file containing a threatening message, or the serial number of the camera that was used to 
produce a child-pornography image. Authors can also be identified based on linguistic analysis, which can 
assist  in  determining  if  the  suspect  has  written  articles  before  and  left  information  that  can  help 
identification in this context.2108  

Tracking and reporting 
One of the greatest challenges related to digital evidence is the fact that it is highly fragile and can rather 
easily  be  deleted2109 or  modified.2110 As  pointed  out  above,  one  consequence  of  the  fragility  of  digital 
evidence is the need to maintain its integrity.2111 Case records are therefore required. The involvement of 
qualified  experts 2112 in  the  production  of  case  records  is  one  approach  to  maintaining  the  integrity  of 
evidence where forensic experts can be involved.2113 But forensic experts also play a role when the seizure 
of  hardware  is  either  impossible  or  inadequate.  In  those  cases,  some  countries  enable  investigators  to 
copy files. Special attention then needs to be paid to protecting the integrity of copied files against any 
kind of alteration during the copy process.2114  

Presentation of the evidence in court 
The  final  phase  of  investigations  is  in  general  the  presentation  of  evidence  in  court.  While  the 
presentation  of  evidence  in  court  is  customarily  undertaken  by  the  prosecution  and  defence  lawyers, 
forensic experts can play an important role in criminal proceedings as expert witnesses who can help the 
people involved in the court proceedings to understand the processes by which the evidence was created, 
the procedures used to collect the evidence and evaluation of the evidence.2115 Given the complexity of 
digital  evidence,  the  need  to  involve  forensic  experts  increases,  which  leads  de  facto  to  a  reliance  of 
judges, juries, prosecutors and lawyers on expert statements.2116 

Forensic examination operations 
Although computer forensics deals to a large degree with computer hardware and computer data, it is not 
necessarily always automated, and computer forensics remains to a large extent manual work.2117 This is 
especially true with regard to the development of strategies and the search for possible evidence within 
search and seizure procedures. The amount of time necessary for such manual operations and the ability 
of  offenders  to  automate  their  attacks  underline  the  challenges  that  law-enforcement  agencies  face, 
especially  in  investigations  involving  a  large  number  of  suspects  and  large  data  volumes.2118 However, 
some processes like the search for suspicious keywords or the recovery of deleted files can be automated 
using special forensic analysis tools.2119 

Safeguards 

6.5.3 
Over the last few years, law-enforcement agencies around the world have highlighted the urgent need for 
adequate  investigation  instruments.2120 Taking  this  into  consideration,  it  is  perhaps  surprising  that  the 
Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  has  been  criticized  with  regard  to  procedural 

 

243 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
instruments.2121 The criticism focuses mainly on the aspect that the Convention on Cybercrime contains a 
number  of  provisions  that  establish  investigation  instruments  (Articles  16-21)  but  only  one  provision 
(Article 15)  that  deals  with  safeguards.2122 In  addition,  it  can  be  noted  that  unlike  for  the  substantive 
criminal law provisions in the Convention on Cybercrime, there are only very few possibilities for national 
adjustments in respect of the implementation of the Convention on Cybercrime.2123 The criticism as such 
focuses mainly on the quantitative aspects. It is correct that the Convention on Cybercrime follows the 
concept of centralized regulation of safeguards instead of attaching them individually to each instrument. 
But this does not necessarily mean a weaker protection of suspects’ rights.  
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  was  designed  from  the  outset  as  an  international 
framework  and  instrument  for  the  fight  against  cybercrime  that  is  not  limited  solely  to  the  Council  of 
Europe member countries.2124 While negotiating the necessary procedural instruments, the drafters of the 
Convention on Cybercrime, which included representatives from non-European countries like the United 
States and Japan, realized that the existing national approaches related to safeguards and especially the 
way these protected the suspect in the various criminal law systems were so different that it would not be 
possible  to  provide  one  detailed  solution  for  all  Member  States.2125 The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime therefore decided not to include specific regulations in the text of the Convention, but instead 
to request Member States to ensure that fundamental national and international standards of safeguards 
are applied.2126  
 
Article 15 – Conditions and safeguards 
1.  Each  Party  shall  ensure  that  the  establishment,  implementation  and  application  of  the  powers  and 
procedures  provided  for  in  this  Section  are  subject  to  conditions  and  safeguards  provided  for  under  its 
domestic  law,  which  shall  provide  for  the  adequate  protection  of  human  rights  and  liberties,  including 
rights arising pursuant to obligations it has undertaken under the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for 
the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  1966  United  Nations  International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other applicable international human rights instruments, and 
which shall incorporate the principle of proportionality. 
2. Such conditions and safeguards shall, as appropriate in view of the nature of the procedure or power 
concerned, inter alia, include judicial or other independent supervision, grounds justifying application, and 
limitation of the scope and the duration of such power or procedure. 
3.  To  the  extent  that  it  is  consistent  with  the  public  interest,  in  particular  the  sound  administration  of 
justice, each Party shall consider the impact of the powers and procedures in this section upon the rights, 
responsibilities and legitimate interests of third parties. 
 
Article 15 is based on the principle that the signatory states shall apply the conditions and safeguards that 
already  exist  under  domestic  law.  If  the  law  provides  central  standards  that  apply  to  all  investigation 
instruments, these principles shall apply to Internet-related instruments as well.2127 In case the domestic 
law is not based on a centralized regulation of safeguards and conditions, it is necessary to analyse the 
safeguards  and  conditions  implemented  with  regard  to  traditional  instruments  that  are  comparable  to 
Internet-related instruments. 
But the Convention on Cybercrime does not refer solely to existing safeguards in national legislation. This 
would  have  the  drawback  that  the  requirements  for  application  would  differ  in  such  a  way  that  the 
positive  aspects  of  harmonization  would  no  longer  apply.  To  ensure  that  signatory  states  which  might 
have  differing  legal  traditions  and  safeguards  in  place  implement  certain  standards2128,  the  Council  of 
Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  defines  the  minimum  standards  by  referring  to  fundamental 
frameworks,  such  as  the  1950  Council  of  Europe  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and 
Fundamental Freedoms, the 1966 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
other applicable international human rights instruments. 
As the Convention on Cybercrime can be signed and ratified also by countries that are not members of the 
Council of Europe2129, it is important to highlight that not only the United Nations International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights but also the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 

244 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
and Fundamental Freedoms will be taken into consideration when evaluating the systems of safeguards in 
signatory states that are not members of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  
With regard to cybercrime investigation, one of the most relevant provisions in Article 15 of the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime is the reference to Article 8, paragraph 2 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights.  
 
Art. 8 
1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in 
accordance  with  the  law  and  is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of  national  security, 
public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the 
protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. 
 
The  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  has  undertaken  efforts  to  define  more  precisely  standards  that 
govern electronic investigations and especially surveillance. Today, case law has become one of the most 
important sources for international standards in respect of investigations related to communication.2130 
The case law takes particularly into consideration the gravity of the interference of the investigation2131, its 
purpose2132 and its proportionality.2133 Fundamental principles that can be extracted from case law are: the 
need for a sufficient legal basis for investigation instruments2134, the requirement that the legal basis must 
be  clear  with  regard  to  the  subject2135,  competences  of  the  law-enforcement  agencies  need  to  be 
foreseeable2136 and surveillance of communication can only be justified in context of serious crimes.2137 
In addition to this, Article 15 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime takes into account the 
principle  of  proportionality.2138 This  provision  is  especially  relevant  for  signatory  states  that  are  not 
members of the Council of Europe. In cases where the existing national system of safeguards does not 
adequately  protect  suspects,  it  is  mandatory  for  Member  States  to  develop  the  necessary  safeguards 
within the ratification and implementation process.  
Finally,  Article 15  paragraph  2  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  explicitly  refers  to 
some  of  the  most  relevant  safeguards,2139 including  supervision,  grounds  justifying  application,  and 
limitation of procedure with regard to scope and duration. 
Unlike  the  fundamental  principles  described  above,  the  safeguards  mentioned  here  do  not  necessarily 
need to be implemented with regard to any instrument but only if appropriate in view of the nature of 
the procedure concerned. The decision as to when this is the case is left to the national legislatures.2140 
An important aspect related to the system of safeguards provided by the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime is the fact that the ability of law-enforcement agencies to use the instruments in a flexible 
way  on  the  one  hand  and  the  guarantee  of  effective  safeguards  on  the  other  depends  on  the 
implementation  of  a  graded  system  of  safeguards.  The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  explicitly 
hinder the parties from implementing the same safeguards (e.g. the requirement of a court order) for all 
instruments, but such an approach would influence the flexibility of the law-enforcement agencies. The 
ability  to  ensure  an  adequate  protection  of  the  suspect’s  rights  within  a  graded  system  of  safeguards 
depends  largely  on  balancing  the  potential  impact  of  an  investigation  instrument  with  the  related 
safeguards. To achieve this it is necessary to differentiate between less and more intensive instruments. 
There  are  a  number  of  examples  of  such  differentiation  in  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime that enable the parties to further develop a system of graded safeguards. These include the 
following:  Differentiation  between  the  interception  of  content  data  (Article 21)2141 and  the  collection  of 
traffic data (Article 20)2142. Unlike the collection of traffic data, the interception of content data is limited 
to serious crimes.2143 Differentiation between the order for an expedited preservation of stored computer 
data (Article 16)2144 and the submission of the preserved computer data based on the production order 
(Article 18).2145 Article 16 only enables law enforcement agencies to order the preservation of data but not 
their  disclosure. 2146  And  finally,  differentiation  between  the  obligation  to  submit  “subscriber 
information”2147 and “computer data”2148 in Article 18.2149  

 

245 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
If  the  intensity  of  an  investigation  instrument  and  the  potential  impact  on  a  suspect  are  correctly 
evaluated and the safeguards are designed in line with the results of the analysis, the system of graded 
safeguards does not lead to an unbalanced system of procedural instruments.  

6.5.4 

Expedited  preservation  and  disclosure  of  stored  computer  data  (Quick  freeze 
procedure) 

The identification of an offender who has committed a cybercrime often requires the analysis of traffic 
data.2150 The IP address, in particular, can help law-enforcement agencies to trace the offender.  As long as 
the law-enforcement agencies have access to the relevant traffic data, it is in some cases even possible to 
identify an offender who is using public Internet terminals that do not require identification.2151  
One of the main difficulties that investigators face is that traffic data highly relevant for the information in 
question are often automatically deleted after a rather short period of time. The reason for this automatic 
deletion  is  the  fact  that,  after  the  end  of  a  process  (e.g. the  sending  out  of  an  e-mail,  accessing  the 
Internet or downloading a movie), the traffic data that were generated during the process and enabled 
the  process  to  be  carried  out  are  no  longer  needed.  From  an  economic  point  of  view,  most  Internet 
providers are interested in deleting the information as soon as possible, since storing the data for longer 
periods would require even larger (expensive) storage capacity.2152  
However, the economic aspects do not constitute the only reason why law-enforcement agencies need to 
carry out their investigations quickly. Some countries have strict laws that prohibit the storage of certain 
traffic data after the end of a process. One example of such restriction is Article 6 of the European Union’s 
Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communication.2153 
 
Article 6 – Traffic data  
1.  Traffic  data  relating  to  subscribers  and  users  processed  and  stored  by  the  provider  of  a  public 
communications network or publicly available electronic communications service must be erased or made 
anonymous when it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication without 
prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of this Article and Article 15(1).  
2.  Traffic  data  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  subscriber  billing  and  interconnection  payments  may  be 
processed.  Such  processing  is  permissible  only  up  to  the  end  of  the  period  during  which  the  bill  may 
lawfully be challenged or payment pursued.  
 
Time is therefore a critical aspect of Internet investigations. In general, since it is likely that some time will 
elapse  between  the  perpetration  of  a  crime,  its  discovery,  and  notification  of  the  law-enforcement 
agencies, it is important to implement mechanisms that prevent relevant data from being deleted during 
the sometimes lengthy investigation process. In this regard, two different approaches are currently being 
discussed,2154 namely data retention and data preservation (“quick freeze procedure”). 
A data-retention obligation forces the provider of Internet services to save traffic data for a certain period 
of time.2155 In the latest legislative approaches, the records need to be saved for up to 24 months.2156 This 
would  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to  obtain  access  to  data  that  are  necessary  to  identify  an 
offender  even  months  after  perpetration  of  the  crime.2157 A  data-retention  obligation  was  recently 
adopted  by  the  European  Parliament2158 and  is  currently  also  under  discussion  in  the  United  States.2159 
With regard to the principles of data retention, more information can be found below.  

Convention on Cybercrime 
Data  preservation  is  a  different  approach  to  ensuring  that  a  cybercrime  investigation  does  not  fail  just 
investigation  proceedings. 2160  Based  on  data-
because  traffic  data  were  deleted  during 
preservation legislation, law-enforcement agencies can order a service provider to prevent the deletion of 
certain data. The expedited preservation of computer data is a tool that should enable law-enforcement 
agencies  to  react  immediately  and  avoid  the  risk  of  deletion  as  a  result  of  lengthy  procedures.2161 The 
drafters  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  decided  to  focus  on  “data  preservation” 
rather than “data retention”.2162 A regulation can be found in Article 16 of the Convention.

Article 16 – Expedited preservation of stored computer data 
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to enable its competent 
authorities to order or similarly obtain the expeditious preservation of specified computer data, including 
traffic data, that has been stored by means of a computer system, in particular where there are grounds to 
believe that the computer data is particularly vulnerable to loss or modification. 
2. Where a Party gives effect to paragraph 1 above by means of an order to a person to preserve specified 
stored computer data in the person’s possession or control, the Party shall adopt such legislative and other 
measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  oblige  that  person  to  preserve  and  maintain  the  integrity  of  that 
computer data for a period of time as long as necessary, up to a maximum of ninety days, to enable the 
competent authorities to seek its disclosure. A Party may provide for such an order to be subsequently 
renewed. 
3. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to oblige the custodian 
or  other  person  who  is  to  preserve  the  computer  data  to  keep  confidential  the  undertaking  of  such 
procedures for the period of time provided for by its domestic law. 
4. The powers and procedures referred to in this article shall be subject to Articles 14 and 15. 
 
Seen from an Internet service provider’s perspective, data preservation is a less constraining instrument 
compared to data retention.2163 ISPs do not need to store all data for all users, but instead have to ensure 
that  specific  data  are  not  deleted  as  soon  as  they  receive  an  order  from  a  competent  authority.  Data 
preservation offers advantages insofar as it covers data preservation not only from a provider’s point of 
view but also from the data-protection perspective. It is not necessary to preserve the data from millions 
of  Internet  users  but  only  data  that  are  related  to  possible  suspects  in  criminal  investigations. 
Nevertheless, it is important to point out that data retention offers advantages in cases where data are 
deleted immediately after a crime is perpetrated. In such cases, the data-preservation order would, unlike 
a data-retention obligation, not be able to prevent the deletion of the relevant data.  
The  order  pursuant  to  Article 16  only  obliges  the  provider  to  save  data  that  were  processed  by  the 
provider and not deleted at the time the provider receives the order.2164 It is not limited to traffic data, as 
traffic data is just mentioned as one example. Article 16 does not force the provider to start collecting 
information it would not normally store.2165 In addition, Article 16 does not oblige the provider to transfer 
the relevant data to the authorities. The provision only authorizes law-enforcement agencies to prevent 
the  deletion  of  the  relevant  data  but  not  to  pledge  the  providers  to  transfer  the  data.  The  transfer 
obligation  is  regulated  in  Articles 17  and 18  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime.  The 
advantage of a separation of the obligation to preserve the data and the obligation to disclose them is the 
fact that it is possible to require different conditions for application of the two obligations.2166 In view of 
the importance of immediate reaction, it would for example be supportive to waive the requirement for 
an order by a judge and enable the prosecution or police to order the preservation.2167 This would enable 
the  competent  authorities  to  react  faster.  Protection  of  the  suspect’s  rights  can  then  be  achieved  by 
requiring a judge’s order for the disclosure of the data.2168  
The  disclosure  of  the  preserved  data  is  among  other  aspects  regulated  in  Article 18  of  the  Council  of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime: 
 
Article 18 – Production order 
1.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its 
competent authorities to order: 
 

a. a person in its territory to submit specified computer data in that person’s possession or control, 
which is stored in a computer system or a computer-data storage medium; and 
b.  a  service  provider  offering  its  services  in  the  territory  of  the  Party  to  submit  subscriber 
information relating to such services in that service provider’s possession or control. 

 

2. The powers and procedures referred to in this article shall be subject to Articles 14 and 15. 

 

247 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
3. For the purpose of this article, the term “subscriber information” means any information contained in 
the form of computer data or any other form that is held by a service provider, relating to subscribers of its 
services other than traffic or content data and by which can be established: 
 

a. the type of communication service used, the technical provisions taken thereto and the period of 
service; 
b.  the  subscriber’s  identity,  postal  or  geographic  address,  telephone  and  other  access  number, 
billing and payment information, available on the basis of the service agreement or arrangement; 
c. any other information on the site of the installation of communication equipment, available on 
the basis of the service agreement or arrangement. 

 

 

 
Based on Article 18 paragraph 1.a of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the providers that 
have preserved the data can be obliged to disclose the data.  
Article 18 of the Convention on Cybercrime is not only applicable after a preservation order pursuant to 
Article 16  of  the  Convention  has  been  issued.2169 The  provision  is  a  general  instrument  that  law-
enforcement agencies can make use of. If the receiver of the production order voluntarily transfers the 
requested data, law-enforcement agencies are not restricted to seizing the hardware, but can apply the 
less constraining production order. Compared to the actual seizure of hardware, the order to submit the 
relevant information is in general less constraining. Its application is therefore especially relevant in cases 
where forensic investigations do not require access to the hardware.  
In addition to the obligation to submit computer data, Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime  enables  law-enforcement  agencies  to  order  the  submission  of  subscriber  information.  This 
investigation  instrument  is  of  great  importance  in  IP-based  investigations.  If  the  law-enforcement 
agencies are able to identify an IP-address that was used by the offender while carrying out the offence, 
they  will  need  to  identify  the  person2170 who  used  the  IP-address  at  the  time  of  the  offence.  Based  on 
Article 18, paragraph 1.b of the Convention on Cybercrime, a provider is obliged to submit the subscriber 
information listed in Article 18, paragraph 3.2171  
In cases where the law-enforcement agencies trace back the route to an offender and need immediate 
access to identify the path through which the communication was transmitted, Article 17 enables them to 
order the expedited partial disclosure of traffic data.  
 
Article 17 – Expedited preservation and partial disclosure of traffic data 
1. Each Party shall adopt, in respect of traffic data that is to be preserved under Article 16, such legislative 
and other measures as may be necessary to: 
 

a. ensure that such expeditious preservation of traffic data is available regardless of whether one or 
more service providers were involved in the transmission of that communication; and 
b. ensure the expeditious disclosure to the Party’s competent authority, or a person designated by 
that  authority,  of  a  sufficient  amount  of  traffic  data  to  enable  the  Party  to  identify  the  service 
providers and the path through which the communication was transmitted. 

2. The powers and procedures referred to in this article shall be subject to Articles 14 and 15. 
 
As mentioned above, the Convention on Cybercrime strictly separates the obligation to preserve data on 
request and the obligation to disclose them to the competent authorities.2172 Article 17 provides a clear 
classification,  as  it  combines  the  obligation  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  traffic  data  in  cases  where  a 
number of service providers were involved with the obligation to disclose the necessary information to 
identify the transmission path. Without such partial disclosure, law-enforcement agencies would in some 
cases  not  be  able  to  trace  back  the  offender  if  more  than  one  provider  was  involved.2173 Due  to  the 
combination of the two obligations, which affect the rights of suspects in different ways, it is necessary to 
discuss the focus of the safeguards related to this instrument.

The provision 
 
Production of data 
15  If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of an application by a police officer that specified computer 
data, or a printout or other information, is reasonably required for the purpose of a criminal investigation 
or criminal proceedings, the magistrate may order that: 
 

(a) a person in the territory of [enacting country] in control of a computer system produce from the 
system specified computer data or a printout or other intelligible output of that data; and 
(b)  an  Internet  service  provider  in  [enacting  country]  produce  information  about  persons  who 
subscribe to or otherwise use the service; and 
(c)2175 a person in the territory of [enacting country] who has access to a specified computer system 
process and compile specified computer data from the system and give it to a specified person. 

 

 

Disclosure of stored traffic data 
16.2176 If a police officer is satisfied that data stored in a computer system is reasonably required for the 
purposes of a criminal investigation, the police officer may, by written notice given to a person in control 
of  the  computer  system,  require  the  person  to  disclose  sufficient  traffic  data  about  a  specified 
communication to identify: 
 
 
Preservation of data 
17. (1) If a police officer is satisfied that: 
 

(a) the service providers; and  
(b) the path through which the communication was transmitted. 

(a)  data  stored  in  a  computer  system  is  reasonably  required  for  the  purposes  of  a  criminal 
investigation; and 
(b) there is a risk that the data may be destroyed or rendered inaccessible; 

 
the police officer may, by written notice given to a person in control of the computer system, require the 
person to ensure that the data specified in the notice be preserved for a period of up to 7 days as specified 
in the notice. 
(2)  The  period  may  be  extended  beyond  7  days  if,  on  an  ex  parte  application,  a  [judge]  [magistrate] 
authorizes an extension for a further specified period of time. 

Data retention 

6.5.5 
A data-retention obligation forces the provider of Internet services to save traffic data for a certain period 
of  time.2177 The  implementation  of  a  data  retention  obligation  is  an  approach  to  avoid  the  above-
mentioned difficulties of gaining access to traffic data before they are deleted. An example for such an 
approach is the European Union Directive on Data Retention.2178  
 
Article 3 – Obligation to retain data 
1.  By  way  of  derogation  from  Articles  5,  6  and  9  of  Directive  2002/58/EC,  Member  States  shall  adopt 
measures to ensure that the data specified in Article 5 of this Directive are retained in accordance with the 
provisions  thereof,  to  the  extent  that  those  data  are  generated  or  processed  by  providers  of  publicly 
available  electronic  communications  services  or  of  a  public  communications  network  within  their 
jurisdiction in the process of supplying the communications services concerned.  
2.  The  obligation  to  retain  data  provided  for  in  paragraph  1  shall  include  the  retention  of  the  data 
specified in Article 5 relating to unsuccessful call attempts where those data are generated or processed, 
and  stored  (as  regards  telephony  data)  or  logged  (as  regards  Internet  data),  by  providers  of  publicly 
available electronic communications services or of a public communications network within the jurisdiction 
of the Member State concerned in the process of supplying the communication services concerned. This 
Directive shall not require data relating to unconnected calls to be retained.  

 

249 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Article 4 – Access to data  
Member States shall adopt measures to ensure that data retained in accordance with this Directive are 
provided only to the competent national authorities in specific cases and in accordance with national law. 
The procedures to be followed and the conditions to be fulfilled in order to gain access to retained data in 
accordance with necessity and proportionality requirements shall be defined by each Member State in its 
national law, subject to the relevant provisions of European Union law or public international law, and in 
particular the ECHR as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights. 
Article 5 – Categories of data to be retained  
1. Member States shall ensure that the following categories of data are retained under this Directive:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(i) the user ID(s) allocated;  
(ii) the user ID and telephone number allocated to any communication entering the public

Article 7 – Data protection and data security  
Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  adopted  pursuant  to  Directive  95/46/EC  and  Directive  2002/58/EC, 
each Member State shall ensure that providers of publicly available electronic communications services or 
of a public communications network respect, as a minimum, the following data security principles with 
respect to data retained in accordance with this Directive:  
 

(a) the retained data shall be of the same quality and subject to the same security and protection as 
those data on the network;  
(b) the data shall be subject to appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the 
data  against  accidental  or  unlawful  destruction,  accidental  loss  or  alteration,  or  unauthorised  or 
unlawful storage, processing, access or disclosure;  
(c) the data shall be subject to appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that 
they can be accessed by specially authorised personnel only; and  
(d) the data, except those that have been accessed and preserved, shall be destroyed at the end of 
the period of retention.  

Article 8 – Storage requirements for retained data  
Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  data  specified  in  Article  5  are  retained  in  accordance  with  this 
Directive in such a way that the data retained and any other necessary information relating to such data 
can be transmitted upon request to the competent authorities without undue delay.  
 
The fact that key information about any communication on the Internet will be covered by the Directive 
has prompted intense criticism from human rights organizations.2179 This could in turn lead to a review of 
the Directive and its implementation by constitutional courts.2180 In addition, in her conclusion in the case 
Productores de Música de España (Promusicae) v. Telefónica de España,2181 the adviser to the European 
Court of Justice, Advocate General Juliane Kokott, pointed out that it is questionable whether the data-
retention  obligation  can  be  implemented  without  a  violation  of  fundamental  rights.2182 Difficulties  with 
regard to the implementation of such regulations were already pointed out by the G8 in 2001.2183  
But the criticism is not limited to this aspect. Another reason why data retention has turned out to be less 
effective in the fight against cybercrime is the fact that the obligations can be circumvented. The easiest 
ways to circumvent the data retention obligation include the use of different public Internet terminals or 
prepaid  mobile  phone  data  services  that  do  not  require  registration2184 and  the  use  of  anonymous 
communication  services  that  are  (at  least  partially)  operated  in  countries  where  the  data-retention 
obligation is not applied.2185 
If offenders use different public terminals or prepaid mobile phone data services where they do not need 
to  register  the  data  stored  by  the  providers,  the  data-retention  obligation  will  only  lead  the  law-
enforcement agencies to the service provider but not to the actual offender.2186  
Offenders can in addition circumvent the data-retention obligation by using anonymous communication 
servers.2187 In this case, law-enforcement agencies might be able to prove the fact that the offender used 
an  anonymous  communication  server,  but,  having  no  access  to  traffic  data  in  the  country  where  the 
anonymous  communication  server  is  located,  they  will  not  be  able  to  prove  the  participation  of  the 
offender in the perpetration of a criminal offence.2188  

 

251 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Given that it is very easy to circumvent the provision, the implementation of the data-retention legislation 
in the European Union is coupled with the fear that the process will require side-measures necessary to 
ensure the effectiveness of the instrument. Possible side-measures could include the obligation to register 
prior to the use of online services2189 or a ban on the use of anonymous communication technology.2190  

Search and seizure  

6.5.6 
Although new investigation instruments like real-time collection of content data and the use of remote 
forensic  software  to  identify  an  offender  are  under  discussion  and  already  implemented  by  some 
countries, search and seizure remains one of the most important investigation instruments.2191 As soon as 
the offender is identified and law enforcement seizes his IT equipment, the computer forensic experts can 
analyse the equipment to collect the evidence necessary for the prosecution.2192  
The possibility of replacing or amending the search and seizure procedure is currently being discussed in 
some European countries and in the United States.2193 One way to avoid the need to enter the suspect’s 
house to search and seize computer equipment would be to perform an online search. This instrument, 
which will be described more in detail in sections below, describes a procedure where law-enforcement 
agencies access the suspect’s computer via the Internet to perform secret search procedures.2194 Although 
law-enforcement agencies could clearly benefit from the fact that the suspect does not realize that the 
investigation  is  being  carried  out,  physical  access  to  the  hardware  enables  more  efficient  investigation 
techniques.2195 This  underlines  the  important  role  of  search  and  seizure  procedures  within  Internet 
investigation.  

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
Most  national  criminal  procedural  laws  contain  provisions  that  enable  law-enforcement  agencies  to 
search  and  seize  objects.2196 The  reason  why  the  drafters  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime nevertheless included a provision dealing with search and seizure is that national laws often 
do  not  cover  data-related  search  and  seizure  procedures.2197 Some  countries,  for  example,  limit  the 
application  of  seizure  procedures  to  seizing  physical  objects.2198 Based  on  such  provisions,  investigators 
are able to seize an entire server but not seize only the relevant data by copying them from the server. 
This can cause difficulties in cases where the relevant information is stored on a server together with the 
data of hundreds of other users, which would no longer be available after the law-enforcement agencies 
have seized that server. Another example where traditional search and seizure of tangible items is not 
sufficient is the case where the law-enforcement agencies do not know the physical location of the server 
but are able to access it via the Internet.2199 Article 19, like other procedural instruments provided by the 
Convention on Cybercrime, does not specify the conditions and requirements that must be fulfilled for 
investigators  to  carry  out  such  investigations.  The  provision  itself  neither  states  that  a  court  order  is 
necessary nor defines under what circumstances an exception to the requirement of a court order can be 
made. Taking into account the intrusion into the suspect’s civil liberties and rights that search and seizure 
procedures2200 entail, most countries limit the applicability of the instrument.2201  
Article 19 paragraph 1 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime aims to establish an instrument 
that enables the search of computer systems which is as efficient as traditional search procedures.2202  
 
Article 19 – Search and seizure of stored computer data  
1.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its 
competent authorities to search or similarly access:  
 
 
[…] 
 
Although the search and seizure procedure is an instrument that is frequently used by investigators, there 
are  a  number  of  challenges  that  accompany  its  application  in  cybercrime  investigations.2203 One  of  the 
main difficulties is that search orders are often limited to certain places (e.g. the home of the suspect).2204 

a. a computer system or part of it and computer data stored therein; and 
b. a computer-data storage medium in which computer data may be stored in its territory. 

252 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
With regard to the search for computer data it can turn out during the investigation that the suspect did 
not store them on local hard drives but on an external server that was accessed via the Internet.2205 Using 
Internet servers to store data and process data is becoming increasingly popular amongst Internet users 
(“cloud  computing”).  One  of  the  advantages  of  storing  information  on  an  Internet  server  is  that  the 
information can be accessed from any place with an Internet connection. To ensure that investigations 
can  be  carried  out  efficiently,  it  is  important  to  maintain  a  certain  flexibility  in  investigations.  If  the 
investigators  discover that relevant information is stored on another computer system, they should be 
able to extend the search to that system.2206 The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime addresses 
this issue in Article 19 paragraph 2.  
 
Article 19 – Search and seizure of stored computer data  
[…] 
2. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to ensure that where its 
authorities search or similarly access a specific computer system or part of it, pursuant to paragraph 1.a, 
and have grounds to believe that the data sought is stored in another computer system or part of it in its 
territory, and such data is lawfully accessible from or available to the initial system, the authorities shall be 
able to expeditiously extend the search or similar accessing to the other system. 
[…] 
 
Another challenge is related to the seizure of computer data. If the investigators come to the conclusion 
that the seizure of the hardware that is used to store the information is not necessary or would not be 
adequate,  they  may  still  need  other  instruments  that  enable  them  to  continue  the  search  and  seizure 
procedure with regard to the stored computer data.2207 The necessary instruments are not limited to the 
act of copying the relevant data.2208 In addition, there are a number of side-measures that are necessary 
to maintain required efficiency, such as the seizure of the computer system itself. The most important 
aspect is maintaining the integrity of the copied data.2209 If the investigators do not have permission to 
take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  copied  data,  the  copied  data  may  not  be 
accepted as evidence in criminal proceedings.2210 After the investigators have copied the data and taken 
measures  to  maintain  its  integrity,  they  will  need  to  decide  how  to  treat  the  original  data.  Since 
investigators will not remove the hardware during the seizure process, the information would in general 
remain  there.  Especially  in  investigations  related  to  illegal  content2211 (e.g. child  pornography),  the 
investigators will not be able to leave the data on the server. Therefore, they need an instrument that 
allows them to remove the data or at least ensure that the data can no longer be accessed.2212 The Council 
of Europe Convention on Cybercrime addresses the above mentioned issues in Article 19 paragraph 3.  
 
Article 19 – Search and seizure of stored computer data  
[…] 
3.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its 
competent authorities to seize or similarly secure computer data accessed according to paragraphs 1 or 2. 
These measures shall include the power to: 
 
 
 
 
[…] 
 
One more challenge regarding search orders pertaining to computer data is the fact that it is sometimes 
difficult for law-enforcement agencies to find the location of the data. Often they are stored in computer 
systems  outside  the  specific  national  territory.  Even  when  the  exact  location  is  known,  the  amount  of 
stored data often hinders expedited investigations.2213 In these cases, the investigations present unique 
difficulties, insofar as they have an international dimension that requires international cooperation within 
the investigations.2214 Even when the investigations are related to computer systems located within the 

a. seize or similarly secure a computer system or part of it or a computer-data storage medium; 
b. make and retain a copy of those computer data;  
c. maintain the integrity of the relevant stored computer data; 
d. render inaccessible or remove those computer data in the accessed computer system. 

 

253 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
national  borders,  and  the  investigators  have  identified  the  hosting  provider  that  operates  the  servers 
where the offender has stored the relevant data, the investigators might face difficulties in identifying the 
exact  location  of  the  data.  It  is  very  likely  that  even  small  and  medium-sized  hosting  providers  have 
hundreds of servers and thousands of hard disks. Very often the investigators will not be able to identify 
the exact location with the help of the system administrator responsible for the server infrastructure.2215 
But  even  when  they  are  able  to  identify  the  specific  hard  drive,  protection  measures  might  stop  them 
from searching for the relevant data. The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime decided to address 
this  issue  by  implementing  a  coercive  measure  to  facilitate  the  search  and  seizure  of  computer  data. 
Article 19  paragraph  4  enables  the  investigators  to  compel  a  system  administrator  to  assist  law-
enforcement  agencies.  Although  the  obligation  to  follow  the  orders  of  the  investigator  is  limited  to 
necessary information and support for the case, this instrument changes the nature of search and seizure 
procedures.  In  many  countries,  search  and  seizure  orders  only  force  the  people  affected  by  the 
investigation to tolerate the proceedings – they do not need to actively support the investigation. With 
regard to a person who has special knowledge that is needed by the investigators, implementation of the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime will change the situation in two ways. First of all they will 
need  to  provide  the  necessary  information  to  the  investigators.  The  second  change  is  related  to  this 
obligation. The obligation to provide – reasonable – support to the investigators will relieve the person 
with special knowledge from contractual obligations or orders given by supervisors.2216 The Convention on 
Cybercrime does not define the term “reasonable”, but the Explanatory Report points out that reasonable 
“may include disclosing a password or other security measure to the investigating authorities” but does in 
general not cover “the disclosure of the password or other security measure” where this would go along 
with  “unreasonably  threaten  the  privacy  of  other  users  or  other  data  that  is  not  authorised  to  be 
searched”.2217

system  or  measures  applied  to  protect  the  computer  data  therein  to  provide,  as  is  reasonable,  the 
necessary information, to enable the undertaking of the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.

Production order 

6.5.7 
Even  if  an  obligation  like  the  one  in  Article 19  paragraph  4  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime  is  not  implemented  in  national  law,  providers  will  often  cooperate  with  law-enforcement 
agencies to avoid a negative impact on their business. If – due to a lack of cooperation of the provider – 
investigators are unable to find the data or the storage devices they need to search and seize, it is likely 
that the investigators will need to seize more hardware than actually necessary. Therefore, providers will 
in  general  support  investigations  and  provide  the  relevant  data  on  request  of  the  law-enforcement 
agencies. The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime contains instruments that allow investigators 
to  do  without  search  orders  if  the  person  who  is  in  possession  of  relevant  data  submits  them  to  the 
investigators.2221  
Although the joint efforts of law-enforcement agencies and service providers even in cases where there is 
no  legal  basis  seem  to  be  a  positive  example  of  public-private  partnership,  there  are  a  number  of 
difficulties with unregulated cooperation. In addition to data-protection issues, the main concern is that 
service providers could violate their contractual obligations with their customers if they follow a request 
to submit certain data that is not founded on a sufficient legal basis.2222  
 
Article 18 – Production order  
1.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its 
competent authorities to order: 
 

a. a person in its territory to submit specified computer data in that person’s possession or control, 
which is stored in a computer system or a computer-data storage medium; and 
b.  a  service  provider  offering  its  services  in  the  territory  of  the  Party  to  submit  subscriber 
information relating to such services in that service provider’s possession or control. 

 

 
Article 18  contains  two  obligations.  Based  on  Article 18  paragraph 1.a,  any  person  (including  service 
provider)  is  obliged  to  submit  specified  computer  data  that  are  in  the  person’s  possession  or  control. 
Unlike  Subparagraph 1b),  the  application  of  the  provision  is  not  limited  to  specific  data.  The  term 
“possession”  requires  that  the  person  have  physical  access  to  the  data  storage  devices  where  the 
specified  information  is  stored.2223 The  application  of  the  provision  is  extended  by  the  term  “control”. 
Data are under control of a person if he/she has no physical access but is managing the information. This 
is, for example, the case if the suspect has stored relevant data on a remote online storage system. In the 
Explanatory Report, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime nevertheless point out that the mere 
technical ability to remotely access stored data does not necessary constitute control.2224 The application 
of Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is therefore limited to cases where the 
degree of control of the suspect goes beyond the potential possibility to access the data. 
Subparagraph  1b)  contains  a  production  order  that  is  limited  to  certain  data.  Based  on  Article 18 
Subparagraph 1b), investigators can order a service provider to submit subscriber information. Subscriber 

 

255 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
information  can  be  necessary  to  identify  an  offender.  If  the  investigators  are  able  to  discover  the  IP 
address that was used by the offender, they need to link this number to a person.2225 In most cases, the IP 
address only leads to the Internet provider that provided the IP address to the user. Before enabling the 
use of a service, Internet providers generally require a user to register with his subscriber information.2226 
Article 18 paragraph 1.b permits investigators to order the provider to submit this subscriber information. 
In  this  context,  it  is  important  to  highlight  that  Article 18  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime does not, however, impose either a data-retention obligation2227 or an obligation for service 
providers to register subscriber information.2228  
The  differentiation  between  “computer  data”  in  Subparagraph  1a)  and  “subscriber  information”  in 
Subparagraph 1b) seems at first sight not to be necessary, insofar as subscriber information that is stored 
in digital form is also covered by Subparagraph 1a). The first reason for the differentiation stems from the 
different definitions of “computer data” and “subscriber information”. Unlike “computer data”, the term 
“subscriber  information”  does  not  require  that  the  information  be  stored  as  computer  data.  Article 18 
Subparagraph 1b)  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  enables  the  competent  law 
authorities to submit information that is kept in non-digital form.2229  
 
Article 1 – Definitions  
For the purposes of this Convention:  
[…] 
b.  “computer  data”  means  any  representation  of  facts,  information  or  concepts  in  a  form  suitable  for 
processing in a computer system, including a program suitable to cause a computer system to perform a 
function;  

 
Article 18 – Production order 
[…] 
3. For the purpose of this article, the term “subscriber information” means any information contained in 
the form of computer data or any other form that is held by a service provider, relating to subscribers of its 
services other than traffic or content data and by which can be established:  
 

a. the type of communication service used, the technical provisions taken thereto and the period of 
service;  
b.  the  subscriber’s  identity,  postal  or  geographic  address,  telephone  and  other  access  number, 
billing and payment information, available on the basis of the service agreement or arrangement;  
c. any other information on the site of the installation of communication equipment, available on 
the basis of the service agreement or arrangement.  

 

 

 
The second reason for the distinction between “computer data” and “subscriber information” is that it 
enables  law-makers  to  implement  different  requirements  with  regard  to  the  application  of  the 
instruments.2230 It is for example possible to impose stricter requirements2231 for a production order under 
Subparagraph 1b),  as  this  instrument  allows  law-enforcement  agencies  to  get  access  to  any  kind  of 
computer data, including content data.2232 The differentiation between the real-time collection of traffic 
data (Article 20)2233 and the real-time collection of content data (Article 21)2234 shows that the drafters of 
the Convention on Cybercrime realized that, depending on the kind of data law-enforcement agencies get 
access to, different safeguards need to be implemented.2235 With the differentiation between “computer 
data” and “subscriber information”, Article 18 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime enables 
the  signatory  states  to  develop  a  similar  system  of  graded  safeguards  with  regard  to  the  production 
order.2236

system specified computer data or a printout or other intelligible output of that data; and 
(b)  an  Internet  service  provider  in  [enacting  country]  produce  information  about  persons  who

Real-time collection of data 

6.5.8 
Telephone surveillance is an instrument that is used in capital crime investigations in many countries.2239 
Many offences involve the use of a phone – especially mobile phones – either in the preparation or the 
execution  of  the  offence.  Especially  in  cases  involving  drug  trafficking,  surveillance  of  conversations 
between  perpetrators  can  be  essential  for  the  success  of  the  investigation.  The  instrument  allows 
investigators  to  collect  valuable  information,  although  it  is  limited  to  information  exchanged  over  the 
observed lines/phones. If the offender uses other means of exchange (e.g. letters) or lines that are not 
included in the observation, the investigators will not be able to record the conversation. In general, the 
situation is the same when it comes to direct conversation without the use of phones.2240  
Today, the exchange of data has replaced conventional phone conversations. The exchange of data is not 
limited  to  e-mails  and  file-transfers.  An  increasing  amount  of  voice  communication  is  performed  using 
technology based on Internet protocols (voice-over-IP).2241 Seen from a technical point of view, a voice-
over-IP phone call is much more comparable to the exchange of e-mails than to a conventional phone call 
using the telephone wire, and the interception of this type of call presents unique difficulties. 2242  
Since many computer crimes involve the exchange of data, the ability to also intercept these processes or 
otherwise use data related to the exchange process can become an essential requirement for successful 
investigations. The application of existing telephone surveillance provisions and provisions related to the 
use of telecommunication traffic data in cybercrime investigations has turned out to be difficult in some 
countries.  The  difficulties  encountered  are  related  to  technical  issues2243 as  well  as  legal  issues.  From  a 
legal  point  of  view,  authorization  to  record  a  telephone  conversation  does  not  necessarily  include 
authorization to intercept data-transfer processes.  
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  aims  to  close  existing  gaps  in  the  ability  of  law-
enforcement  agencies  to  monitor  data-transfer  processes.2244 Within  this  approach,  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime  distinguishes  between  two  subsets  of  data-transfer  observation.  Article 20  authorizes 
investigators to collect traffic data. The term “traffic data” is defined in Article 1.d of the Convention.  
 
Article 1 – Definitions 
[…] 
d. “traffic data” means any computer data relating to a communication by means of a computer system, 
generated  by  a  computer  system  that  formed  a  part  in  the  chain  of  communication,  indicating  the 
communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service.  
 
The distinction between “content data” and “traffic data” is the same as the differentiation used in most 
related national laws.2245

Collection of traffic data 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
Bearing in mind that the definition of traffic data varies from country to country,2246 the drafters of the 
Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  decided  to  define  this  term  in  order  to  improve  the 
application  of  the  related  provision  in  international  investigations.  The  term  “traffic  data”  is  used  to 
describe  data  that  are  generated  by  computers  during  the  communication  process  in  order  to  route  a 
communication from its origin to its destination. Whenever a user connects to the Internet, downloads 
e-mails  or  opens  a  website,  traffic  data  is  generated.  For  cybercrime  investigations,  the  most  relevant 
origin and destination traffic data are IP addresses that identify the communication partners in Internet-
related communication.2247  
Unlike “content data”, the term “traffic data” covers only data produced within data-transfer processes, 
but not the transferred data themselves. Although access to the content data might be necessary in some 
cases as it enables law-enforcement agencies to analyse the communication much more effectively, traffic 
data  plays  an  important  role  in  cybercrime  investigation.2248 While  access  to  content  data  enables  law-
enforcement  agencies  to  analyse  the  nature  of  the  messages  or  files  exchanged,  traffic  data  can  be 
necessary  to  identify  an  offender.  In  child-pornography  cases,  traffic  data  can  for  example  enable  the 
investigators  to  identify  a  webpage where  the  offender  is  uploading  child-pornography  images.  By 
monitoring the traffic data generated during the use of Internet services, law-enforcement agencies are 
able to identify the IP address of the server and can then try to determine its physical location.  
 
Article 20 – Real-time collection of traffic data 
1.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  empower  its 
competent authorities to: 
 
 
 
 

a. collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party, and  
b. compel a service provider, within its existing technical capability: 

i. to collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party; or 
ii.  to  co-operate  and  assist  the  competent  authorities  in  the  collection  or  recording  of,  traffic 
data,  in  real-time,  associated  with  specified  communications  in  its  territory  transmitted  by 
means of a computer system. 

2.  Where  a  Party,  due  to  the  established  principles  of  its  domestic  legal  system,  cannot  adopt  the 
measures referred to in paragraph 1.a, it may instead adopt legislative and other measures as may be 
necessary  to  ensure  the  real-time  collection  or  recording  of  traffic  data  associated  with  specified 
communications transmitted in its territory, through the application of technical means on that territory. 
3.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  oblige  a  service 
provider to keep confidential the fact of the execution of any power provided for in this article and any 
information relating to it. 
4. The powers and procedures referred to in this article shall be subject to Articles 14 and 15. 
 
Article 20 contains two different approaches for the collection of traffic data, both of which are supposed 
to be implemented.2249  
The  first  approach  is  to  impose  an  obligation  on  Internet  service  providers  to  enable  law-enforcement 
agencies to collect the relevant data directly. This generally requires the installation of an interface which 
law-enforcement agencies can use to access the Internet service provider’s infrastructure.2250  
The second approach is to enable law-enforcement agencies to compel an Internet service provider to 
collect  data  at  their  request.  This  approach  enables  investigators  to  make  use  of  existing  technical 
capacities  and  the  knowledge  the  providers  in  general  have  at  hand.  One  of  the  intentions  behind 
combining the two approaches is to ensure that if providers do not have the technology in place to record 
the  data,  law-enforcement  agencies  should  be  able  to  carry  out  the  investigation  (based  on  Article 20 
paragraph 1.b) without the assistance of the provider.2251  

258 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  is  neither  drafted  with  preference  to  a  specific 
technology nor intended to set standards that result in the need for high financial investments for the 
industry  involved.2252 From  that  perspective,  Article 20  paragraph 1.a  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime 
seems to be the better solution. However, the regulation in Article 20 paragraph 2 shows that the drafters 
of the Convention on Cybercrime were aware that some countries might have difficulties in implementing 
legislation that enables law-enforcement agencies to carry out the investigations directly.  
One  of  the  major  difficulties  in  investigations  based  on  Article 20  is  the  use  of  means  of  anonymous 
communication. As explained above,2253 offenders can use services in the Internet that enable anonymous 
communication. If the offender is using an anonymous communication service like the software Tor,2254 
investigators are in most cases unable to analyse the traffic data and identify the communication partners 
successfully. Offenders can achieve a similar result by using public Internet terminals.2255  
Compared to traditional search and seizure procedures, one of the advantages of the collection of traffic 
data is that the suspect of a crime does not necessary realize that an investigation is taking place.2256 This 
limits his/her possibilities to manipulate or delete evidence. To ensure that offenders are not informed by 
the  service  provider  about  the  ongoing  investigation,  Article 20  paragraph 3  addresses  this  issue  and 
obliges the signatory states to implement legislation that ensures that service providers keep knowledge 
of the ongoing investigation confidential. For the service provider, this is coupled with the advantage that 
the provider is relieved from the obligation2257 to inform the users.2258  
The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime was designed to improve and harmonize legislation with 
regard to cybercrime-related issues.2259 In this context, it is important to highlight that based on the text in 
Article 21 thereof, the provision does not only apply to cybercrime-related offences, but to any offence. 
Given  that  the  use  of  electronic  communication  can  be  relevant  not  only  in  cybercrime  cases,  the 
application  of  this  provision  outside  of  cybercrime  offences  can  be  useful  within  investigations.  This 
would, for example, enable law-enforcement agencies to use traffic data that are generated during the 
exchange of e-mails between offenders for the preparation of a traditional crime. Article 14 paragraph 3 
gives  the  parties  the  right  to  make  reservations  and  limit  the  application  of  the  provision  to  certain 
offences.2260  

Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law  
A similar approach can be found in the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.2261 
 
Interception of traffic data 
19.  (1)  If  a  police  officer  is  satisfied  that  traffic  data  associated  with  a  specified  communication  is 
reasonably required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, the police officer may, by written notice 
given to a person in control of such data, request that person to: 
 

(a)  collect  or  record  traffic  data  associated  with  a  specified  communication  during  a  specified 
period; and 
(b) permit and assist a specified police officer to collect or record that data. 

 
(2) If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of [information on oath] [affidavit] that there are reasonable 
grounds [to suspect] that traffic data is reasonably required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, 
the magistrate [may] [shall] authorize a police officer to collect or record traffic data associated with a 
specified communication during a specified period through application of technical means. 

6.5.10 

Interception of content data 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
Apart  from  the  fact  that  Article 21  deals  with  content  data,  the  structure  is  similar  to  Article 20.  The 
possibility  to  intercept  data-exchange  processes  can  be  important  in  cases  where  law-enforcement 
agencies already know who the communication partners are but have no information about the type of 
information exchanged. Article 21 gives them the possibility to record data communication and analyse 

 

259 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
the  content.2262 This  includes  files  downloaded  from  websites  or  file-sharing  systems,  e-mails  sent  or 
received by the offender and chat conversations.  
 
Article 21 – Interception of content data  
1. Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary, in relation to a range 
of serious offences to be determined by domestic law, to empower its competent authorities to: 
 
 
 
 
 

i. to collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party, or 
ii. to co-operate and assist the competent authorities in the collection or recording of, 
content data, in real-time, of specified communications in its territory transmitted by means of a 
computer system. 

a. collect or record through the application of technical means on the territory of that Party, and  
b. compel a service provider, within its existing technical capability: 

2.  Where  a  Party,  due  to  the  established  principles  of  its  domestic  legal  system,  cannot  adopt  the 
measures referred to in paragraph 1.a, it may instead adopt legislative and other measures as may be 
necessary to ensure the real-time collection or recording of content data on specified communications in 
its territory through the application of technical means on that territory. 
3.  Each  Party  shall  adopt  such  legislative  and  other  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  oblige  a  service 
provider to keep confidential the fact of the execution of any power provided for in this article and any 
information relating to it. 
4. The powers and procedures referred to in this article shall be subject to Articles 14 and 15. 
 
Unlike  in  the case  of  traffic  data,  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  provide  a 
definition  of  content  data.  As  is  implicit  in  the  term  itself,  “content  data”  refers  to  the  content  of  the 
communication. 
Examples of content data in cybercrime investigations include:  

• 
• 
• 

the subject of an e-mail;  
content on a website opened by the suspect; 
the content of a VoIP conversation.  

One  of  the  most  important  difficulties  for  investigations  based  on  Article 21  is  the  use  of  encryption 
technology.2263 As explained in detail previously, the use of encryption technology can enable offenders to 
protect the content exchanged in a way that makes it impossible for law-enforcement agencies to gain 
access to it. If the offender encrypts the content he/she transfers, law-enforcement agencies are only able 
to intercept the encrypted communication but not analyse the content. Without access to the key that 
was used to encrypt the files, any possible decryption could take a very long time.2264 

Commonwealth Computer and Computer-related Crimes Model Law  
A similar approach can be found in the 2002 Commonwealth Model Law.2265 
 
Interception of electronic communications 
18. (1) If a [magistrate] [judge] is satisfied on the basis of [information on oath] [affidavit] that there are 
reasonable grounds [to suspect][to believe] that the content of electronic communications is reasonably 
required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, the magistrate [may] [shall]: 
 

(a)  order  an  Internet  service  provider  whose  service  is  available  in  [enacting  country]  through 
application of technical means to collect or record or to permit or assist competent authorities with 
the collection or recording of content data associated with specified communications transmitted by 
means of a computer system; or  
(b) authorize a police officer to collect or record that data through application of technical means.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
6.5.11  Regulation regarding encryption technology 
As  described  above,  offenders  can  also  hinder  content-data  analysis  by  using  encryption  technology. 
Various  software  products  are  available  that  enable  users  to  effectively  protect  files  as  well  as  data-
transfer  processes  against  unauthorized  access.2266 If  suspects  have  used  such  a  product  and  the 
investigation authorities do not have access to the key that was used to encrypt the files, the required 
decryption could take a long time.2267  
The use of encryption technology by offenders is a challenge for law-enforcement agencies.2268 There are 
various national and international approaches2269 to address the problem.2270 Owing to differing estimates 
of  the  threat  of  encryption  technology,  there  is  as  yet  no  widely  accepted  international  approach  to 
address the topic.  
One approach is to authorize law-enforcement agencies to break encryption if necessary.2271 Without such 
authorization, or the possibility of issuing a production order, investigation authorities could be unable to 
collect  the  necessary  evidence.  In  addition,  or  as  an  option,  investigators  can  be  authorized  to  use 
keylogger software to intercept a passphrase to an encrypted file in order to break an encryption.2272  
Another  approach  is  to  limit  the  performance  of  encryption  software  by  restricting  key  length.2273 
Depending  on  the  degree  of  the  limitation,  this  would  enable  investigators  to  break  keys  within  a 
reasonable period of time. Opponents of such a solution fear that the limitations would not only enable 
investigators to break encryption, but also economic spies trying to obtain access to encrypted business 
information.2274 In addition, the restriction would only stop offenders using a stronger encryption if such 
software tools are available. This would first of all require international standards to prevent producers of 
strong encryption products from offering their software in countries without proper restrictions on key 
length. In any event, offenders could relatively easily develop their own encryption software with no limit 
on key length.  
The obligation to establish a key escrow system or key recovery procedure for strong encryption products 
is  another  approach.2275 Implementing  such  regulations  would  enable  users  to  continue  to  use  strong 
encryption technology but enable investigators to gain access to the relevant data by forcing the user to 
submit the key to a special authority which holds the key and provides it to investigators if necessary.2276 
Opponents of such a solution fear that people could obtain access to the submitted keys and with them 
decrypt  secret  information.  In  addition,  offenders  could  relatively  easily  circumvent  the  regulation  by 
developing  their  own  encryption  software  that  does  not  require  the  submission  of  the  key  to  the 
authority. 
Lastly, countries try to address the challenge by implementing a production order.2277 This term describes 
the  obligation  to  disclose  a  key  used  to  encrypt  data.  The  implementation  of  such  an  instrument  was 
discussed  within  the  1997  G8  Meeting  in  Denver.2278 A  number  of  countries  have  implemented  such 
obligations.2279 An example of national implementation is section 69 of India’s Information Technology Act 
2000.2280 Another  example  of  such  an  obligation  is  section 49  of  the  United  Kingdom  Regulation  of 
Investigatory Powers Act 2000:2281  
 
Notices requiring disclosure 
49.(1) This section applies where any protected information - 
 

(a) has come into the possession of any person by means of the exercise of a statutory power to 
seize, detain, inspect, search or otherwise to interfere with documents or other property, or is likely 
to do so;  
(b) has come into the possession of any person by means of the exercise of any statutory power to 
intercept communications, or is likely to do so;  
(c) has come into the possession of any person by means of the exercise of any power conferred by 
an authorisation under section 22(3) or under Part II, or as a result of the giving of a notice under 
section 22(4), or is likely to do so;  

 

 

 

261 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

(d) has come into the possession of any person as a result of having been provided or disclosed in 
pursuance  of  any  statutory  duty  (whether  or  not  one  arising  as  a  result  of  a  request  for 
information), or is likely to do so; or  
(e) has, by any other lawful means not involving  the exercise of statutory powers, come into the 
possession of any of the intelligence services, the police or the customs and excise, or is likely so to 
come into the possession of any of those services, the police or the customs and excise.  

(a) that a key to the protected information is in the possession of any person,  
(b) that the imposition of a disclosure requirement in respect of the protected information is –  

(2) If any person with the appropriate permission under Schedule 2 believes, on reasonable grounds-  
 
 
 
 

(i) necessary on grounds falling within subsection (3), or  
(ii) necessary for the purpose of securing the effective exercise or proper performance by any 
public authority of any statutory power or statutory duty,  

(c) that the imposition of such a requirement is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by 
its imposition, and  
(d) that it is not reasonably practicable for the person with the appropriate permission to obtain 
possession of the protected information in an intelligible form without the giving of a notice under 
this section,  

 
 

 
 

 
 

(a) in the interests of national security;  
(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime; or  
(c) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.  

the person with that permission may, by notice to the person whom he believes to have possession of the 
key, impose a disclosure requirement in respect of the protected information.  
(3) A disclosure requirement in respect of any protected information is necessary on grounds falling within 
this subsection if it is necessary-  
 
 
 
(4) A notice under this section imposing a disclosure requirement in respect of any protected information-  
(a) must be given in writing or (if not in writing) must be given in a manner that produces a record 
 
of its having been given;  
(b) must describe the protected information to which the notice relates;  
(c) must specify the matters falling within subsection (2)(b)(i) or (ii) by reference to which the notice 
is given;  
(d) must specify the office, rank or position held by the person giving it;  
(e)  must  specify  the  office,  rank  or  position  of  the  person  who  for  the  purposes  of  Schedule  2 
granted permission for the giving of the notice or (if the person giving the notice was entitled to 
give  it  without  another  person’s  permission)  must  set  out  the  circumstances  in  which  that 
entitlement arose;  
(f) must specify the time by which the notice is to be complied with; and  
(g) must set out the disclosure that is required by the notice and the form and manner in which it is 
to be made;  

and  the  time  specified  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  (f)  must  allow  a  period  for  compliance  which  is 
reasonable in all the circumstances.  
 
To ensure that the person obliged to disclose the key follows the order and actually submits the key, the 
United Kingdom Investigatory Powers Act 2000 contains a provision that criminalized failure to comply 
with the order.  
 
Failure to comply with a notice. 
53(1) A person to whom a section 49 notice has been given is guilty of an offence if he knowingly fails, in 
accordance with the notice, to make the disclosure required by virtue of the giving of the notice.  
(2) In proceedings against any person for an offence under this section, if it is shown that that person was 
in possession of a key to any protected information at any time before the time of the giving of the section 
49 notice, that person shall be taken for the purposes  of those proceedings to have continued to be in 
possession of that key at all subsequent times, unless it is shown that the key was not in his possession 
after the giving of the notice and before the time by which he was required to disclose it.

a key to protected information at a particular time if-  
 
 
(4) In proceedings against any person for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for that person 
to show  
 

(a) sufficient evidence of that fact is adduced to raise an issue with respect to it; and

(b) that he did make that disclosure as soon after that time as it was reasonably practicable for him 
to do so.  

 

(5) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable-  
 

(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine, or 
to both; 
(b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not 
exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both. 

 

[…] 
 
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 obliges the suspect of a crime to support the work of 
law-enforcement agencies.2282  
A general concern to this regulation is that the obligation leads to potential conflict with the fundamental 
rights  of  a  suspect  against  self-incrimination.2283 Instead  of  leaving  the  investigation  to  the  competent 
authorities,  the  suspect  has  to  actively  support  the  investigation.  The  strong  protection  against  self-
incrimination in many countries thus raises the question of how far such regulation has the potential to 
become a model solution to address the challenge posed by encryption technology.2284  
Another concern is that losing the key could lead to a criminal investigation. Although the criminalization 
requires that the offender knowingly refuses to disclose the key, losing the key could involve people using 
encryption  keys  in  unwanted  criminal  proceedings.  In  particular,  however,  section 53(2)  potentially 
interferes with the burden of proof.2285 
Finally, there are technical solutions that enable offenders to circumvent the obligation to disclose the key 
used  to  encrypt  data.  One  example  of  how  the  offender  can  circumvent  the  obligation  is  the  use  of 
encryption software based on the “plausible deniability2286” principle.2287  

6.5.12  Remote forensic software 
As explained above, the search for evidence on the suspect’s computer requires physical access to the 
relevant hardware (computer system and external storage media). This procedure in general implies the 
need to access the apartment, house or office of the suspect. In this case, the suspect will be aware of an 
ongoing investigation as soon as the investigators start carrying out the search.2288 This information could 
lead to a change in behaviour. 2289 If the offender, for example, attacked some computer systems to test 
his capabilities in order to participate in the preparation of a much larger series of attacks together with 
other offenders at a future date, the search procedure could hinder the investigators from identifying the 
other suspects as it is very likely the offender will stop communicating with them.  
To avoid the detection of ongoing investigations, law-enforcement agencies demand an instrument that 
allows them to access computer data stored on the suspect’s computers, and that can be secretly used 
like  telephone  surveillance  for  monitoring  telephone  calls.2290 Such  an  instrument  would  enable  law-
enforcement agencies to remotely access the suspect’s computer and search for information. Currently, 
the question whether or not such instruments are necessary is being intensively discussed.2291 Already in 
2001, reports pointed out that the United States FBI was developing a keylogger tool for Internet-related 
investigations  called  the  “magic  lantern”.2292 In  2007,  reports  were  published  that  law-enforcement 
agencies in the United States were using software to trace back suspects that use means of anonymous 

 

263 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
communication.2293 The reports were referring to a search warrant where the use of a tool called CIPAV2294 
was requested.2295 After the Federal Court in Germany decided that the existing Criminal Procedural Law 
provisions  do  not  allow  investigators  to  use  remote  forensic  software  to  secretly  search  the  suspect’s 
computer, a debate about the need to amend the existing laws in this area started.2296Within the debate, 
information was published that investigation authorities had unlawfully used remote forensic software in 
a couple of investigations.2297  
Various  concepts  of  “remote  forensic  software”  and  especially  its  possible  functions  have  been 
discussed.2298 Seen  from  a  theoretical  perspective  the  software  could  have  the  following  functions:  one 
function could be a search function. This function would enable law-enforcement agencies to search for 
illegal  content  and  collect  information  about  the  files  stored  on the  computer.2299 Another  possibility  is 
recording.  Investigators  could  record  data  that  are  processed  on  the  computer  system  of  the  suspect 
without  being  permanently  stored.  If,  for  example,  the  suspect  uses  voice-over-IP  services  to 
communicate with other suspects, the content of the conversation would in general not be stored.2300 The 
remote forensic software could record the processed data to preserve them for the investigators. If the 
remote forensic software contains a module to record key strokes, this module could be used to record 
passwords that the suspect uses to encrypt files.2301 Furthermore, such a tool could include identification 
functions that enable the investigators to prove the suspect’s participation in a criminal offence, even if 
he/she  used  anonymous  communication  services  that  make  it  difficult  for  investigators  to  identify  the 
offender  by  tracing  back  the  IP-address  used.2302 Finally,  remote  software  could  be  used  to  activate  a 
webcam or the microphone for room-observation purposes.2303  
Although the possible functions of the software seem to be very useful for investigators, it is important to 
point  out  that  there  are  a  number  of  legal  as  well  as  technical  difficulties  related  to  the  use  of  such 
software. Seen from a technical point of view, the following aspects need to be taken into consideration. 

Difficulties with regard to the installation process  
The software needs to be installed on the suspect’s computer system. The spread of malicious software 
proves  that  the  installation  of  software  on  the  computer  of  an  Internet  user  without  his  permission  is 
possible.  But  the  main  difference  between  a  virus  and  a  remote  forensic  software  is  the  fact  that  the 
remote forensic software needs to be installed on a specific computer system (the suspect’s computer) 
while  a  computer  virus  aims  to  infect  as  many  computers  as  possible  without  needing  to  focus  on  a 
specific computer system. There are a number of techniques by which the software can be transmitted to 
the suspect’s computer. For example: installation with physical access to the computer system; placing 
the software on a website for download; online access to the computer system by circumventing security 
measures;  and  hiding  the  software  in  the  data  stream  that  is  generated  during  Internet  activities,  to 
mention  just  a  few.2304 Due  to  protection  measures  such  as  virus  scanners  and  firewalls  that  most 
computers are equipped with, all remote installation methods present difficulties for investigators.2305  

Advantage of physical access 
A number of the analyses conducted (e.g. physical inspection of data processing media) require access to 
the hardware. In addition, remote forensic software would only enable investigators to analyse computer 
systems that are connected to the Internet.2306 Furthermore, working remotely, it is difficult to maintain 
the integrity of the suspect’s computer system.2307 With regard to these aspects, remote forensic software 
will in general not be able to replace physical examination of the suspect’s computer system.  
In  addition,  a  number  of  legal  aspects  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  before  implementing  a 
provision that enables investigators to install remote forensic software. The safeguards established in the 
criminal procedural codes as well as the constitutions of many countries limit the potential functions of 
such  software.  In  addition  to  the  national  aspects,  the  installation  of  remote  forensic  software  could 
violate the principle of national sovereignty.2308 If the software is installed on a notebook that is taken out 
of  the  country  after  the  installation  process,  the  software  might  enable  the  investigators  to  perform 
criminal  investigations  in  a  foreign  territory  without  the  necessary  permission  of  the  responsible 
authorities.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Example 
One approach can be found in the legislative text developed by the beneficiary states within the HIPCAR 
initiative.2309  
 
Forensic Software  
27.(1)  If  a  [judge]  [magistrate]  is  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  [information  on  oath/affidavit]  that  in  an 
investigation concerning an offence listed in paragraph 7 herein below there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that essential evidence can not be collected by applying other instruments listed in Part IV but is 
reasonably required for the purposes of a criminal investigation, the [judge] [magistrate] [may] [shall] on 
application authorize a police officer to utilize a remote forensic software with the specific task required 
for  the  investigation  and  install  it  on  the  suspect’s  computer  system  in  order  to  collect  the  relevant 
evidence. The application needs to contain the following information:  
 
 
 
 
(2) Within such investigation it is necessary to ensure that modifications to the computer system of the 
suspect are limited to those essential for the investigation and that any changes if possible can be undone 
after the end of the investigation. During the investigation it is necessary to log  
 
 

(a) suspect of the offence, if possible with name and address, and 
(b) description of the targeted computer system, and 
(c) description of the intended measure, extent and duration of the utilization, and 
(d) reasons for the necessity of the utilization. 

(a) the technical mean used and time and date of the application; and 
(b) the identification of the computer system and details of the modifications undertaken within the 
investigation;. 
(c) any information obtained. 

 
Information  obtained  by  the  use  of  such  software  need  to  be  protected  again  any  modification, 
unauthorized deletion and unauthorized access.  
(3)  The  duration  of  authorization  in  section  27  (1)  is  limited  to  [3  month].  If  the  conditions  of  the 
authorization is no longer met, the action taken are to stop immediately. 
(4) The authorization to install the software includes remotely accessing the suspects computer system.  
(5) If the installation process requires physical access to a place the requirements of section 20 need to be 
fulfilled.  
(6)  If  necessary  a  [law  enforcement]  [police]  officer  may  pursuant  to  the  order  of  court  granted  in  (1) 
above request that the court order an internet service provider to support the installation process.  
(7) [List of offences] 
(8) A country may decide not to implement section 27. 
 
The  drafters  of  the  legislative  text  pointed  out  that  they  are  aware  that  application  of  the  instrument 
could  be  very  intrusive  and  potentially  interfere  with  fundamental  rights  of  the  suspect.2310 Several 
safeguards  have  therefore  been  implemented.  Firstly,  the  use  of  such  software  requires  that  evidence 
cannot be collected by means of other processes. Secondly, an order by a judge or magistrate is required. 
Thirdly, the application needs to contain four key elements. In addition, the authorized acts are limited by 
both paragraphs 1 and 2.  

6.5.13  Authorization requirement 
Offenders  can  take  certain  measures  to  complicate  investigations.  In  addition  to  using  software  that 
enables  anonymous  communication,2311 identification  can  be  complicated  if  the  suspect  is  using  public 
Internet  terminals  or  open  wireless  networks.  Restrictions  on  the  production  of  software  enabling  the 
user to hide his/her identity and on making public Internet access terminals available that do not require 
identification  could  help  law-enforcement  agencies  to  conduct  investigations  more  efficiently.  An 
example of an approach to restrict the use of public terminals to commit criminal offences is Article 72312 
of Italian Decree 144,2313 which was converted into a law in 2005 (Legge No. 155/2005). 2314 This provision 
forces anybody who intends to offer public Internet access (e.g. Internet cafes or universities2315) to apply 
for  authorization.  In  addition,  the  person  in  question  is  obliged  to  request  identification  from  his/her 

 

265 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
customers prior to giving them access to use the service. Since a private person who sets up a wireless 
access point is in general not covered by this obligation, monitoring can quite easily be circumvented if 
offenders make use of unprotected private networks to hide their identity.2316  
It is questionable whether the extent of improvement in investigations justifies the restriction of access to 
the Internet and to anonymous communication services. Free access to the Internet is today recognized 
as an important aspect of the right of free access to information that is protected by the constitution in a 
number  of  countries.  Registration  obligation  can  interfere  with  the  right  to  operate  Internet  services 
without  authorization,  as  emphasized  by  the  2005  Joint  Declaration  of  the  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on 
Freedom  of  Opinion  and  Expression,  the  OSCE  Representative  on  Freedom  of  the  Media  and  the  OAS 
Special  Rapporteur  on  Freedom  of  Expression.2317 It  is  likely  that  the  requirement  for  identification  will 
affect the use of the Internet, insofar as users will then always have to fear that their Internet usage is 
monitored. Even when users know that their activities are legal, it can still influence their interaction and 
usage.2318 At  the  same  time,  offenders  who  want  to  prevent  identification  can  easily  circumvent  the 
identification  procedure.  They  can,  for  example,  use  prepaid  phonecards  bought  abroad  which  do  not 
require identification to access the Internet. 
Similar concerns arise with regard to legislation targeting anonymous communication services. There is an 
ongoing debate on whether similar instruments discussed with regard to encryption technology should be 
applied  to  anonymous  communication  technology  and  services.2319 Apart  from  the  conflict  between 
protecting  privacy  and  ensuring  the  ability  to  investigate  offences,  the  arguments  against  the 
practicability  of  the  various  legal  approaches  to  address  the  challenge  of  encryption  (especially  lack  of 
enforceability) apply equally to anonymous communication.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

Introduction 

 
6.6.1 
An  increasing  number  of  cybercrimes  have  an  international  dimension.2320 As  pointed  out  above,  one 
reason  behind  this  phenomenon  is  the  fact  that  there  is  very  little  need  for  physical  presence  of  the 
offender  at  the  place  where  a  service  is  offered.2321 Offenders  do  not  therefore  generally  need  to  be 
present  at  the  place  where  the  victim  is  located.  As  there  is  no  comprehensive  international  legal 
framework  and  no  supranational  body  able  to  investigate  such  offences,  transnational  crimes  require 
cooperation of authorities in the countries involved.2322 The mobility of offenders, the independence from 
presence  of  the  offender  and  the  impact  of  the  offence  make  it  necessary  for  law-enforcement  and 
judicial authorities to collaborate and assist the state that has assumed jurisdiction.2323 Due to differences 
in national law and limited instruments, international cooperation is considered to be one of the major 
challenges of a globalization of crime.2324 This is relevant for traditional forms of transnational crimes as 
well as cybercrime. One of the key demands of investigators in transnational investigations is immediate 
reaction of their counterparts in the country where the offender is located.2325 Especially when it comes to 
this issue, traditional instruments of international judicial cooperation in criminal law matters very often 
do not meet requirements in terms of the speed of investigations in the Internet.2326  

6.6.2  Mechanisms for international cooperation  
For cybercrime investigations, the most relevant formal mechanisms supporting international cooperation 
are mutual legal assistance and extradition. Other mechanisms such as transfer of prisoners, transfer of 
proceedings in criminal matters, confiscation of criminal proceeds and asset recovery are less important in 
practice. In addition to the formal mechanisms, there are informal ways of cooperation such as exchange 
of intelligence among law-enforcement agencies in different countries.  

6.6.3  Overview of applicable instruments 
There are three main scenarios when it comes to identifying the applicable instrument for international 
cooperation.  First,  relevant  procedures  can  be  part  of  international  agreements,  such  as  the  United 
Nations  Convention  against  Transnational  Organized  Crime  (UNTOC)2327 and  its  three  protocols,2328 or 
regional conventions, such as the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters,2329 
the  European  Convention  on  Mutual  Assistance  in  Criminal  Matters2330 and  the  Council  of  Europe 
Convention  on  Cybercrime.2331 The  second  possibility  is  for  procedures  to  be  regulated  by  bilateral 
agreements. Such agreements in general refer to specific requests that can be submitted and define the 
relevant  procedures  and  forms  of  contact  as  well  as  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  requesting  and 
requested  states.2332 Australia,  for  example,  has  signed  more  than  30  bilateral  agreements  with  other 
countries regulating aspects of extradition.2333 Some negotiations of such agreements have also addressed 
cybercrime  as  a  topic,  but  it  is  uncertain  to  what  extent  the  existing  agreements  adequately  govern 
cybercrime.2334 If neither a multilateral nor a bilateral agreement is applicable, international cooperation 
generally needs to be founded on international courtesy, based on reciprocity.2335 As cooperation based 
on bilateral agreements and courtesy very much depends on the circumstances of the actual case and the 
countries involved, the following overview focuses on international and regional conventions.  

6.6.4  United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
The  main  international  instrument  for  judicial  cooperation  in  criminal  matters  is  the  United  Nations 
Convention  against  Transnational  Organized  Crime  (UNTOC).2336 This  convention  contains  important 
instruments  for  international  cooperation,  but  was  not  specifically  designed  to  address  cybercrime-
related issues. Nor does it provide specific provisions dealing with urgent requests to preserve data.  

Application of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
Based  on  Article 3,  paragraph  1,  the  convention  is  only  applicable  in  cybercrime  cases  if  the  offence 
involves an organized crime group. Article 2 of UNTOC defines an organized crime group as a structured 
group of three or more people. 
 

 

267 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
Article 2. Use of terms 
For the purposes of this Convention: 
 

(a) “Organized criminal group” shall mean a structured group of three or more persons, existing for 
a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes or 
offences established in accordance with this Convention, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a 
financial or other material benefit; 

[...] 
 
Article 3. Scope of application 
1.  This  Convention  shall  apply,  except  as  otherwise  stated  herein,  to  the  prevention,  investigation  and 
prosecution of: 
 
 

(a) The offences established in accordance with articles 5, 6, 8 and 23 of this Convention; and 
(b) Serious crime as defined in article 2 of this Convention; where the offence is transnational in 
nature and involves an organized criminal group. 

 
The convention is therefore particularly relevant for cases involving forms of  organized crime. Without 
doubt, organized crime is involved in cybercrime. However, the extent of the involvement and therefore 
the relevance of UNTOC in transnational cybercrime investigations is uncertain. As a matter of fact, the 
determination of involvement of organized crime is highly relevant. However, analysing the link between 
identity-related crime and organized crime presents difficulties. The first main obstacle is the absence of 
scientifically reliable research in this area. Unlike the technical aspects of offences, the organized crime 
component of offences is less intensively analysed. There have been successful investigations identifying 
several  crime  gangs  involved  in  cybercrime.  However,  the  structure  of  those  groups  is  not  necessarily 
comparable to that of traditional organized crime groups. Cybercrime groups tend to have a looser and 
more flexible structure.2337 In addition, groups are often much smaller compared to traditional organized 
crime  groups.2338 The  Internet  enables  close  cooperation  with  others  and  coordination  of  activities 
without ever having met face-to-face. 2339 This makes it feasible for offenders to work together in fluid ad 
hoc groups.2340. 

Requests for mutual legal assistance 
The procedures for mutual legal assistance are defined in Art. 18. This provision contains a whole set of 
procedures.  
 
Article 18. Mutual legal assistance 
1. States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in investigations, 
prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered by this Convention as provided for 
in article 3 and shall reciprocally extend to one another similar assistance where the requesting State Party 
has  reasonable  grounds  to  suspect  that  the  offence  referred  to  in  article  3,  paragraph  1  (a)  or  (b),  is 
transnational in nature, including that vic-tims, witnesses, proceeds, instrumentalities or evidence of such 
offences  are  located  in  the  requested  State  Party  and  that  the  offence  involves  an  organized  criminal 
group. 
2.  Mutual  legal  assistance shall  be  afforded  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  under  relevant  laws, treaties, 
agreements and arrangements of the requested State Party with respect to investigations, prosecutions 
and  judicial  proceedings  in  relation  to  the  offences  for  which  a  legal  person  may  be  held  liable  in 
accordance with article 10 of this Convention in the requesting State Party.  
[...] 
 
Article 18  (1)-(2)  contains  general  principles  for  international  cooperation.2341 They  are  relevant  for 
cybercrime  investigation  as  well  as  traditional  investigation.  The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on 
Cybercrime contains similar regulation.  
 
Article 18. Mutual legal assistance 

268 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
[…] 
3. Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article may be requested for any of the 
following purposes: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(a) Taking evidence or statements from persons;  
(b) Effecting service of judicial documents;  
(c)Executing searches and seizures, and freezing;  
(d) Examining objects and sites; 
(e) Providing information, evidentiary items and expert evaluations;  
(f) Providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents and records, including government, 
bank, financial, corporate or business records; 
(g)  Identifying  or  tracing  proceeds  of  crime,  property,  instrumentalities  or  other  things  for 
evidentiary purposes; 
(h) Facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting State Party; 
(i)  Any  other  type  of  assistance  that  is  not  contrary  to  the  domestic  law  of  the  requested  State 
Party. 
[…] 

 

 
 

 
 
Article 18(3) contains specific mutual legal assistance requests. The list is complex and ranges from taking 
evidence to tracing proceeds of crime. As mentioned above, UNTOC does not contain specific wording for 
data-related  requests,  such  as  requests  to  intercept  communication  or  preserve  data.  However, 
Article 18(3)(i)  opens  the  provision  to  other  requests,  so  UNTOC  can  also  be  used  for  data-related 
requests.  While  it  is  in  general  worth  discussing  the  advantages  of  specific  regulation  of  requests, 
comparable regional instruments containing specific requests, like the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime,  usually  only  refer  to  procedural  instruments  in  national  law,  without  defining  specific 
procedures for mutual legal requests.  
 
Article 18. Mutual legal assistance 
[…] 
4.  Without  prejudice  to  domestic  law,  the  competent  authorities  of  a  State  Party  may,  without  prior 
request, transmit information relating to criminal matters to a competent authority in another State Party 
where  they  believe  that  such  information  could  assist  the  authority  in  undertaking  or  successfully 
concluding inquiries and criminal proceedings or could result in a request formulated by the latter State 
Party pursuant to this Convention. 
5. The transmission of information pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be without prejudice to 
inquiries and criminal proceedings in the State of the competent authorities providing the information. The 
competent authorities receiving the information shall comply with a request that said information remain 
confidential, even temporarily, or with restrictions on its use. However, this shall not prevent the receiving 
State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information that is exculpatory to an accused person. In such 
a case, the receiving State Party shall notify the transmitting State Party prior to the disclosure and, if so 
requested,  consult  with  the  transmitting  State  Party.  If,  in  an  exceptional  case,  advance  notice  is  not 
possible, the receiving State Party shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure without delay. 
[…] 
 
Article 18 (4)-(5) deals with intelligence sharing. It stipulates a form of cooperation2342 which takes place 
on  a  voluntary  basis,  without  the  need  for  the  receiving  party  to  submit  a  mutual  legal  assistance 
request.2343 It  covers  information  relating  to  criminal  matters,  such  as  information  about  potential 
consumers  of  child  pornography  located  in  another  country  that  has  been  discovered  during  an 
investigation. Especially in complex investigations, where recourse to formal mutual instruments is time-
consuming  and  hence  can  hinder  investigations,  law-enforcement  agencies  tend  to  shift  to  non-formal 
means of cooperation. However, information-sharing will only be able to work as a substitute if the state 
receiving  the  information  is  able  to  collect  all  relevant  evidence  on  its  own.  In  all  other  cases,  formal 
cooperation is usually required in any event in order to ensure the chain of custody. In the debate on 

 

269 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
shifting  international  cooperation  from  formal  requests  to  spontaneous  information  sharing,  it  is 
necessary to keep in mind that the formal process was developed to protect the integrity of a state as well 
the rights of the accused. Sharing of information should therefore not circumvent the dogmatic structure 
of mutual legal assistance.  
 
Article 18. Mutual legal assistance 
[…] 
6.  The  provisions  of  this  article  shall  not  affect  the  obligations  under  any  other  treaty,  bilateral  or 
multilateral, that governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal assistance. 
7.  Paragraphs  9  to  29  of  this  article  shall  apply  to  requests  made  pursuant  to  this  article  if  the  States 
Parties in question are not bound by a treaty of mutual legal assistance. If those States Parties are bound 
by such a treaty, the corresponding provisions of that treaty shall apply unless the States Parties agree to 
apply paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article in lieu thereof. States Parties are strongly encouraged to apply 
these paragraphs if they facilitate cooperation. 
8.States Parties shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant to this article on the ground of 
bank secrecy. 
9. States Parties may decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant to this article on the ground of 
absence of dual criminality. However, the requested State Party may, when it deems appropriate, provide 
assistance, to the extent it decides at its discretion, irrespective of whether the conduct would constitute 
an offence under the domestic law of the requested State Party. 
10.  A  person  who  is  being  detained  or  is  serving  a  sentence  in  the  territory  of  one  State  Party  whose 
presence  in  another  State  Party  is  requested  for  purposes  of  identification,  testimony  or  otherwise 
providing assistance in ob-taining evidence for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings in rela-
tion to offences covered by this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met: 
 
 

(a) The person freely gives his or her informed consent;  
(b)  The  competent  authorities  of  both  States  Parties  agree,  subject  to  such  conditions  as  those 
States Parties may deem appropriate.  

11.For the purposes of paragraph 10 of this article: 
 

(a)  The  State Party  to  which  the  person is  transferred  shall  have  the  authority  and  obligation  to 
keep  the  person  transferred  in  custody,  unless  other-  wise  requested  or  authorized  by  the  State 
Party from which the person was transferred; 
(b) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to 
return  the  person  to  the  custody  of  the  State  Party  from  which  the  person  was  transferred  as 
agreed beforehand, or as otherwise agreed, by the competent authorities of both States Parties; 
(c) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall not require the State Party from which 
the person was transferred to initiate extradition pro-ceedings for the return of the person; 
(d) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State 
from which he or she was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State Party to which he or 
she was transferred. 

12.  Unless  the  State  Party  from  which  a  person  is  to  be  transferred  in  accordance  with  paragraphs  10 
and 11  of  this  article  so  agrees,  that  person,  whatever  his  or  her  nationality,  shall  not  be  prosecuted, 
detained, punished or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory of the 
State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts, omissions or convictions prior to his or her 
departure from the territory of the State from which he or she was transferred. 
[…] 
 
Article 18  (6)-(12)  deals  with  procedural  aspects  of  mutual  legal  assistance.  Of  particular  interest  for 
cybercrime  cases  are  paragraphs 8  and  9.  Paragraph 9  enables  states  to  decline  mutual  assistance 
requests on the grounds of absence of dual criminality. This is particularly important insofar as the scope 
of  approaches  to  harmonize  substantive  criminal  provisions  with  regard  to  cybercrime  –  such  as  the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime – is currently limited. By mid-2010, only 30 countries had 
ratified this instrument and set corresponding minimum standards with regard to cybercrime offences. 
This can hinder cooperation based on UNTOC.

Article 18. Mutual legal assistance 
[…] 
13. Each State Party shall designate a central authority that shall have the responsibility and power to 
receive  requests  for  mutual  legal  assistance  and  either  to  execute  them  or  to  transmit  them  to  the 
competent authorities for execution. Where a State Party has a special region or territory with a separate 
system of mutual legal assistance, it may designate a distinct central authority that shall have the same 
function for that region or territory. Central authorities shall ensure the speedy and proper execution or 
transmission of the requests received. Where the central authority transmits the request to a competent 
authority  for  execution,  it  shall  encourage  the  speedy  and  proper  execution  of  the  request  by  the 
competent authority. The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the central authority 
designated for this purpose at the time each State Party deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance 
or  approval  of  or  accession  to  this  Convention.  Requests  for  mutual  legal  assistance  and  any 
communication  related  thereto  shall  be  transmitted  to  the  central  authorities  designated  by  the  States 
Parties.  This  requirement  shall  be  without  prejudice  to  the  right  of  a  State  Party  to  require  that  such 
requests  and  communications  be  addressed  to 
in  urgent 
circumstances, where the States Parties agree, through the International Criminal Police Organization, if 
possible. 
14. Requests shall be made in writing or, where possible, by any means capable of producing a written 
record, in a language acceptable to the requested State Party, under conditions allowing that State Party 
to establish authenticity. The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the language or 
languages acceptable to each State Party at the time it deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance 
or approval of or accession to this Convention. In urgent circumstances and where agreed by the States 
Parties, requests may be made orally, but shall be confirmed in writing forthwith. 
15. A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain: 
 
 

it  through  diplomatic  channels  and, 

 

 

(a) The identity of the authority making the request; 
(b) The subject matter and nature of the investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding to which 
the  request  relates  and  the  name  and  functions  of  the  authority  conducting  the  investigation, 
prosecution or judicial proceeding; 
(c)  A  summary  of  the  relevant  facts,  except  in  relation  to  requests  for  the  purpose  of  service  of 
judicial documents; 
(d)  A  description  of  the  assistance  sought  and  details  of  any  particular  procedure  that  the 
requesting State Party wishes to be followed; 
(e)Where possible, the identity, location and nationality of any person concerned; and 
(f) The purpose for which the evidence, information or action is sought. 

 
 
16.  The  requested  State  Party  may  request  additional  information  when  it  appears  necessary  for  the 
execution of the request in accordance with its domestic law or when it can facilitate such execution. 
[…] 
 
Article 18 (13)-(16) defines the form and content of requests, as well as the channels of communication. 
With regard to channels of communication, the Convention follows the idea that requests are transmitted 
from  central  authority  to  central  authority.2344 The  Convention  underscores  the  importance  of  this 
procedure  to ensure  speedy  and  proper execution  of the  request. The  roles  of  central  authorities  may 
differ, and range from direct involvement in handling and executing requests to forwarding them to the 
competent authorities. The Convention leaves it up to states whether to require the transmittal through 
diplomatic channels. This latter option being a lengthy process, such a procedure would dramatically slow 
down  transmission  and  especially  hinder  expedited  measures  such  as  the  preservation  of  traffic  data. 
Unlike the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime,2345 UNTOC does not define means of expedited 
cooperation,  but  provides  a  general  procedure  for  cases  of  urgency.  If  states  agree,  the  International 
Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) can be used as a channel for communication. In order to facilitate 
identification of the relevant authority in another country, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes 
(UNODC)  maintains  an  online  directory.2346 It  provides  the  issuing  authority  with  details  of  the  central 
authority of the requested state, the channels of communication and other relevant information.2347

When  submitting  the  request,  it  is  necessary  to  meet  the  formal  requirements  as  defined  by 
paragraphs 14  and 15.  Oral  requests  are  only  permitted  in  urgent  cases  and  need  to  be  followed  by  a 
written  request.  The  reports  of  the  State  Parties  concerning  application  of  the  Convention  show  that 
while  many  states  have  legislation  requiring  MLA  requests  to  be  made  in  writing,  only  a  handful  of 
countries  have  admitted  temporary  advance  requests  forwarded  by  e-mail.2348 In  this  respect,  UNTOC 
differs from the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which encourages states to use means of 
electronic communication in urgent cases.2349 UNODC provides a software for drafting such requests with 
the aim of ensuring that requests are complete (Mutual Legal Assistance Request Writer Tool).2350 
 
Article 18. Mutual legal assistance 
[…] 
17. A request shall be executed in accordance with the domestic law of the requested State Party and, to 
the  extent  not  contrary  to  the  domestic  law  of  the  requested  State  Party  and  where  possible,  in 
accordance with the procedures specified in the request. 
18. Wherever possible and consistent with fundamental principles of domestic law, when an individual is in 
the  territory  of  a  State  Party  and  has  to  be  heard  as  a  witness  or  expert  by  the  judicial  authorities  of 
another State Party, the first State Party may, at the request of the other, permit the hearing to take place 
by video conference if it is not possible or desirable for the individual in question to appear in person in the 
territory of the requesting State Party. States Parties may agree that the hearing shall be conducted by a 
judicial authority of the requesting State Party and attended by a judicial authority of the requested State 
Party. 
19.  The  requesting  State  Party  shall  not  transmit  or  use  information  or  evidence  furnished  by  the 
requested State Party for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings other than those stated in 
the request without the prior consent of the requested State Party. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent 
the requesting State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information or evi-dence that is exculpatory 
to an accused person. In the latter case, the requesting State Party shall notify the requested State Party 
prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with the requested State Party. If, in an exceptional 
case, advance notice is not possible, the requesting State Party shall inform the requested State Party of 
the disclosure without delay. 
20. The requesting State Party may require that the requested State Party keep confidential the fact and 
substance of the request, except to the extent necessary to execute the request. If the requested State 
Party cannot comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting State 
Party. 
21. Mutual legal assistance may be refused: 
 
 

(a) If the request is not made in conformity with the provisions of this article; 
(b)  If  the  requested  State  Party  considers  that  execution  of  the  request  is  likely  to  prejudice  its 
sovereignty, security, ordre public or other essential interests; 
(c)  If  the  authorities  of  the  requested  State  Party  would  be  prohibited  by  its  domestic  law  from 
carrying  out  the  action  requested  with  regard  to  any  similar  offence,  had  it  been  subject  to 
investigation, prosecution or judicial proceedings under their own jurisdiction; 
(d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested State Party relating to mutual legal 
assistance for the request to be granted. 

22. States Parties may not refuse a request for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground that the offence 
is also considered to involve fiscal matters. 
23. Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal assistance. 
24. The requested State Party shall execute the request for mutual legal assistance as soon as possible and 
shall  take  as full  account  as  possible  of  any  deadlines  suggested  by  the  requesting  State  Party  and  for 
which reasons are given, preferably in the request. The requested State Party shall respond to reasonable 
requests  by  the  requesting  State  Party on  progress  of  its  handling  of  the  request.  The  requesting  State 
Party shall promptly inform the requested State Party when the assistance sought is no longer required. 
25.  Mutual  legal  assistance  may  be  postponed  by  the  requested  State  Party  on  the  ground  that  it 
interferes with an ongoing investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding. 

 

 

272 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
26. Before refusing a request pursuant to paragraph 21 of this article or postponing its execution pursuant 
to paragraph 25 of this article, the requested State Party shall consult with the requesting State Party to 
consider whether assistance may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as it deems necessary. If 
the  requesting  State  Party  accepts  assistance  subject  to  those  con-ditions,  it  shall  comply  with  the 
conditions. 
27. Without prejudice to the application of paragraph 12 of this article, a witness, expert or other person 
who, at the request of the requesting State Party, consents to give evidence in a proceeding or to assist in 
an investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding in the territory of the requesting State Party shall not 
be prosecuted, detained, punished or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in that 
territory in respect of acts, omissions or convictions prior to his or her departure from the territory of the 
requested State Party. Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness, expert or other person having had, 
for a period of fifteen consecutive days or for any period agreed upon by the States Parties from the date 
on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial 
authorities,  an  opportunity  of  leaving,  has  nevertheless  remained  voluntarily  in  the  territory  of  the 
requesting State Party or, having left it, has returned of his or her own free will. 
28.  The  ordinary  costs  of  executing  a  request  shall  be  borne  by  the  re-  quested  State  Party,  unless 
otherwise agreed by the States Parties concerned. If expenses of a substantial or extraordinary nature are 
or will be required to fulfil the request, the States Parties shall consult to determine the terms and condi-
tions under which the request will be executed, as well as the manner in which the costs shall be borne. 
29. The requested State Party: 
 

(a)  Shall  provide  to  the  requesting  State  Party  copies  of  government  records,  documents  or 
information in its possession that under its domestic law are available to the general public; 
(b) May, at its discretion, provide to the requesting State Party in whole, in part or subject to such 
conditions as it deems appropriate, copies of any government records, documents or information in 
its possession that under its domestic law are not available to the general public. 

 

30. States Parties shall consider, as may be necessary, the possibility of concluding bilateral or multilateral 
agreements  or  arrangements  that  would  serve  the  purposes  of,  give  practical  effect  to  or  enhance  the 
provisions of this article. 
 

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 

6.6.5 
The  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Cybercrime  (the  “Convention  on  Cybercrime”)  addresses  the 
increasing importance of international cooperation in Articles 23 to 35.  

General Principles for International Cooperation  
Article 23 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime defines three general principles regarding 
international cooperation in cybercrime investigations among members. 
 
Article 23 – General principles relating to international co-operation  
The  Parties  shall  co-operate  with  each  other,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  and 
through  the  application  of  relevant  international  instruments  on  international  co-operation  in  criminal 
matters, arrangements agreed on the basis of uniform or reciprocal legislation, and domestic laws, to the 
widest  extent  possible  for  the  purposes  of  investigations  or  proceedings  concerning  criminal  offences 
related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal 
offence.  
 
First  of  all,  members  are  supposed  to  provide  cooperation  in  international  investigation  to  the  widest 
extent  possible.  This  obligation  reflects  the  importance  of  international  cooperation  in  cybercrime 
investigations.  In  addition,  Article 23  notes  that  the  general  principles  do  not  only  apply  in  cybercrime 
investigations,  but  in  any  investigation  where  evidence  in  electronic  form  needs  to  be  collected.  This 
covers cybercrime investigations as well as investigations in traditional cases. If the suspect in a murder 
case has used an e-mail service abroad, Article 23 would be applicable with regard investigations that are 

 

273 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
necessary in regard to data stored by the host provider.2351 The third principle notes that the provisions 
dealing  with  international  cooperation  do  not  substitute  provisions  of  international  agreements 
pertaining to mutual legal assistance and extradition or relevant provisions of domestic law pertaining to 
international  cooperation.  The  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  emphasized  that  mutual 
assistance  should  in  general  be  carried  out  through  the  application  of  relevant  treaties  and  similar 
arrangements for mutual assistance. As a consequence, the Convention on Cybercrime does not intend to 
create a separate general regime on mutual assistance. Therefore, only in those cases where the existing 
treaties, laws and arrangements do not already contain such provisions, each Party is required to establish 
a  legal  basis  to  enable  the  carrying  out  of  international  cooperation  as  defined  by  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime.2352  

Extradition 
The  extradition  of  nationals  remains  one  of  the  most  difficult  aspects  of  international  cooperation.2353 
Requests for extradition very often lead to conflict between the need to protect the citizen and the need 
to support an ongoing investigation in a country abroad. Article 24 defines the principles of extradition. 
Unlike Article 23, the provision is limited to the offences mentioned in the Convention on Cybercrime and 
does  not  apply  in  cases  that  are  minor  (deprivation  of  liberty  for  a  maximum  period  of  at  least  one 
year2354).  To  avoid  conflicts  that  could  occur  with  the  regard  to  the  ability  of  the  parties  to  make 
reservations, Article 24 is based on the principle of dual criminality.2355  
 
Article 24 – Extradition  
1a This article applies to extradition between Parties for the criminal offences established in accordance 
with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, provided that they are punishable under the laws of both 
Parties concerned by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of at least one year, or by a more severe 
penalty.  
b.  Where  a  different  minimum  penalty  is  to  be  applied  under  an  arrangement  agreed  on  the  basis  of 
uniform or reciprocal legislation or an extradition treaty, including the European Convention on Extradition 
(ETS  No.  24),  applicable  between  two  or  more  parties,  the  minimum  penalty  provided  for  under  such 
arrangement or treaty shall apply. 
2.  The  criminal  offences  described  in  paragraph  1  of  this  article  shall  be  deemed  to  be  included  as 
extraditable  offences  in  any  extradition  treaty  existing  between  or  among  the  Parties.  The  Parties 
undertake  to  include  such  offences  as  extraditable  offences  in  any  extradition  treaty  to  be  concluded 
between or among them. 
3.  If  a  Party  that  makes  extradition  conditional  on  the  existence  of  a  treaty  receives  a  request  for 
extradition  from  another  Party  with  which  it  does  not  have  an  extradition  treaty,  it  may  consider  this 
Convention  as  the  legal  basis  for  extradition  with  respect  to  any  criminal  offence  referred  to  in 
paragraph 1 of this article. 
4. Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognise the criminal 
offences referred to in paragraph 1 of this article as extraditable offences between themselves. 
5.  Extradition  shall  be  subject  to  the  conditions  provided  for  by  the  law  of  the  requested  Party  or  by 
applicable extradition treaties, including the grounds on which the requested Party may refuse extradition. 
6. If extradition for a criminal offence referred to in paragraph 1 of this article is refused solely on the basis 
of the nationality of the person sought, or because the requested Party deems that it has jurisdiction over 
the  offence,  the  requested  Party  shall  submit  the  case  at  the  request  of  the  requesting  Party  to  its 
competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution and shall report the final outcome to the requesting 
Party  in  due  course.  Those  authorities  shall  take  their  decision  and  conduct  their  investigations  and 
proceedings in the same manner as for any other offence of a comparable nature under the law of that 
Party. 
7a. Each Party shall, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, 
approval  or  accession,  communicate  to  the  Secretary  General  of  the  Council  of  Europe  the  name  and 
address of each authority responsible for making or receiving requests for extradition or provisional arrest 
in the absence of a treaty.  

274 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
b. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe shall set up and keep updated a register of authorities so 
designated by the Parties. Each Party shall ensure that the details held on the register are correct at all 
times. 

General Principles of Mutual Assistance 
With regard to mutual assistance, Article 25 complements the principles set out in Article 23. One of the 
most  important  regulations  in  Article 25  is  paragraph 3,  which  highlights  the  importance  of  fast 
communication  in  cybercrime  investigations.2356 As  pointed  out  previously,  a  number  of  cybercrime 
investigations at the national level fail because the investigations take too long and important data are 
therefore  deleted  before  procedural  measures  to  preserve  them  are  undertaken.2357 Investigations  that 
require mutual legal assistance usually take even longer, due to the time-consuming formal requirements 
in  the  communications  of  law-enforcement  agencies.  The  Convention  on  Cybercrime  addresses  this 
problem by highlighting the importance of enabling the use of expedited means of communication.2358  
 
Article 25 – General principles relating to mutual assistance  
1. The Parties shall afford one another mutual assistance to the widest extent possible for the purpose of 
investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for 
the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence. 
2. Each Party shall also adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to carry out the 
obligations set forth in Articles 27 through 35.  
3.  Each  Party  may,  in  urgent  circumstances,  make  requests  for  mutual  assistance  or  communications 
related  thereto  by  expedited  means  of  communication,  including  fax  or  e-mail,  to  the  extent  that  such 
means provide appropriate levels of security and authentication (including the use of encryption, where 
necessary),  with  formal  confirmation  to  follow,  where  required  by  the  requested  Party.  The  requested 
Party shall accept and respond to the request by any such expedited means of communication. 
4. Except as otherwise specifically provided in articles in this chapter, mutual assistance shall be subject to 
the conditions provided for by the law of the requested Party or by applicable mutual assistance treaties, 
including the grounds on which the requested Party may refuse co-operation. The requested Party shall 
not  exercise  the  right  to  refuse  mutual  assistance  in  relation  to  the  offences  referred  to  in  Articles  2 
through 11 solely on the ground that the request concerns an offence which it considers a fiscal offence. 
5.  Where,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  the  requested  Party  is  permitted  to  make 
mutual  assistance  conditional  upon  the  existence  of  dual  criminality,  that  condition  shall  be  deemed 
fulfilled,  irrespective  of  whether  its  laws  place  the  offence  within  the  same  category  of  offence  or 
denominate the offence by the same terminology as the requesting Party, if the conduct underlying the 
offence for which assistance is sought is a criminal offence under its laws. 
 
In  the  course  of  cybercrime  investigations  carried  out  on  a  national  level,  links  to  offences  related  to 
another  country  may  be  discovered.  If  law-enforcement  agencies,  for  example,  investigate  a  child-
pornography  case,  they  may  find  information  about  paedophiles  from  other  countries  who  have 
participated  in  the  exchange  of  child  pornography.2359 Article 26  sets  out  the  regulations  that  are 
necessary for law-enforcement agencies to inform foreign law-enforcement agencies without jeopardizing 
their own investigation.2360  
 
Article 26 – Spontaneous information 
1. A Party may, within the limits of its domestic law and without prior request, forward to another Party 
information obtained within the framework of its own investigations when it considers that the disclosure 
of  such  information  might  assist  the  receiving  Party  in  initiating  or  carrying  out  investigations  or 
proceedings concerning criminal offences established in accordance with this Convention or might lead to 
a request for co-operation by that Party under this chapter. 

 

275 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
2. Prior to providing such information, the providing Party may request that it be kept confidential or only 
used  subject  to  conditions.  If  the  receiving  Party  cannot  comply  with  such  request,  it  shall  notify  the 
providing Party, which shall then determine whether the information should nevertheless be provided. If 
the receiving Party accepts the information subject to the conditions, it shall be bound by them. 
 
As pointed out above, there are certain concerns related to the replacement of mutual legal assistance by 
spontaneous  information.  Information  sharing  will  only  be  able  to  work  if  the  state  receiving  the 
information is able to collect all relevant evidence on its own. In all other cases, formal cooperation is 
usually  required  in  any  event  in  order  to  ensure  the  chain  of  custody.  In  the  debate  on  shifting 
international  cooperation  from  formal  requests  to  spontaneous  information  sharing,  it  is  necessary  to 
keep in mind that the formal process was developed to protect the integrity of a state as well the rights of 
the accused. Sharing of information should therefore not circumvent the dogmatic structure of mutual 
legal assistance. 
One of the most important regulations of Article 26 relates to the confidentiality of information. Given 
that a number of investigations can only be carried out successfully if the offender is not aware of the 
investigations  taking  place,  Article 26  enables  the  providing  party  to  request  confidentiality  for  the 
information  transmitted.  If  the  confidentiality  cannot  be  granted,  the  providing  party  can  refuse  the 
information process.  

Procedures  pertaining  to  mutual  assistance  requests  in  the  absence  of  applicable  international 
agreements 
Like Article 25, Article 27 is based on the idea that mutual legal assistance should be carried out through 
application of relevant treaties and similar arrangements instead of solely referring to the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime decided not to establish a separate mandatory 
mutual legal assistance regime within the Convention on Cybercrime.2361 If other instruments are already 
in place, Articles 27 and 28 are not relevant within a concrete request. Only in those cases where other 
regulations are not applicable, Articles 27 and 28 provide a set of mechanisms that can be used to carry 
out mutual legal assistance requests.  
The  most  important  aspects  regulated  by  Article 27  include  the  obligation  to  establish  a  designated 
contact point for mutual legal assistance requests2362, requirements of direct communication between the 
contact  points  to  avoid  lengthy  procedures2363 and  creation  of  a  database  of  all  contact  points  by  the 
Secretary General of the Council of Europe. 
In addition, Article 27 defines limitations with regard to requests for assistance. Parties to the Convention 
on Cybercrime can especially refuse cooperation with regard to political offences or if it considers that the 
cooperation could prejudice its sovereignty, security, public order or other essential interests.  
The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime saw the need on the one hand to enable the parties to 
refuse cooperation in certain cases but on the other hand pointed out that the parties should exercise the 
refusal of cooperation with restraint in order to avoid conflict with the principles set out previously.2364 It 
is  therefore  especially  important  to  define  the  term  “other  essential  interests”  in  a  narrow  way.  The 
Explanatory  Report  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  points  out  that  this  could  be  the  case  if  the 
cooperation  could  lead  to  fundamental  difficulties  for  the  requested  party.2365 From  the  drafters’ 
perspective,  concerns  related  to  inadequate  data-protection  laws  are  not  considered  to  be  essential 
interests.2366  

Mutual assistance regarding provisional measures 
Arts. 28-33  are  a  reflection  of  the  procedural  instruments  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime.2367 The 
Convention  on  Cybercrime  contains  a  number  of  procedural  instruments  that  are  designed  to  improve 
investigations  in  Member  States.2368 With  regard  to  the  principle  of  national  sovereignty2369,  these 
instruments  can  only  be  used  for  investigations  at  the  national  level.2370 If  investigators  realize  that 
evidence needs to be collected outside their territory, they need to request mutual legal assistance. In 

276 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
addition to Article 18, each of the instruments established by Arts. 16-21 has a corresponding provision in 
Arts. 28-33 which enables law-enforcement agencies to apply the procedural instruments on request of a 
foreign law-enforcement agency.

Transborder access to stored computer data 
In  addition  to  purely  mirroring  procedural  provisions,  the  drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime 
discussed  under  which  circumstances  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  access  computer  data 
that are neither stored in their territory nor under the control of a person in their territory. They were 
only  able  to  agree  on  two  case  scenarios  where  an  investigation  should  be  carried  out  by  one  law-
enforcement  agency  without  the  need  to  request  mutual  legal  assistance.2377 Further  agreements  were 
not  possible2378 and  even  the  solution  reached  is  still  criticized  by  Member  States  of  the  Council  of 
Europe.2379  
The two cases where law-enforcement agencies are allowed to access data stored outside their territory 
are related to:  

•  publicly available information; and/or 
•  access with the consent of the person in control. 

 

Article 32 – Trans-border access to stored computer data with consent or where publicly available 
A Party may, without the authorisation of another Party: 
 

a.  access  publicly  available  (open  source)  stored  computer  data,  regardless  of  where  the  data  is 
located geographically; or 
b. access or receive, through a computer system in its territory, stored computer data located in 
another  Party,  if  the  Party  obtains  the  lawful  and  voluntary  consent  of  the  person  who  has  the 
lawful authority to disclose the data to the Party through that computer system. 

 

 
Other forms of transborder access are not covered by Article 32, but nor are they precluded.2380  
Article 32  notes  that  if  the  relevant  data  are  publicly  available,  foreign  law-enforcement  agencies  are 
allowed  to  access  this  information.  An  example  of  publicly  available  information  is  information  made 
available  on  websites  without  access  control  (such  as  passwords).  If  investigators  were  not  allowed  – 
unlike any other user –to access these websites, this could seriously hinder their work. Therefore, this first 
situation addressed by Article 32 is widely accepted.  
The  second  situation  in  which  law-enforcement  agencies  are  allowed  to  access  stored  computer  data 
outside their territory is when the investigators have obtained the lawful and voluntary consent of the 
person who has lawful authority to disclose the data. This authorization is heavily criticized.2381  
One main concern is the fact that the provision in its current wording probably contradicts fundamental 
principles  of  international  law.2382 Based  on  international  law,  investigators  have  to  respect  national 
sovereignty  during  an  investigation.2383 They  are  especially  not  allowed  to  carry  out  investigations  in 
another state without the consent of the competent authorities in that state. The decision whether such 
permission  should  be  granted  is  not  in  the  hands  of  an  individual,  but  of  the  state  authorities,  since 

 

277 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
interference  with  national  sovereignty  does  not  only  affect  the  rights  of  the  individual,  but  also  state 
concerns.  By  ratifying  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime,  countries  partly  dismiss  the  principle  and  allow 
other countries to carry out investigations affecting their territory.  
Another concern is the fact that Article 32b does not define procedures for the investigation. Based on 
the text of the provision, it is not necessary for the same limitations to be applied that exist in domestic 
law  with  regard  to  comparable  domestic  investigations.  Interestingly  enough,  such  a  restriction  was 
included in the draft text of the Convention on Cybercrime presented in the beginning of 2000, but was 
removed in the 22nd draft.2384  
By creating Article 32 sub-paragraph b, the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime ultimately violated 
the  dogmatic  structure  of  the  mutual  legal  assistance  regime  in  this  Convention.  With  Article 18,  the 
drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  enabled  investigators  to  order  the  submission  of  data  in 
domestic  investigations.  If  law-enforcement  agencies  were  to  be  authorized  to  use  this  instrument  in 
international  investigations,  it  would  have  been  sufficient  to  include  it  in  the  catalogue  of  instruments 
mentioned  in  the  context  of  mutual  legal  assistance.  However,  the  instrument  cannot  be  applied  in 
international  investigations  because  the  corresponding  provision  in  Chapter 3  of  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime,  dealing  with  international  cooperation,  is  lacking.  Instead  of  relinquishing  the  dogmatic 
structure by allowing foreign investigators to contact directly the person who has control over the data 
and  ask  for  the  submission  of  the  data,  the  drafters  could  have  simply  implemented  a  corresponding 
provision in Chapter 3 of the Convention.2385  
Transborder  access  to  stored  computer  data  was  also  discussed  in  Moscow  at  the  1999  G8 Ministerial 
Conference on Combating Transnational Organized Crimes.2386 One of the outcomes of the meeting was a 
collection  of  principles  regarding  transborder  access.2387 This  was  in  all  likelihood  the  model  for  the 
regulation used by the drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime, and therefore shows similarities.  
 
6. Transborder Access to Stored Data not Requiring Legal Assistance 
Notwithstanding anything in these Principles, a State need not obtain authorization from another State 
when it is acting in accordance with its national law for the purpose of:  
 

(a) accessing publicly available (open source) data, regardless of where the data is geographically 
located  
(b) accessing, searching, copying, or seizing data stored in a computer system located in another 
State, if acting in accordance with the lawful and voluntary consent of a person who has the lawful 
authority  to  disclose  to  it  that  data.  The  searching  State  should  consider  notifying  the  searched 
State, if such notification is permitted by national law and the data reveals a violation of criminal 
law or otherwise appears to be of interest to the searched State.  

 

 
The main difference is the notification procedure in 6 (b). The intention of the provision is intelligence 
sharing. However, with slight modifications, such a provision could ensure that affected states are aware 
of investigations taking place in their own territory. It would not prevent conflict with international law, 
but at least guarantee a certain degree of transparency.  

24/7 Network of contacts  
Cybercrime investigations often require immediate reaction.2388 As explained above, this is especially the 
case when it comes to the traffic data that are necessary to identify a suspect, as they are often deleted 
within  a  rather  short  period  of  time.2389 To  increase  the  speed  of  international  investigations,  the 
Convention  on  Cybercrime  highlights  the  importance  of  enabling  the  use  of  expedited  means  of 
communication in Article 25. In order to further improve the efficiency of mutual assistance requests, the 
drafters  of  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  oblige  the  parties  to  designate  a  contact  point  for  mutual 
assistance requests, who shall be available without time limitations.2390 The drafters of the Convention on 
Cybercrime  emphasized  that  establishment  of  the  points  of  contact  is  one  of  the  most  important 
instruments provided by the Convention.2391 However, a recent review of the use of 24/7 network points 
in countries that have ratified the Convention on Cybercrime shows that its use is very limited. 
 

278 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

a. the provision of technical advice; 
b. the preservation of data pursuant to Articles 29 and 30;  
c. the collection of evidence, the provision of legal information, and locating of suspects. 

 
Article 35 – 24/7 Network  
1. Each Party shall designate a point of contact available on a twenty-four hour, seven-day-a-week basis, 
in order to ensure the provision of immediate assistance for the purpose of investigations or proceedings 
concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in 
electronic  form  of  a  criminal  offence.  Such  assistance  shall  include  facilitating,  or,  if  permitted  by  its 
domestic law and practice, directly carrying out the following measures: 
 
 
 
2a.  A  Party’s  point  of  contact  shall  have  the  capacity  to  carry  out  communications  with  the  point  of 
contact of another Party on an expedited basis. 
b.  If  the  point  of  contact  designated  by  a  Party  is  not  part  of  that  Party’s  authority  or  authorities 
responsible for international mutual assistance or extradition, the point of contact shall ensure that it is 
able to co-ordinate with such authority or authorities on an expedited basis. 
3.  Each  Party  shall  ensure  that  trained  and  equipped  personnel  are  available,  in  order  to  facilitate  the 
operation of the network. 
 
The idea of the 24/7 Network is based on the existing network for 24-hour contacts for International High-
Tech  and  Computer-related  Crime  from  the  G8  Group  of  Nations.2392 With  the  creation  of  a  network 
of 24/7  contact  points,  the  drafters  of the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  aim  to  address  the  challenges  of 
fighting  cybercrime  –  especially  those  associated  with  the  speed  of  data  exchange  processes2393 and 
having  an  international  dimension.2394 The  parties  to  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  are  obliged  to 
establish such contact points and ensure that they are able to carry out certain immediate action, as well 
as maintain the service. As stated in Article 35 paragraph 3 of the Convention, this includes trained and 
equipped personnel.  
With regard to the process of establishing the contact point and especially to the fundamental principles 
of  this  structure,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime  allows  the  Member  States  maximum  flexibility.  The 
Convention  neither  requires  the  creation  of  a  new  authority,  nor  defines  to  which  of  the  existing 
authorities the contact point could or should be attached. The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime 
further pointed out that the fact that the 24/7 network point is intended to provide technical as well as 
legal assistance will lead to various possible solutions regarding its implementation.  
With regard to cybercrime investigations, the installation of the contact points has two main functions, 
namely speeding up communication by providing a single point of contact; and speeding up investigations 
by authorizing the contact point to carry out certain investigations right away. The combination of both 
functions  has  the  potential  to  converge  the  speed  of  international  investigations  to  the  level  reached 
within national investigations.  
Article 32 of the Convention on Cybercrime defines the minimum required abilities of the network point. 
Apart from technical assistance and the provision of legal information, the main tasks of the contact point 
include the preservation of data, the collection of evidence and the locating of suspects. 
In this context, it is again important to highlight that the Convention on Cybercrime does not prescribe 
which  authority  should  be  responsible  for  operating  the  24/7  contact  point.  If  the  contact  point  is 
operated by an authority that has competence to order the preservation of data,2395 and a foreign contact 
point requests such preservation, the measure can immediately be ordered by the local contact point. If 
the contact point is run by an authority that is not competent to order the preservation of data itself, it is 
important that the contact point shall have the ability to straight away contact the competent authorities 
to ensure that the measure is carried out immediately.2396  
At  the  2nd  Meeting  of  the  Cybercrime  Convention  Committee,  it  was  explicitly  pointed  out  that  the 
participation  in  the  24/7  network  of  contacts  does  not  require  the  signature  or  ratification  of  the 
Convention on Cybercrime.2397  

 

279 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
In 2008, the Council of Europe published a study analysing the effectiveness of international cooperation 
against cybercrime.2398 In 2009, a specific study on the functioning of 24/7 points of contact for cybercrime 
was undertaken.2399 One result of the studies is that not all countries which have ratified the Convention 
on Cybercrime have created functioning 24/7 network points as required by the Convention. A second 
result is that countries which have established contact points often only use it for very limited purposes 
such as the preservation of traffic data.  

International Cooperation in the Stanford Draft International Convention 

6.6.6 
The  drafters  of  the  Stanford  Draft  International  Convention  (the  “Stanford  Draft”)2400 recognized  the 
importance of the international dimension of cybercrime and the related challenges. In order to address 
these  challenges,  they  incorporated  specific  provisions  that  deal  with  international  cooperation.  The 
provisions cover the following topics:  

•  Article 6 – Mutual legal assistance 
•  Article 7 – Extradition 
•  Article 8 – Prosecution 
•  Article 9 – Provisional remedies 
•  Article 10 – Entitlements of an accused person 
•  Article 11 – Cooperation in law enforcement  

This approach shows a number of similarities to the approach taken in the Council of Europe Convention 
on  Cybercrime.  The  main  difference  is  the  fact  that  the  regulations  provided  by  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime  are  stricter,  more  complex  and  more  precisely  defined  compared  to the  Stanford Draft.  As 
pointed out by the drafters of the Stanford Draft, the approach of the Convention on Cybercrime is more 
practical and therefore has some clear advantages in terms of actual application.2401 The drafters of the 
Stanford Draft decided to follow a different approach, as they predicted that the implementation of new 
technology  could  lead  to  some  difficulties.  As  a  result,  they  only  provided  some  general  instructions 
without specifying them further.2402

Introduction 

to 

Internet 

Introduction 

6.7.1 
Committing a cybercrime automatically involves a number of people and businesses, even if the offender 
acts alone. Due to the structure of the Internet, the transmission of a simple e-mail requires the service of 
a number of providers.2403 In addition to the e-mail provider, the transmission involves access providers as 
well as routers who forward the e-mail to the recipient. The situation is similar for the downloading of 
movies  containing  child  pornography.  The  downloading  process  involves  the  content  provider  who 
uploaded the pictures (for example on a website), the hosting provider who provided the storage media 
for  the  website,  the  routers  who  forwarded  the  files  to  the  user,  and  finally  the  access  provider  who 
enabled the user to access the Internet.  
Because of this involvement by multiple parties, Internet service providers have long since been at the 
centre of criminal investigations involving offenders who use the ISPs’ services to commit an offence.2404 
One of the main reasons for this development is that, even when the offender is acting from abroad, the 
providers located within the country’s national borders are a suitable subject for criminal investigations 
without violating the principle of national sovereignty.2405  
The fact that, on the one hand, cybercrime cannot be committed without the involvement of providers, 
and, on the other hand, providers often do not have the ability to prevent these crimes, has led to the 
question  whether  the  responsibility  of  Internet  providers  needs  to  be  limited.2406 The  answer  to  the 
question is critical for economic development of the ICT infrastructure. Providers will only operate their 
services if they are able to avoid criminalization within their regular mode of operation. In addition, law-
enforcement agencies also have a keen interest in this question. The work of law-enforcement agencies 
very  often  depends  on  cooperation  of,  and  with,  Internet  providers.  This  raises  some  concern,  since 
limiting the liability of Internet providers for acts committed by their users could have an impact on the 
ISPs’ cooperation and support for cybercrime investigations, as well as on the actual prevention of crime.  

The United States approach  

6.7.2 
There  are  different  approaches  taken  to  balance  the  need  for  actively  involving  providers  in  the 
investigations on the one hand, and limiting the risks of criminal liability for third parties action on the 
other.2407 An example of a legislative approach can be found in 17 USC. §§ 517(a) and (b).  
 
§ 512. Limitations on liability relating to material online 
(a) Transitory Digital Network Communications 
A  service  provider  shall  not  be  liable  for  monetary  relief,  or,  except  as  provided  in  subsection  (j),  for 
injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider’s transmitting, 
routing, or providing connections for, material through a system or network controlled or operated by or 
for  the  service  provider,  or  by  reason  of  the  intermediate  and transient  storage of  that  material  in  the 
course of such transmitting, routing, or providing connections, if – 
 

 

 

 

(1) the transmission of the material was initiated by or at the direction of a person other than the 
service provider; 
(2)  the  transmission,  routing,  provision  of  connections,  or  storage  is  carried  out  through  an 
automatic technical process without selection of the material by the service provider; 
(3)  the  service  provider  does  not  select  the  recipients  of  the  material  except  as  an  automatic 
response to the request of another person; 
(4)  no  copy  of  the  material  made  by  the  service  provider  in  the  course  of  such  intermediate  or 
transient  storage  is  maintained  on  the  system  or  network  in  a  manner  ordinarily  accessible  to 
anyone other than anticipated recipients, and no such copy is maintained on the system or network 
in  a  manner  ordinarily  accessible  to  such  anticipated  recipients  for  a  longer  period  than  is 
reasonably necessary for the transmission, routing, or provision of connections; and 
(5) the material is transmitted through the system or network without modification of its content. 

 
(b) System Caching 

 

281 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

(1) Limitation on liability.– A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as 
provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by 
reason of the intermediate and temporary storage of material on a system or network controlled or 
operated by or for the service provider in a case in which – 

(A) the material is made available online by a person other than the service provider; 
(B)  the  material  is  transmitted  from  the  person  described  in  subparagraph  (A)  through  the 
system  or  network  to  a  person  other  than  the  person  described  in  subparagraph  (A)  at  the 
direction of that other person; and 
(C) the storage is carried out through an automatic technical process for the purpose of making 
the material available to users of the system or network who, after the material is transmitted 
as described in subparagraph (B), request access to the material from the person described in 
subparagraph (A),  

if the conditions set forth in paragraph (2) are met. 
[…] 

 
 
 
This  provision  is  based  on  the  Digital  Millennium  Copyright  Act  (DMCA)  which  was  signed  into  law  in 
1998.2408 By creating a safe-harbour regime, DMCA excluded the liability of providers of certain services 
for copyright violations by third parties.2409 In this context, it is first of all important to highlight that not all 
providers  are  covered  by  the  limitation.2410 The  limitation  of  liability  is  only  applicable  to  service 
providers2411 and caching providers.2412 In addition, it is important to point out that the liability is linked to 
certain requirements. With regard to service providers, the requirements are that:  

• 

• 

the transmission of the material was initiated by or at the direction of a person other than the 
service provider; 
the transmission is carried out through an automatic technical process without selection of the 
material by the service provider; 
the service provider does not select the recipients of the material; 

• 
•  no  copy  of  the  material  made  by  the  service  provider  in  the  course  of  such  intermediate  or 
transient  storage  is  maintained  on  the  system  or  network  in  a  manner  ordinarily  accessible  to 
anyone other than anticipated recipients. 

Another  example  of  a  limitation  of  the  responsibility  of  Internet  providers  can  be  found  in  47  USC. 
§ 230(c), which is based on the Communications Decency Act2413: 
 
§ 230. Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material 
[…] 
(c) Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material 
 
 

(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker 
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of 
any information provided by another information content provider. 
(2) Civil liability 
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of – 

(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that 
the  provider  or  user  considers  to  be  obscene,  lewd,  lascivious,  filthy,  excessively  violent, 
harassing,  or  otherwise  objectionable,  whether  or  not  such  material  is  constitutionally 
protected; or 
(B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the 
technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1). 
[…] 

 
 
What  both  approaches,  i.e. 17 USC.  § 512(a)  as  well  as  47  USC.  § 230(c),  have  in  common  is  that  they 
focus on liability with regard to special groups of providers and special areas of law. The remaining part of 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 

282 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
this chapter will therefore give an overview of the legislative approach adopted by the European Union, 
which follows a broader concept.  

European Union Directive on Electronic Commerce 

6.7.3 
An example of a legislative approach to regulate the liability of Internet providers is the European Union’s 
E-Commerce Directive.2414 Faced with the challenges stemming from the international dimension of the 
Internet, the drafters of the Directive decided to develop legal standards that provide a legal framework 
for  the  overall  development  of  the  information  society,  and  thereby  support  overall  economic 
development  as  well  as  the  work  of  law-enforcement  agencies. 2415 The  regulation  regarding  liability  is 
based on the principle of graduated responsibility.  
The Directive contains a number of provisions that limit the liability of certain providers.2416 The limitations 
are linked to the different categories of services operated by the provider.2417 In all other cases liability is 
not necessarily excluded, and unless liability is limited by other regulations, the actor is fully liable. The 
motivation  of  the  Directive  is  to  limit  liability  in  those  cases  where  the  provider  has  only  limited 
possibilities to prevent the crime. The reasons for the limited possibilities may be technical. The routers 
are for example – without a significant loss of speed – unable to filter the data passing through them and 
hardly able to prevent data-exchange processes. Hosting providers have the ability to remove data if they 
become aware of criminal activities. However, like the routers, the big hosting providers are unable to 
control all data stored on their servers.  
Having regard to the varying ability to actually control criminal activities, the liability of hosting and access 
providers  is  different.  In  this  respect,  it  needs  to  be  taken  into  consideration  that  the  balance  of  the 
Directive  is  based  on  current  technical  standards.  At  the  moment  no  tools  are  available  that  can 
automatically  detect  unknown  pornographic  images.  If  technical  development  continues  in  this  area  it 
could  become  necessary  to  evaluate  the  technical  ability  of  providers  in  the  future  and,  if  necessary, 
adjust the system.  

Liability of access provider (European Union Directive on Electronic Commerce) 

6.7.4 
Article 12  to 15  define  the  degree  of  the  limitation  of  liability  of  the  different  providers.  Based  on 
Article 12, the  liability  of  access  providers  and  router  operators  is  completely  excluded  as  long  as  they 
comply  with  the  three  conditions  stipulated  in  Article 12.  As  a  consequence,  the  access  provider  is  in 
general not responsible for criminal offences committed by its users. This full exclusion of liability does 
not  release  the  provider  from  the  obligation  to  prevent  further  offences  if  ordered  by  a  court  or 
administrative authority.2418  
 
Section 4: Liability of intermediary service providers  
Article 12 
“Mere conduit” 
1. Where an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication 
network  of  information  provided  by  a  recipient  of  the  service,  or  the  provision  of  access  to  a 
communication  network,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  service  provider  is  not  liable  for  the 
information transmitted, on condition that the provider: 
 
 
 
2. The acts of transmission and of provision of access referred to in paragraph 1 include the automatic, 
intermediate and transient storage of the information transmitted in so far as this takes place for the sole 
purpose  of  carrying  out  the  transmission  in  the  communication  network,  and  provided  that  the 
information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission. 
3. This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with 
Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement. 
 

(a) does not initiate the transmission; 
(b) does not select the receiver of the transmission; and 
(c) does not select or modify the information contained in the transmission. 

 

283 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
The approach is comparable to 17 USC. § 512(a).2419 Both regulations aim to specify the liability of service 
providers and both regulations link the limitation of liability to similar requirements. The main difference 
is the fact that the application of Article 12 of the EU E-Commerce Directive is not limited to copyright 
violations but excludes liability with regard to any kind of offence.  

Liability for caching (European Union Directive on Electronic Commerce) 

6.7.5 
The term “caching” is in this context used to describe the storage of popular websites on local storage 
media in order to reduce bandwidth and make access to data more efficient.2420 One technique used to 
reduce  bandwidth  is  the  installation  of  proxy  servers.2421 Within  this  scope,  a  proxy  server  may  service 
requests  without  contacting  the  specified  server  (the  domain  name  entered  by  the  user)  by  retrieving 
content saved on local storage media from a previous request. The drafters of the Directive recognized 
the economic importance of caching and decided to exclude liability for automatic temporary storage if 
the  provider  complies  with  the  conditions  stipulated  in  Article 13.  One  of  the  conditions  is  that  the 
provider complies with widely recognized standards regarding the updating of the information. 
 
Article 13 
“Caching” 
1. Where an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication 
network of information provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service 
provider  is  not  liable  for  the  automatic,  intermediate  and  temporary  storage  of  that  information, 
performed for the sole purpose of making more efficient the information’s onward transmission to other 
recipients of the service upon their request, on condition that: 
 
 
 

(a) the provider does not modify the information; 
(b) the provider complies with conditions on access to the information; 
(c)  the  provider  complies  with  rules  regarding  the  updating  of  the  information,  specified  in  a 
manner widely recognised and used by industry; 
(d) the provider does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used by 
industry, to obtain data on the use of the information; and 
(e) the provider acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information it has stored 
upon  obtaining  actual  knowledge  of  the  fact  that  the  information  at  the  initial  source  of  the 
transmission has been removed from the network, or access to it has been disabled, or that a court 
or an administrative authority has ordered such removal or disablement. 

 

 

2. This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with 
Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement. 
 
Article 13 of the European Union E-Commerce Directive is another example of similarities between the 
dogmatic  structure  of  the  US  and  European  approaches.  The  EU  approach  is  comparable  to  17  USC. 
§ 512(b).2422 Both regulations aim to specify the liability of caching providers and both regulations link the 
limitation of liability to similar requirements. With regard to the liability of service providers2423, the main 
difference  between  the  two  approaches  is  the  fact  that  the  application  of  Article 13  of  the  EU 
E-Commerce Directive is not limited to copyright violations but excludes liability with regard to any kind of 
offence. 

Liability of Hosting Provider (European Union Directive) 

6.7.6 
Especially  with  regard  to  illegal  content,  the  hosting  provider  has  an  important  function  within  the 
perpetration of the offence. Offenders who are making illegal content available online do not generally 
store them on their own servers. Most websites are stored on servers that are made available by hosting 
providers. Anyone who would like to run a webpage can rent storage capacity from a hosting provider to 
store the website. Some providers even offer ad-sponsored webspace free of charge.2424  
The identification of illegal content is a challenge for the hosting provider. Especially for popular providers 
with many websites, manual searches for illegal content on such a great number of websites would be 

284 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
impossible.  As  a  result,  the  drafters  of  the  Directive  decided  to  limit  the  liability  of  hosting  providers. 
However, unlike in the case of the access provider, the liability of the host provider is not excluded. As 
long  as  the  host  provider  has  no  actual  knowledge  of  illegal  activities  or  illegal  content  stored  on  its 
servers,  it  is  not  liable.  Here,  an  assumption  that  illegal  content  could  be  stored  on  the  servers  is  not 
considered  equivalent  to  actually  having  knowledge  of  the  matter.  If  the  provider  obtains  concrete 
knowledge about illegal activities or illegal content, it can only avoid liability if it immediately removes the 
illegal information.2425 Failure to react immediately will lead to liability of the hosting provider.2426  
 
Article 14  
Hosting 
1. Where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by 
a  recipient  of  the  service,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  service  provider  is  not  liable  for  the 
information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that: 
 

(a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards 
claims  for  damages,  is  not  aware  of  facts  or  circumstances  from  which  the  illegal  activity  or 
information is apparent; or 
(b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to 
disable access to the information. 

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply when the recipient of the service is acting under the authority or the control 
of the provider. 
3. This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with 
Member States’ legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement, 
nor does it affect the possibility for Member States of establishing procedures governing the removal or 
disabling of access to information. 
 
Article 14 is not only applicable for providers which limit their services to renting technical data-storage 
infrastructure. Popular Internet services like the auction platforms offer hosting services, too.2427 

 

Liability of hosting provider (HIPCAR) 

6.7.7 
Another approach to the liability of hosting providers can be found in the legislative text developed by the 
beneficiary states within the HIPCAR initiative.2428  
 
Hosting Provider 
30 (1) A hosting provider is not criminally liable for the information stored at the request of a user of the 
service, on condition that: 
 

(a) the hosting provider expeditiously removes or disables access to the information after receiving 
an order from any public authority or court of law to remove specific illegal information stored; or 
(b) the hosting provider, upon obtaining knowledge or awareness about specific illegal information 
stored by other ways than an order from a public authority, expeditiously informs a public authority 
to enable them to evaluate the nature of the information and if necessary issue an order to remove 
the content. 

 

(2) Paragraph 1 shall not apply when the user of the service is acting under the authority or the control of 
the hosting provider. 
(3) If the hosting provider is removing the content after receiving an order pursuant to paragraph 1 he is 
exempted from contractual obligations with his customer to ensure the availability of the service. 
 
Just  like  the  European  Union  approach,  Section  II,  Part  V,  30(1)a.  limits  liability  if  the  hosting  provider 
expeditiously removes content after receiving an order from any public authority or court. Expeditiously 
in general means within less than 24 hours.2429 The main difference from the EU approach can be found in 
Section II,  Part  V,  30(1)b.  Unlike  under  the  EU  approach,  the  provider  does  not  to  determine  whether 
content that comes to its attention is considered illegal. If it receives knowledge, its obligation is first of all 

 

285 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
limited to informing the (designated) public authority about the potentially illegal content. The drafters of 
the provision decided that it is those authorities which should determine the nature of the provision and 
issue  an  order  to  remove  the  content.2430 If  the  information  is  considered  illegal  the  provider  needs  to 
remove it to avoid liability.  

6.7.8 

Exclusion  of  the  obligation  to  monitor  (European  Union  Directive  on  Electronic 
Commerce) 

Before the Directive was implemented it was uncertain in some Member States whether the providers 
could be prosecuted based on a violation of the obligation to monitor users’ activities. Apart from possible 
conflicts with data-protection regulations and secrecy of telecommunications, such an obligation would 
especially  cause  difficulties  for  hosting  providers  which  store  thousands  of  websites.  To  avoid  these 
conflicts, the Directive excludes a general obligation to monitor transmitted or stored information.  
 
Article 15 
No general obligation to monitor 
1. Member States shall not impose a general obligation on providers, when providing the services covered 
by Articles 12, 13 and 14, to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor a general obligation 
actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity. 
2. Member States may establish obligations for information society service providers promptly to inform 
the  competent  public  authorities  of  alleged  illegal  activities  undertaken  or  information  provided  by 
recipients of their service or obligations to communicate to the competent authorities, at their request, 
information  enabling  the  identification  of  recipients  of  their  service  with  whom  they  have  storage 
agreements. 

Liability for hyperlinks (Austrian ECC) 

6.7.9 
Hyperlinks play in important role on the Internet. They enable the provider of the hyperlink to guide the 
user  to  specific  information  available  online.  Instead  of  just  offering  technical  details  on  how  the 
information can be accessed (e.g. by providing the domain name of the website where the information is 
offered), the user can directly access the information by clicking on the active hyperlink. The hyperlink 
provides the command for the web browser to open the deposited Internet address. 
During  the  drafting  of  the  European  Union  Directive,  the  need  for  a  regulation  on  hyperlinks  was 
intensively discussed.2431 The drafters decided not to oblige the Member States to harmonize their laws 
regarding liability for hyperlinks. Instead, they implemented a re-examination procedure to ensure that 
the need for proposals concerning the liability of providers of hyperlinks and location tool services was 
taken  into  consideration.2432 Until  regulation  of  liability  for  hyperlinks  is  amended  in  the  future,  the 
Member States are free to develop national solutions.2433 Some EU countries have decided to address the 
liability  of  hyperlink  providers  in  a  dedicated  provision.2434 These  countries  have  based  the  liability  of 
hyperlink providers on the same principles that the Directive provides with regard the liability of hosting 
providers.2435 This approach is the logical consequence of the comparable situation of host and hyperlink 
providers.  In  both  cases,  the  providers  are  in  control  of  the  illegal  content,  or  at  least  the  link  to  the 
content.  
An example is section 17 of the Austrian ECC:2436  
 
Sec. 17 ECC (Austria) – Liability for hyperlinks 
(1) A provider who enables the access to information provided by third person by providing an electronic 
link is not liable for the information if he 
 

1.  does  not  have  actual  knowledge  of  unlawful  activity  or  information  and,  where  a  claim  for 
damages is made, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which it would have been apparent 
to the service provider that the activity or information was unlawful; or  
2. upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove the electronic link. 

 

286 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
6.7.10  Liability of search engines 
Search-engine  providers  offer  search  services  to  identify  documents  of  interest  by  specifying  certain 
criteria. The search engine will search for relevant documents that match the criteria entered by the user. 
Search engines play an import role in the successful development of the Internet. Content that is made 
available on a website but is not listed in the search engine’s index can only be accessed if the person 
wishing  to  access  it  knows  the  complete  URL.  Introna/Nissenbaum  points  out  that  “without  much 
exaggeration one could say that to exist is to be indexed by a search engine”.2437  
As in the case of hyperlinks, the European Union Directive does not contain standards defining the liability 
of search-engine operators. Therefore, some EU countries have decided to address the liability of search-
engine providers in a dedicated provision.2438 Unlike in the case of hyperlinks, not all countries have based 
their regulation on the same principles.2439 Spain2440 and Portugal have based their regulations regarding 
the  liability  of  search-engine  operators  on  Article 14  of  the  Directive,  while  Austria2441 has  based  the 
limitation of liability on Article 12.  
 
Sec. 14 ECC (Austria) – Liability of search engine operators  
(1)  A  provider  who  makes available  a  search  engine  or  other electronic  tools  to search  for  information 
provided by third party is not liable on condition that the provider: 
 
 
 

1. does not initiate the transmission; 
2. does not select the receiver of the transmission; and  
3. does not select or modify the information contained in the transmission

1415 These range from the simple proof that technical protection measures can be circumvented, to the intent to obtain 
data stored on the victim computer. Even political motivations have been discovered. See: Anderson, Hacktivism and

1425 Art. 2 of the Convention on Cybercrime enables the Member States to keep those existing limitations that are 

mentioned in Art. 2, sentence 2. Regarding the possibility of limiting criminalization, see also: Explanatory Report to the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 40. 

1426 An example of this is the German Criminal Code, which criminalized only the act of obtaining data (Section 202a). This 

provision was changed in 2007. The following text presents the old version:  

 
 

 

Section 202a – Data Espionage  
(1) Whoever, without authorization, obtains data for himself or another, which was not intended for him and was 
specially protected against unauthorized access, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or 
a fine.  
(2) Within the meaning of subsection (1), data shall only be those which stored or transmitted electronically or 
magnetically or otherwise in a not immediately perceivable manner. 

1427 This approach is not only found in national legislation, but was also recommended by Council of Europe 

Recommendation No. (89) 9.

Factor in Phishing, available at: www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/papers/aci.pdf; Gercke, Computer und Recht 
2005, page 606. The term “phishing” describes an act that is carried out to make the victim disclose personal/secret 
information. It originally described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of Internet 
users. The use of “ph” is linked to popular hacker naming conventions. See Gercke, Computer und Recht, 2005, 
page 606; Ollmann, The Phishing Guide Understanding & Preventing Phishing Attacks, available at:

40 per cent of all respondents reported that between 1 per cent and 40 per cent of the losses related to computer and

1436 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 39. 
1437 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 39. 
1438 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that 
the conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable 
per se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self-
defence or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression 
“without right” derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may 
implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative, 
executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established 
legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law. The Convention, therefore, leaves 
unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government 
acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and 
common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices 
should not be criminalized”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38.

“phishing” describes an act that is carried out to make the victim disclose personal/secret information. It originally 
described the use of e-mails to “phish” for passwords and financial data from a sea of Internet users. The use of “ph” is 
linked to popular hacker naming conventions. See Gercke, Computer und Recht, 2005, page 606; Ollmann, The Phishing 
Guide Understanding & Preventing Phishing Attacks, available at: www.nextgenss.com/papers/NISR-WP-Phishing.pdf.

1446 Article 42 – Reservations: By a written notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, any 

State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, 
declare that it avails itself of the reservation(s) provided for in Article 4, paragraph 2, Article 6, paragraph 3, Article 9, 
paragraph 4, Article 10, paragraph 3, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 14, paragraph 3, Article 22, paragraph 2, Article 29, 
paragraph 4, and Article 41, paragraph 1. No other reservation may be made. 

1447 This limits the criminalization of illegal access to those cases where the victim used technical protection measures to 
protect its computer system. Access an unprotected computer system would therefore not be considered a criminal 
act.  

1448 The additional mental element/motivation enables Member States to undertake a more focused approach rather than 
implementing a criminalization of the mere act of hacking. See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention 
on Cybercrime, No. 47, and Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 62. 

1449 This enables Member States to avoid a criminalization of cases where the offender had physical access to the computer 

system of the victim and therefore did not need to perform an Internet-based attack.

2. Each Member State may decide that the conduct referred to in paragraph 1 is incriminated only where the offence 
is committed by infringing a security measure.

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
1456 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that 
the conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable 
per se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self 
defence or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression 
“without right” derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may 
implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative, 
executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established 
legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law. The Convention, therefore, leaves 
unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government 
acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and 
common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices 
should not be criminalized”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38. 

1457 See Sofaer/Goodman/Cuellar/Drozdova and others. A Proposal for an International Convention on Cybercrime and 

Terrorism, 2000, available at: www.iwar.org.uk/law/resources/cybercrime/stanford/cisac-draft.htm. 

1458 In this context, “computer system” means any device or a group of interconnected or related devices, one or more of 

which, pursuant to a program, performs automatic processing of data. 

1459 Standalone computer systems are covered by Art. 1, paragraph 3, of the Draft Convention because they “control 

programs”. This does not require a network connection.  

1460 The Project on Enhancing Competiveness in the Caribbean through the Harmonization of ICT Policies, Legislation and 
Regulatory Procedures (HIPCAR) is project conceived by ITU, CARICOM and CTU. Further information is available at: 
www.itu.int/ITU-D/projects/ITU_EC_ACP/hipcar/index.html.  

1461 Available at: www.itu.int/ITU-D/projects/ITU_EC_ACP/hipcar/index.html. 
1462 The Explanatory Report points out that the provision intends to criminalize violations of the right of privacy of data 

communication. See the Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 51. 

1463 See below: § 6.1.4. 
1464 See Gercke, The Convention on Cybercrime, Multimedia und Recht 2004, page 730. 
1465 One key indication of the limitation of application is the fact that the Explanatory Report compares the solution in Art. 3 

to traditional violations of the privacy of communication beyond the Internet, which do not cover any form of data 
espionage. “The offence represents the same violation of the privacy of communications as traditional tapping and 
recording of oral telephone conversations between persons. The right to privacy of correspondence is enshrined in Article 
8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.” See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime, No. 51. 

1466 See in this context especially a recent case from Hong Kong, People’s Republic of China. See above: § 2.5.2.

History of Cryptology, available at: www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/about-cse/museum.pdf. 

1469 One of the consequences related to this aspect is the fact that limitation of the criminalization of illegal access to those 
cases where the victim of the attack secured the target computer system with technical protection measures could limit 
the application of such a provision, insofar as a large number of users do not have sufficient knowledge about the 
implementation of technical protection measures.

D/projects/ITU_EC_ACP/hipcar/index.html. 

1478 This provision has recently been modified and now even criminalizes illegal access to data. The previous version of the 

provision has been used here, because it is better suited for demonstrating the dogmatic structure.  

1479 See Hoyer in SK-StGB, Sec. 202a, Nr. 3.  
1480 A similar approach of limiting criminalization to cases where the victim did not take preventive measures can be found 

in Art. 2, sentence 2, Convention on Cybercrime: A Party may require that the offence be committed by infringing 
security measures, with the intent of obtaining computer data or other dishonest intent, or in relation to a computer 
system that is connected to another computer system. For more information, see above: § 6.1.1.  

1481 This provision is therefore an example for of a legislative approach that should not substitute for, but rather 

complement, self-protection measures.

listening to, monitoring or surveillance of the content of communications, to the procuring of the content of data either 
directly, through access and use of the computer system, or indirectly, through the use of electronic eavesdropping or 
tapping devices. Interception may also involve recording. Technical means includes technical devices fixed to 
transmission lines as well as devices to collect and record wireless communications. They may include the use of 
software, passwords and codes. The requirement of using technical means is a restrictive qualification to avoid over-
criminalization.” Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 53. 

1496 Within this context, only interceptions made by technical means are covered by the provision – Article 3 does not cover 

acts of “social engineering”.

1517 The 2007 Computer Economics Malware Report focuses on computer crime and analyses the impact of malware on the 
worldwide economy by summing up the estimated costs caused by attacks. It identified peaks in 2000 (USD 17.1 billion) 
and 2004 (USD 17.5 billion). For more information, see: 2007 Malware Report: The Economic Impact of Viruses, 
Spyware, Adware, Botnets, and Other malicious Code. A summary of the report is available at: 
www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225. 

1518 A number of computer fraud scams are including the manipulation of data – e.g. the manipulation of bank-account files, 

transfer records or data on smart cards. Regarding computer related fraud scams, see above: § 2.8.1 and below: § 
6.1.17. 

1519 Regarding the problems related to these gaps, see for example the LOVEBUG case, where a designer of a computer 

worm could not be prosecuted due to the lack of criminal law provisions related to data interference. See above: § 2.5.4 
and: CNN, Love Bug virus raises spectre of cyberterrorism, 08.05.2000,

1520 A similar approach to Art. 4 of the Convention on Cybercrime is found in the EU Framework Decision on Attacks against 

Information Systems: Article 4 – Illegal data interference: “Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to 
ensure that the intentional deletion, damaging, deterioration, alteration, suppression or rendering inaccessible of 
computer data on an information system is punishable as a criminal offence when committed without right, at least for 
cases which are not minor”.

1535 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report states: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that the 
conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable per 
se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self defence 
or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression “without 
right” derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may implement the 
concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative, executive, 
administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established legal 
defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law. The Convention, therefore, leaves unaffected 
conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government acts to 
maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and common 
activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices should not be 
criminalized”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38. 

1536 See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 62: “The modification of traffic data for 

the purpose of facilitating anonymous communications (e.g., the activities of anonymous remailer systems), or the 
modification of data for the purpose of secure communications (e.g., encryption), should in principle be considered a 
legitimate protection of privacy and, therefore, be considered as being undertaken with right.” Regarding the liability of 
Remailer, see: Du Pont, The time has come for limited liability for operators of true Anonymity Remails in Cyberspace:

1538 With regard to the possible difficulties to identify offenders who have made use of anonymous or encrypted 

information, the Convention leaves the criminalization of anonymous communications open to the parties to decide on

1551 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 66. 
1552 The Explanatory Report gives examples for implementation of restrictive criteria for serious hindering: “Each Party shall 
determine for itself what criteria must be fulfilled in order for the hindering to be considered “serious.” For example, a 
Party may require a minimum amount of damage to be caused in order for the hindering to be considered serious. The 
drafters considered as “serious” the sending of data to a particular system in such a form, size or frequency that it has a 
significant detrimental effect on the ability of the owner or operator to use the system, or to communicate with other 
systems (e.g. by means of programs that generate “denial-of-service” attacks, malicious codes such as viruses that 
prevent or substantially slow the operation of the system, or programs that send huge quantities of electronic mail to a 
recipient in order to block the communications functions of the system)” – See Explanatory Report to the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 67.

the connotation of “serious” does limit the applicability, it is likely that even serious delays to operations resulting from 
attacks against a computer system can be covered by the provision.

or operator, or the reconfiguration of a computer’s operating system that takes place when the operator of a system 
installs new software that disables similar, previously installed programs. Therefore, such conduct is not criminalized by 
this article, even if it causes serious hindering.”

1583 Dual criminality exists if the offence is a crime under both the requested and requesting party’s laws. The difficulties the 

dual criminality principle can cause within international investigations are a current issue in a number of international

1620 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that 
the conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable 
per se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self 
defence or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression 
‘without right’ derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may 
implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative, 
executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established 
legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law. The Convention, therefore, leaves 
unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government 
acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and 
common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices 
should not be criminalised”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38.

1627   Official Notes: 
 

NOTE: The laws respecting pornography vary considerably throughout the Commonwealth. For this reason, the 
prohibition in the model law is limited to child pornography, which is generally the subject of an absolute prohibition 
in all member countries. However a country may wish to extend the application of this prohibition to other forms of 
pornography, as the concept may be defined under domestic law. 
NOTE: The pecuniary penalty will apply to a corporation but the amount of the fine may be insufficient. If it is desired 
to provide a greater penalty for corporations, the last few lines of subsection (1) could read: “commits an offence 
punishable, on conviction: 
(a) in the case of an individual, by a fine not exceeding [amount] or imprisonment for a period not exceeding [period]; 
or 
(b) in the case of a corporation, by a fine not exceeding [a greater amount]. 

 

 

 
1628 Official Note: 
 

NOTE: Countries may wish to reduce or expand upon the available defences set out in paragraph 2, depending on the 
particular context within the jurisdiction. However, care should be taken to keep the defences to a minimum and to 
avoid overly broad language that could be used to justify offences in unacceptable factual situations.

committee drafting the Convention discussed the possibility of including other content-related offences, such as the 
distribution of racist propaganda through computer systems. However, the committee was not in a position to reach 
consensus on the criminalisation of such conduct. While there was significant support in favour of including this as a 
criminal offence, some delegations expressed strong concern about including such a provision on freedom of expression 
grounds. Noting the complexity of the issue, it was decided that the committee would refer to the European Committee 
on Crime Problems (CDPC) the issue of drawing up an additional Protocol to the Convention.”

1674 Dual criminality exists if the offence is a crime under both the requested and requesting party’s laws. The difficulties the 

dual criminality principle can cause within international investigations are a current issue in a number of international 
conventions and treaties. Examples include Art. 2 of the EU Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European 
arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JHA). Regarding the dual criminality 
principle in international investigations, see: United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-
Related Crime, 269, available at www.uncjin.org/Documents/EighthCongress.html; Schjolberg/Hubbard, Harmonizing 
National Legal Approaches on Cybercrime, 2005, page 5, available at:

1680 See the decision from the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH), published in BGHST 11, page 209.  
1681 See Thumm, Strafbarkeit des Anbietens von Internetgluecksspielen gemaess § 284 StGB, 2004.  
1682 Examples of equipment in Internet-related cases could include servers, as well as Internet connections. Internet service 
providers which do not know that their services are abused by offenders to run illegal gambling operations are thus not 
responsible, as they may lack intention. 

1683 For details, see: Hoyer, SK-StGB, Sec. 284, Nr. 18. As mentioned previously, criminalization is limited to those cases 

where the offender is intentionally making the equipment available. 
1684 This is especially relevant with regard to the location of the server.  
1685 Avoiding the creation of safe havens is a major intention of harmonization processes. The issue of safe havens has been 

addressed by a number of international organizations. UN General Assembly Resolution 55/63 states that: “States 
should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information 
technologies”. The full text of the resolution is available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/a_res_55/res5563e.pdf. The G8 
10 Point Action plan highlights: “There must be no safe havens for those who abuse information technologies”. 

1686 With regard to the principle of sovereignty, changing the location of a server can have a great impact on the ability of 

law-enforcement agencies to carry out an investigation. National Sovereignty is a fundamental principle in International 
Law. See: Roth, State Sovereignty, International Legality, and Moral Disagreement, 2005, page 1, available at: 
www.law.uga.edu/intl/roth.pdf.

1714 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 69: “The sending of unsolicited e-mail, for 
commercial or other purposes, may cause nuisance to its recipient, in particular when such messages are sent in large 
quantities or with a high frequency (“spamming”). In the opinion of the drafters, such conduct should only be 
criminalised where the communication is intentionally and seriously hindered. Nevertheless, Parties may have a 
different approach to hindrance under their law, e.g. by making particular acts of interference administrative offences 
or otherwise subject to sanction. The text leaves it to the Parties to determine the extent to which the functioning of 
the system should be hindered – partially or totally, temporarily or permanently – to reach the threshold of harm that 
justifies sanction, administrative or criminal, under their law.”

1726 One example of this misuse is the publication of passwords used for access control. Once published, a single password 

can grant access to restricted information to hundreds of users. 

1727 One example is the 2001 EU Framework Decision combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment.  
1728 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 71: “To combat such dangers more 

effectively, the criminal law should prohibit specific potentially dangerous acts at the source, preceding the commission 
of offences under Articles 2 – 5. In this respect the provision builds upon recent developments inside the Council of 
Europe (European Convention on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access – ETS N° 
178) and the European Union (Directive 98/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 1998 
on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access) and relevant provisions in some 
countries”. 

1729 With the definition of “distributing” in the Explanatory Report (‘Distribution’ refers to the active act of forwarding data 

to others – Explanatory Report, No. 72), the drafters of the Convention restrict devices to software. Although the 
Explanatory Report is not definitive in this matter, it is likely that it covers not only software devices, but hardware tools 
as well.

(4) knowingly, and with intent to defraud, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses device-making 
equipment; 
(5) knowingly and with intent to defraud effects transactions, with 1 or more access devices issued to another person 
or persons, to receive payment or any other thing of value during any 1-year period the aggregate value of which is 
equal to or greater than $1,000; 
(6) without the authorization of the issuer of the access device, knowingly and with intent to defraud solicits a person 
for the purpose of - 
(A) offering an access device; or 
(B) selling information regarding or an application to obtain an access device; 
(7) knowingly and with intent to defraud uses, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses a

(b) 
(1) Whoever attempts to commit an offense under subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to the same penalties

1734 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 72.  
1735 This approach could lead to broad criminalization. Therefore Art. 6, Subparagraph 3 of the Convention on Cybercrime

1737 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 72. 
1738 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 72: “This term also intends to cover the 

creation or compilation of hyperlinks in order to facilitate access to such devices”.

aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. 

1740 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 73: The drafters debated at length whether 
the devices should be restricted to those which are designed exclusively or specifically for committing offences, thereby 
excluding dual-use devices. This was considered to be too narrow. It could lead to insurmountable difficulties of proof in 
criminal proceedings, rendering the provision practically inapplicable or only applicable in rare instances. The 
alternative to include all devices even if they are legally produced and distributed, was also rejected. Only the subjective 
element of the intent of committing a computer offence would then be decisive for imposing a punishment, an 
approach which in the area of money counterfeiting also has not been adopted. As a reasonable compromise the 
Convention restricts its scope to cases where the devices are objectively designed, or adapted, primarily for the purpose 
of committing an offence. This alone will usually exclude dual-use devices. 

1741   Regarding the US approach to address the issue, see for example 18 USC. § 2512 (2): 
 
 

(2) It shall not be unlawful under this section for –  
(a) a provider of wire or electronic communication service or an officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under 
contract with, such a provider, in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or electronic communication 
service, or 
(b) an officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under contract with, the United States, a State, or a political 
subdivision thereof, in the normal course of the activities of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision 
thereof, to send through the mail, send or carry in interstate or foreign commerce, or manufacture, assemble, possess, 
or sell any electronic, mechanical, or other device knowing or having reason to know that the design of such device 
renders it primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.

1743 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 76: “Paragraph 2 sets out clearly that those 

tools created for the authorised testing or the protection of a computer system are not covered by the provision. This 
concept is already contained in the expression ‘without right’. For example, test-devices (‘cracking-devices’) and 
network analysis devices designed by industry to control the reliability of their information technology products or to 
test system security are produced for legitimate purposes, and would be considered to be ‘with right’.”

1747 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 76. 
1748 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report points out: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that 
the conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable 
per se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self 
defence or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression 
‘without right’ derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may 
implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative, 
executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established 
legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law. The Convention, therefore, leaves 
unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government 
acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and 
common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices 
should not be criminalised”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38.

Paragraph 3:  
A person who possesses more than one item mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii), is deemed to possess the item with 
the intent that it be used by any person for the purpose of committing an offence against section 5, 6,7 or 8 unless 
the contrary is proven. 
Official Note: Subsection 3 is an optional provision. For some countries such a presumption may prove very useful 
while for others, it may not add much value, in the context of this particular offence. Countries need to consider 
whether the addition would be useful within the particular legal context.

(3) Where a person possesses more than [number to be inserted] item(s) mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii), a court 
may infer that the person possesses the item with the intent that it be used by any person for the purpose of

a parallel offence to the forgery of tangible documents. It aims at filling gaps in criminal law related to traditional 
forgery, which requires visual readability of statements, or declarations embodied in a document and which does not 
apply to electronically stored data. Manipulations of such data with evidentiary value may have the same serious 
consequences as traditional acts of forgery if a third party is thereby misled. Computer-related forgery involves 
unauthorised creating or altering stored data so that they acquire a different evidentiary value in the course of legal 
transactions, which relies on the authenticity of information contained in the data, is subject to a deception.”

1789 This is not the case if the scam is based solely on synthetic data. Regarding the relevance of synthetic data, see:

www.idanalytics.com/assets/pdf/National_Fraud_Ring_Analysis_Overview.pdf.  

1790 The reason for the success is the fact that the provisions focus on the most relevant aspect of phase 1: transfer of the 

information from the victim to the offender. 

1791 Examples of acts that are not covered include the illegal access to a computer system in order to obtain identity related 

information. 

1792 One of the most common ways the information obtained is used is fraud. See: Consumer Fraud and Identity Theft 

Complain Data, January – December 2005, Federal Trade Commission, 2006, page 3, available at: 
www.consumer.gov/sentinel/pubs/Top10Fraud2005.pdf.  

1793 Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the provisions criminalize possession if the offender does not intend to use the 

data but to sell them. Prosecution could in this case in general be based on fact that 18 USC. § 1028 not only 
criminalizes possession with the intent to use it to commit a crime, but also to aid or abet any unlawful activity.

1805 One example of this is Section 263 of the German Penal Code that requires the falsity of a person (mistake). The 

provision does not therefore cover the majority of computer-related fraud cases:  

 
 

Section 263 Fraud  
(1) Whoever, with the intent of obtaining for himself or a third person an unlawful material benefit, damages the 
assets of another, by provoking or affirming a mistake by pretending that false facts exist or by distorting or 
suppressing true facts, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine. 

1806 A national approach that is explicitly address computer-related fraud is 18 USC. § 1030: 
 
 
 

Sec. 1030. Fraud and related activity in connection with computers 
(a) Whoever - 
(1) having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and by means of 
such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an 
Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or 
foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States, or to the 
advantage of any foreign nation willfully communicates, delivers, transmits, or causes to be communicated, delivered, 
or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted 
the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or 
employee of the United States entitled to receive it; 
(2) intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains - 
(A) information contained in a financial record of a financial institution, or of a card issuer as defined in section 
1602(n) of title 15, or contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency on a consumer, as such terms are defined in 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 USC. 1681 et seq.); 
(B) information from any department or agency of the United States; or 
(C) information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication; 
(3) intentionally, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer of a department or agency of the United 
States, accesses such a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the 
United States or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, is used by or for the Government of the United 
States and such conduct affects that use by or for the Government of the United States; 
(4) knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized 
access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of 
the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than 
$5,000 in any 1-year period; 

 
 

 
 
 

 

1807 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 86.  
1808 The drafters highlighted that the four elements have the same meaning as in the previous articles: “To ensure that all 

possible relevant manipulations are covered, the constituent elements of ‘input’, ‘alteration’, ‘deletion’ or ‘suppression’ 
in Article 8(a) are supplemented by the general act of ‘interference with the functioning of a computer program or 
system’ in Article 8(b). The elements of ‘input, alteration, deletion or suppression’ have the same meaning as in the 
previous articles.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 86.

1810 With regard to the definition of “alteration” in Art. 4, see Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on 

Cybercrime, No. 61. 

1811 With regard to the definition of “suppression” in Art. 4, see Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on 

Cybercrime, No. 61. 

1812 With regard to the definition of “deletion”, see Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 

No. 61. 

1813 As a result, not only data-related offences, but also hardware manipulations, are covered by the provision. 
1814 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 87. 
1815 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 88. 
1816 “The offence has to be committed “intentionally”. The general intent element refers to the computer manipulation or 

interference causing loss of property to another. The offence also requires a specific fraudulent or other dishonest 
intent to gain an economic or other benefit for oneself or another.” 

1817 The drafters of the Convention point out that these acts are not meant to be included in the offence established by 

Article 8 – Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 90. 

1818 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report notes that: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that 
the conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable 
per se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self 
defence or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression 
‘without right’ derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may 
implement the concept in their domestic law, it may refer to conduct undertaken without authority (whether legislative, 
executive, administrative, judicial, contractual or consensual) or conduct that is otherwise not covered by established 
legal defences, excuses, justifications or relevant principles under domestic law. The Convention, therefore, leaves 
unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority (for example, where the Party’s government 
acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and 
common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices 
should not be criminalised”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38.

1823 For more information on the effects of digitization on the entertainment industry, see above: § 2.7.1. 
1824 The technology that is used is called digital rights management – DRM. The term digital rights management (DRM) is 

used to describe several technologies used to enforce pre-defined policies controlling access to software, music, movies 
or other digital data. One of the key functions is copy protection, which aims to control or restrict the use and access to 
digital media content on electronic devices with such technologies installed. For further information, see:

1829 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 109. 
1830 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 110: “With regard to paragraph 1, the 
agreements referred to are the Paris Act of 24 July 1971 of the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and 
Artistic Works, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the World 
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Copyright Treaty. With regard to paragraph 2, the international instruments 
cited are the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting 
Organisations (Rome Convention), the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and 
the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The use of the term 
“pursuant to the obligations it has undertaken” in both paragraphs makes it clear that a Contracting Party to the current 
Convention is not bound to apply agreements cited to which it is not a Party; moreover, if a Party has made a 
reservation or declaration permitted under one of the agreements, that reservation may limit the extent of its 
obligation under the present Convention.” 

1831 See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 111: “The use of the term “pursuant to 
the obligations it has undertaken” in both paragraphs makes it clear that a Contracting Party to the current Convention 
is not bound to apply agreements cited to which it is not a Party; moreover, if a Party has made a reservation or 
declaration permitted under one of the agreements, that reservation may limit the extent of its obligation under the 
present Convention.”  

1832 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Nos. 16 and 108. 
1833 Article 61: 
 

Members shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark 
counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. Remedies available shall include imprisonment and/or 
monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent, consistently with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a 
corresponding gravity. In appropriate cases, remedies available shall also include the seizure, forfeiture and 
destruction of the infringing goods and of any materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the 
commission of the offence. Members may provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in other cases of 
infringement of intellectual property rights, in particular where they are committed wilfully and on a commercial scale. 

1834 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 113. 
1835 Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 114. 
1836 The element “without right” is a common component in the substantive criminal law provisions of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The Explanatory Report points out: “A specificity of the offences included is the express requirement that 
the conduct involved is done “without right”. It reflects the insight that the conduct described is not always punishable 
per se, but may be legal or justified not only in cases where classical legal defences are applicable, like consent, self 
defence or necessity, but where other principles or interests lead to the exclusion of criminal liability. The expression 
‘without right’ derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. Thus, without restricting how Parties may

acts to maintain public order, protect national security or investigate criminal offences). Furthermore, legitimate and 
common activities inherent in the design of networks, or legitimate and common operating or commercial practices 
should not be criminalised”. See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 38. 

1837 See Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 115. In addition, the drafters pointed 

out: The absence of the term “without right” does not a contrario exclude application of criminal law defences, 
justifications and principles governing the exclusion of criminal liability associated with the term “without right” 
elsewhere in the Convention.

of a criminal offence” (Art. 14).

2026 See above: §§ 4.5.4 and 6.1. 
2027 This was also highlighted by the drafters of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which contains a set of 
essential investigation instruments. The drafters of the report point out: “Not only must substantive criminal law keep 
abreast of these new abuses, but so must criminal procedural law and investigative techniques”, see: Explanatory 
Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 132. Regarding the substantive criminal law provisions 
related to cybercrime, see above: § 6.1.  

2028 Regarding the elements of an anti-cybercrime strategy, see above: § 4. Regarding user-based approaches in the fight 

against cybercrime, see: Görling, The Myth Of User Education, 2006, at www.parasite-
economy.com/texts/StefanGorlingVB2006.pdf. See also the comment made by Jean-Pierre Chevenement, French 
Minister of Interior, at the G8 Conference in Paris in 2000: “More broadly, we have to educate users. They must all 
understand what they can and can’t do on the Internet and be warned of the potential dangers. As use of the Internet 
grows, we’ll naturally have to step up our efforts in this respect.” 

2029 Due to the protocols used in Internet communication and worldwide accessibility, there is very little need for a physical 

presence at the place where a service is physically offered. Due to this independence of place of action and the crime 
site, many criminal offences related to the Internet are transnational crimes. Regarding the independence of place of 
action and the result of the offence, see above: § 3.2.7.  

2030 Regarding the challenges of fighting cybercrime, see above: § 3.2. 
2031 The pure fact that the offender is acting from a different country can result in additional challenges for law-

enforcement agencies’ investigations even if similar substantive criminal law provisions and procedural law instruments 
are in place in both countries. In these cases, the investigation nevertheless requires international cooperation between 
the authorities in both countries, which in general is more time consuming compared to investigations concentrating on 
a single country.  

2032 See in this context also: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 134. 
2033 For an overview of the current status of the implementation of the Convention on Cybercrime and its procedural law 

provisions in selected countries, see the country profiles made available on the Council of Europe website:

2123   Regarding the possibilities of making reservations, see Article 42 of the Convention on Cybercrime:  
 
 

Article 42 
By a written notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, any State may, at the time of 
signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, declare that it avails 
itself of the reservation(s) provided for in Article 4, paragraph 2, Article 6, paragraph 3, Article 9, paragraph 4, Article 
10, paragraph 3, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 14, paragraph 3, Article 22, paragraph 2, Article 29, paragraph 4, and 
Article 41, paragraph 1. No other reservation may be made. 

2124 See above: § 5.2.1. 
2125 “Although Parties are obligated to introduce certain procedural law provisions into their domestic law, the modalities of 
establishing and implementing these powers and procedures into their legal system, and the application of the powers 
and procedures in specific cases, are left to the domestic law and procedures of each Party. These domestic laws and 
procedures, as more specifically described below, shall include conditions or safeguards, which may be provided 
constitutionally, legislatively, judicially or otherwise. The modalities should include the addition of certain elements as 
conditions or safeguards that balance the requirements of law enforcement with the protection of human rights and 
liberties. As the Convention applies to Parties of many different legal systems and cultures, it is not possible to specify in 
detail the applicable conditions and safeguards for each power or procedure.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 145. 

2126 “There are some common standards or minimum safeguards to which Parties to the Convention must adhere. These 

include standards or minimum safeguards arising pursuant to obligations that a Party has undertaken under applicable 
international human rights instruments.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 
No. 145. 

2127 For the transformation of safeguards for Internet-related investigation techniques, see: Taylor, The Scope of 

Government Access to Copies of Electronic Communication Stored with Internet Service Providers: A Review of Legal 
Standards, Journal of Technology Law and Policy, Vol. 6, Issue 2, available at: 
http://grove.ufl.edu/~techlaw/vol6/issue2/taylor.pdf.  

2128 This is especially relevant with regard to the protection of the suspect of an investigation. 
2129   See: Article 37 – Accession to the Convention. 
 

1. After the entry into force of this Convention, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, after consulting 
with and obtaining the unanimous consent of the Contracting States to the Convention, may invite any State which is 
not a member of the Council and which has not participated in its elaboration to accede to this Convention. The 
decision shall be taken by the majority provided for in Article 20.d. of the Statute of the Council of Europe and by the 
unanimous vote of the representatives of the Contracting States entitled to sit on the Committee of Ministers.  

2130 ABA International Guide to Combating Cybercrime, page 139.  
2131 “Interception of telephone conversations represent[s] a serious interference with private life and correspondence and 

must accordingly be based upon a “law” that is particularly precise. It is essential to have clear, detailed rules on the 
subject, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated” – Case of Kruslin v. 
France, Application No. 11801/85. 

2132 “The requirements of the Convention, notably in regard to foreseeability, cannot be exactly the same in the special 

context of interception of communications for the purposes of police investigations as they are where the object of the 
relevant law is to place restrictions on the conduct of individuals. In particular, the requirement of foreseeability cannot 
mean that an individual should be enabled to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so 
that he can adapt his conduct accordingly”, Case of Malone v. United Kingdom, Application No. 8691/79. 

2133 “Powers of secret surveillance of citizens, characterizing as they do the police state, are tolerable under the Convention 

only insofar as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions”, Case of Klass and others v. Germany, 
Application No. 5029/71.  

2134 “The expression “in accordance with the law”, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 (Art. 8-2), requires firstly that the 
impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law”, Case of Kruslin v. France, Application No. 11801/85. 

2135 “Furthermore, tapping and other forms of interception of telephone conversations constitute a serious interference 

with private life and correspondence and must accordingly be based on a ‘law’ that is particularly precise. It is essential 
to have clear, detailed rules on the subject”, Case of Doerga v. The Netherlands, Application No. 50210/99.  

 

 

335 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
2136   “It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, 

who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law”, Case of Kruslin 
v. France, Application No. 11801/85.  
“Nevertheless, the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the 
circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and 
potentially dangerous interference with the right to respect for private life and correspondence.” Case of Malone v. 
United Kingdom, Application No. 8691/79. 

 

 

2137 “The cardinal issue arising under Article 8 (Art. 8) in the present case is whether the interference so found is justified by 

the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article (Art. 8-2). This paragraph, since it provides for an exception to a right 
guaranteed by the Convention, is to be narrowly interpreted. Powers of secret surveillance of citizens, characterizing as 
they do the police state, are tolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the 
democratic institutions”, Case of Klass and others v. Germany, Application No. 5029/71. 

2138 “Proportionality shall be implemented by each Party in accordance with relevant principles of its domestic law. For 

European countries, this will be derived from the principles of the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection 
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, its applicable jurisprudence and national legislation and jurisprudence, 
that the power or procedure shall be proportional to the nature and circumstances of the offence. Other States will 
apply related principles of their law, such as limitations on overbreadth of production orders and reasonableness 
requirements for searches and seizures.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 
No. 146. 

2139 The list is not concluding. See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 146. 
2140 “National legislatures will have to determine, in applying binding international obligations and established domestic 

principles, which of the powers and procedures are sufficiently intrusive in nature to require implementation of 
particular conditions and safeguards.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 
No. 147. 

2141 See below: § 6.2.9 
2142 See below: § 6.2.10.  
2143   “Also, the explicit limitation in Article 21 that the obligations regarding interception measures are with respect to a 

range of serious offences, determined by domestic law, is an explicit example of the application of the proportionality 
principle.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 146. 
“Due to the higher privacy interest associated with content data, the investigative measure is restricted to ‘a range of 
serious offences to be determined by domestic law’.” See: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime, No. 230. 

2144 See below: § 6.3.4.  
2145 See below: § 6.3.7.  
2146 As explained in more detail below, Art. 16 does not oblige the provider to transfer the relevant data to the authorities. 

It only authorizes the law-enforcement agencies to prevent the deletion of the relevant data. The advantage of 
separation of the obligation to preserve the data and the obligation to disclose them is the fact that it is possible to 
require different conditions for their application. 

2147 A definition of the term “subscriber information” is provided in Art. 18 Subparagraph 3 of the Convention on 

Cybercrime.  

2148 A definition of the term “computer data” is provided in Art. 1 of the Convention on Cybercrime. 
2149 As described more in detail below, the differentiation between “computer data” and “subscriber information” in Art. 18 

of the Convention on Cybercrime enables the signatory states to develop graded safeguards with regard to the 
production order. 

2150 “Determining the source or destination of these past communications can assist in identifying the identity of the 
perpetrators. In order to trace these communications so as to determine their source or destination, traffic data 
regarding these past communications is required”, see: Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime, No. 155. Regarding the identification of suspects by IP-based investigations, see: Gercke, Preservation of 
User Data, DUD 2002, page 577 et seq.

2152 The cost issue was especially raised within the discussion on data retention legislation in the EU. See, for example: 
E-communications service providers remain seriously concerned with the agreement reached by European Union 
Justice Ministers to store records of every e-mail, phone call, fax and text message, Euroispa press release, 2005, 
available at: www.ispai.ie/EUROISPADR.pdf; See as well: ABA International Guide to Combating Cybercrime, page 59.

2154 The discussion already took place at the beginning of 2000. In a G8 Meeting in Tokyo experts discussed the advantages 

and disadvantages of data retention and data preservation. The experts expressed their concerns regarding 
implementation of a data retention obligation. “Given the complexity of the above noted issues blanket solutions to 
data retention will likely not be feasible.” Report of the Workshop on Potential Consequences for Data Retention of 
Various Business Models Characterizing Internet Service Providers, G8 Government-Industry Workshop on Safety And 
Security in Cyberspace Tokyo, May 2001. A similar discussion took place during the negotiation of the Convention on 
Cybercrime. The drafters explicitly pointed out that the Convention does not establish a data retention obligation. See

Member States shall ensure that the categories of data specified in Article 5 are retained for periods of not less than 
six months and not more than two years from the date of the communication.

2157 See: Preface 11 of the European Union Data Retention Directive: “Given the importance of traffic and location data for 

the investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences, as demonstrated by research and the practical 
experience of several Member States, there is a need to ensure at European level that data that are generated or 
processed, in the course of the supply of communications services, by providers of publicly available electronic 
communications services or of a public communications network are retained for a certain period, subject to the 
conditions provided for in this Directive.”

2160 See Gercke, The Convention on Cybercrime, Multimedia und Recht 2004, page 802.  
2161 However, it is recommended that states consider the establishment of powers and procedures to actually order the 

recipient of the order to preserve the data, as quick action by this person can result in the more expeditious 
implementation of the preservation measures in particular cases. Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime,

2164 “Preservation” requires that data which already exists in a stored form be protected from anything that would cause its 

current quality or condition to change or deteriorate. Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 159. 

2165 Explanatory Report, No. 152. 
2166 Regarding the advantages of a system of graded safeguards, see above: § 6.3.3. 
2167 “The reference to ‘order or similarly obtain’ is intended to allow the use of other legal methods of achieving 

preservation than merely by means of a judicial or administrative order or directive (e.g. from police or prosecutor)”. 
See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 160. 

2168 The drafters of the Convention on Cybercrime tried to approach the problems related to the need for immediate action 
from law-enforcement agencies on the one hand and the importance of ensuring safeguards on the other in a number 
of ways. Another example for the approach is related to the production order (Art. 18). The drafters suggested that the 
requirements for the handout of data to law-enforcement agencies could be adjusted in relation to the categories of 
data. See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 174: “The conditions and safeguards referred to in 
paragraph 2 of the article, depending on the domestic law of each Party, may exclude privileged data or information. A 
Party may wish to prescribe different terms, different competent authorities and different safeguards concerning the 
submission of particular types of computer data or subscriber information held by particular categories of persons or 
service providers. For example, with respect to some types of data, such as publicly available subscriber information, a 
Party might permit law enforcement agents to issue such an order where in other situations a court order could be 
required. On the other hand, in some situations a Party might require, or be mandated by human rights safeguards to 
require that a production order be issued only by judicial authorities in order to be able to obtain certain types of data. 
Parties may wish to limit the disclosure of this data for law enforcement purposes to situations where a production 
order to disclose such information has been issued by judicial authorities. The proportionality principle also provides 
some flexibility in relation to the application of the measure, for instance in many States in order to exclude its 
application in minor cases.” 

2169 Gercke, Cybercrime Training for Judges, 2009, page 64, available at:

2170 An IP address does not necessary immediately identify the offender. If law-enforcement agencies know the IP address 
an offender used to commit an offence, this information only enables them to identify the connection used to log on to 
the Internet. If a group of people had access to this connection (e.g. in an Internet café), further investigations are 
necessary to identify the offender.  

2171 If the offender is using services that do not require a registration or if the subscriber information provided by the user is 

not verified, Art. 18 Subparagraph 1b) will not enable the law-enforcement agencies to immediately identify the 
offender. Art. 18 Subparagraph 1b) is therefore especially relevant with regard to commercial services (like providing 
Internet access, commercial e-mail or hosting services).  

2172 Gercke, The Convention on Cybercrime, Multimedia und Recht 2004, page 802. 
2173 “Often, however, no single service provider possesses enough of the crucial traffic data to be able to determine the 
actual source or destination of the communication. Each possesses one part of the puzzle, and each of these parts 
needs to be examined in order to identify the source or destination.” See Explanatory Report to the Convention on 
Cybercrime, No. 167.

2175   Official Note: As noted in the expert group report, in some countries it may be necessary to apply the same standard 
for production orders as is used for a search warrant because of the nature of the material that may be produced. In 
other countries it may be sufficient to employ a lower standard because the production process is less invasive than 
the search process. 

 

338 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 
 

Official Note: Countries may wish to consider whether subparagraph c is appropriate for inclusion in domestic law 
because while it may be of great practical use, it requires the processing and compilation of data by court order, 
which may not be suitable for some jurisdictions. 

2176 The Commonwealth Model Law contains an alternative provision:  
 

“Sec. 16: If a magistrate is satisfied on the basis of an ex parte application by a police officer that specified data stored 
in a computer system is reasonably required for the purpose of a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings, the 
magistrate may order that a person in control of the computer system disclose sufficient traffic data about a specified 
communication to identify: 
(a) the service providers; and 
(b) the path through which the communication was transmitted.”

2186 An example of an approach to restrict the use of public terminals to commit criminal offences is Art. 7 of Italian Decree-
Law No. 144. The provision forces anybody who intends to offer public Internet access (e.g. Internet cafes) to apply for 
an authorization. In addition, he is obliged to request identification from his customers prior to the use of his services.

2194 See below: § 6.3.12. 
2195 Apart from the fact that direct access enables the law-enforcement agencies to examine the physical condition of 

storage media, physical access to a computer system is the only way to ensure that the files on the suspect’s computer 
are not modified during the investigation. Regarding the importance of protecting the integrity of the examined 
computer system, see: Meyers/Rogers, Computer Forensics: The Need for Standardization and Certification, page 6,

2196 See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 184. 
2197 “However, in a number of jurisdictions stored computer data per se will not be considered as a tangible object and 
therefore cannot be secured on behalf of criminal investigations and proceedings in a parallel manner as tangible 
objects, other than by securing the data medium upon which it is stored. The aim of Article 19 of this Convention is to 
establish an equivalent power relating to stored data.” Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 184.

Vol. 119, page 531 et seq. 

2202 “However, with respect to the search of computer data, additional procedural provisions are necessary in order to 

ensure that computer data can be obtained in a manner that is equally effective as a search and seizure of a tangible 
data carrier. There are several reasons for this: first, the data is in intangible form, such as in an electromagnetic form. 
Second, while the data may be read with the use of computer equipment, it cannot be seized and taken away in the 
same sense as can a paper record.” Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 187.

2204 Kerr, Searches and Seizures in a digital world, Harvard Law Review, 2005, Vol. 119, page 531 et seq. 
2205 The importance of being able to extend the search to connected computer systems was already addressed by Council of 

Europe Recommendation No. R (95) 13 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States concerning problems of 

 

340 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

criminal procedural law connected with information technology that was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 
11.09.1995 at the 543rd meeting of the Ministers Deputies. The text of the recommendation is available at: 
www.coe.int/t/e/legal_affairs/legal_co-operation/combating_economic_crime/1_standard_settings/Rec_1995_13.pdf.  

2206 In this context, it is important to keep in mind the principle of national sovereignty. If the information is stored on a 

computer system outside the territory, an extension of the search order could violate this principle. The drafters of the 
Convention on Cybercrime therefore pointed out: “Paragraph 2 allows the investigating authorities to extend their 
search or similar access to another computer system or part of it if they have grounds to believe that the data required 
is stored in that other computer system. The other computer system or part of it must, however, also be in its 
territory”– Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 193. With regard to this issue, see also: New 
Jersey Computer Evidence Search and Seizure Manual, 2000, page 12, available at: 
www.state.nj.us/lps/dcj/pdfs/cmpmanfi.pdf.  

2207 For guidelines how to carry out the seizure of computer equipment, see for example: General Guidelines for Seizing

New Jersey, Department of Law and Public Safety, Division of Criminal Justice, available at: 
www.state.nj.us/lps/dcj/pdfs/cmpmanfi.pdf.  

2208 Regarding the classification of the act of copying the data, see: Brenner/Frederiksen, Computer Searches and Seizure: 

Some Unresolved Issues in Cybercrime & Security, IB-1, page 58 et seq.  

2209 “Since the measures relate to stored intangible data, additional measures are required by competent authorities to 

secure the data; that is, ‘maintain the integrity of the data’, or maintain the ‘chain of custody’ of the data, meaning that 
the data which is copied or removed be retained in the State in which they were found at the time of the seizure and 
remain unchanged during the time of criminal proceedings. The term refers to taking control over or the taking away of 
data”. Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 197. 

2210 This principle also applies with regard to the seizure of hardware. Compared to maintaining the integrity of copied data 

it is often easier to maintain the integrity of data on a storage device.  

2211 See above: § 2.6. 
2212 One possibility to prevent access to the information without deleting it is the use of encryption technology.  
2213 See in this context: Williger/Wilson, Negotiating the Minefields of Electronic Discovery, Richmond Journal of Law and 

Technology, Vol. 10, Issue 5. 

2214   The fact that law-enforcement agencies are able to access certain data stored outside the country through a 
computer system in their territory does not automatically legalize the access. See Explanatory Report to the 
Convention on Cybercrime, No. 195. “This article does not address ‘transborder search and seizure’, whereby States 
could search and seize data in the territory of other States without having to go through the usual channels of mutual 
legal assistance. This issue is discussed below at the Chapter on international co-operation.” Two cases of transborder 
access to stored computer data are regulated in Art. 32 Convention on Cybercrime: 
Article 32 – Trans-border access to stored computer data with consent or where publicly available  
A Party may, without the authorisation of another Party:  
a) access publicly available (open source) stored computer data, regardless of where the data is located 
geographically; or  
b) access or receive, through a computer system in its territory, stored computer data located in another Party, if the 
Party obtains the lawful and voluntary consent of the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data to the 
Party through that computer system.  

 
 
 

 

2215 “It addresses the practical problem that it may be difficult to access and identify the data sought as evidence, given the 

quantity of data that can be processed and stored, the deployment of security measures, as well as the nature of 
computer operations. It recognises that system administrators, who have particular knowledge of the computer system, 
may need to be consulted concerning the technical modalities about how best the search should be conducted.” 
Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 200.  

2216 “A means to order the co-operation of knowledgeable persons would help in making searches more effective and cost 

efficient, both for law enforcement and innocent individuals affected. Legally compelling a system administrator to 
assist may also relieve the administrator of any contractual or other obligations not to disclose the data.” Explanatory

2219 Official Note: If the existing search and seizure provisions contain a description of the content of the warrant, either in a 

section or by a form, it will be necessary to review those provisions to ensure that they also include any necessary 
reference to computer data. 

2220 Official Note: A country may wish to add a definition of “assist” which could include providing passwords, encryption 
keys and other information necessary to access a computer. Such a definition would need to be drafted in accordance 
with its constitutional or common law protections against self-incrimination. 

2221 Regarding the motivation of the drafters, see Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 171. 
2222 “A “production order” provides a flexible measure which law enforcement can apply in many cases, especially instead 

of measures that are more intrusive or more onerous. The implementation of such a procedural mechanism will also be 
beneficial to third party custodians of data, such as ISPs, who are often prepared to assist law enforcement authorities 
on a voluntary basis by providing data under their control, but who prefer an appropriate legal basis for such assistance, 
relieving them of any contractual or non-contractual liability.” Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, 
No. 171. 

2223 Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 173. 
2224 “At the same time, a mere technical ability to access remotely stored data (e.g. the ability of a user to access through a 

network link remotely stored data not within his or her legitimate control) does not necessarily constitute “control” 
within the meaning of this provision. In some States, the concept denominated under law as “possession” covers 
physical and constructive possession with sufficient breadth to meet this “possession or control” requirement.” 
Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 173. 

2225 Regarding the possibilities to hinder IP-based investigations by using means of anonymous communication, see above: 

§ 3.2.12. 

2226 If the providers offer their service free of charge, they do often either require an identification of the user nor do at 

least not verify the registration information.  

2227 See above: § 6.3.5. 
2228 Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 172. 
2229 This can be, for example, information that was provided on a classic registration form and kept by the provider as paper 

records.  

2230 The Explanatory Report even points out that the parties to the Convention can adjust their safeguards with regard to 
specific data within each of the categories. See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 174: “Party 
may wish to prescribe different terms, different competent authorities and different safeguards concerning the 
submission of particular types of computer data or subscriber information held by particular categories of persons or 
service providers. For example, with respect to some types of data, such as publicly available subscriber information, a 
Party might permit law enforcement agents to issue such an order where in other situations a court order could be 
required. On the other hand, in some situations a Party might require, or be mandated by human rights safeguards to 
require that a production order be issued only by judicial authorities in order to be able to obtain certain types of data. 
Parties may wish to limit the disclosure of this data for law enforcement purposes to situations where a production 
order to disclose such information has been issued by judicial authorities. The proportionality principle also provides 
some flexibility in relation to the application of the measure, for instance in many States in order to exclude its 
application in minor cases.”  

2231 For example, the requirement of a court order. 
2232 The differentiation between the real-time collection of traffic data (Art. 20) and the real-time collection of content data 

(Art. 21) shows that the drafters of the Convention realized the importance of separating instruments with different 
impact.

2233 See below: § 6.3.9. 
2234 See below: § 6.3.10. 
2235 Art. 21 of the Convention on Cybercrime obliges the signatory states to implement the possibility to intercept content 

data only with regard to serious offences (“Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be 
necessary, in relation to a range of serious offences to be determined by domestic law”). On the contrary, Art. 20 of the 
Convention on Cybercrime is not limited to serious offences. “Due to the higher privacy interest associated with content 
data, the investigative measure is restricted to ‘a range of serious offences to be determined by domestic law’.” See: 
Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, No. 230.

2238   Official Note: As noted in the expert group report, in some countries it may be necessary to apply the same standard 
for production orders as is used for a search warrant because of the nature of the material that may be produced. In 
other countries it may be sufficient to employ a lower standard because the production process is less invasive than 
the search process. 
Official Note: Countries may wish to consider whether subparagraph c is appropriate for inclusion in domestic law 
because while it may be of great practical use, it requires the processing and compilation of data by court order, 
which may not be suitable for some jurisdictions.

2247 The “origin” refers to a telephone number, Internet protocol (IP) address or similar identification of a communications 

facility to which a service provider renders services. Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 30. 

2248 “In case of an investigation of a criminal offence committed in relation to a computer system, traffic data is needed to 
trace the source of a communication as a starting point for collecting further evidence or as part of the evidence of the 
offence. Traffic data might last only ephemerally, which makes it necessary to order its expeditious preservation. 

 

 

343 

Understanding cybercrime: Phenomena, challenges and legal response 

 
 

Consequently, its rapid disclosure may be necessary to discern the communication’s route in order to collect further 
evidence before it is deleted or to identify a suspect. The ordinary procedure for the collection and disclosure of 
computer data might therefore be insufficient. Moreover, the collection of this data is regarded in principle to be less 
intrusive since as such it doesn’t reveal the content of the communication which is regarded to be more sensitive.” See: 
Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 29. Regarding the importance of traffic data in cybercrime 
investigations, see also: ABA International Guide to Combating Cybercrime, page 125; Gercke, Preservation of User 
Data, DUD 2002, 577 et seq. 

2249 “In general, the two possibilities for collecting traffic data in paragraph 1(a) and (b) are not alternatives. Except as 
provided in paragraph 2, a Party must ensure that both measures can be carried out. This is necessary because if a 
service provider does not have the technical ability to assume the collection or recording of traffic data (1(b)), then a 
Party must have the possibility for its law enforcement authorities to undertake themselves the task (1(a)).” 
Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 223. 

2250 The Convention does not define technical standards regarding the design of such an interface. Explanatory Report to 

the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 220. 

2251 Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 223. 
2252 “The article [Art. 20] does not obligate service providers to ensure that they have the technical capability to undertake 
collections, recordings, co-operation or assistance. It does not require them to acquire or develop new equipment, hire 
expert support or engage in costly re-configuration of their systems.” Explanatory Report to the Convention on 
Cybercrime, No. 221. 
2253 See above: § 3.2.12. 
2254 Tor is a software that enables users to protect against traffic analysis. For more information about the software, see: 

http://tor.eff.org/.  

2255 An example of an approach to restrict the use of public terminals to commit criminal offences is Art. 7 of Italian Decree-
Law No. 144. The provision forces anybody who intends to offer public Internet access (e.g. Internet cafes) to apply for 
an authorization. In addition, he is obliged to request an identification from his customers prior to the use of his 
services. Decree-Law 27 July 2005, No. 144. – Urgent measures for combating international terrorism. For more 
information about the Decree-Law, see for example the article Privacy and data retention policies in selected countries, 
available at www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/PracticeNote.aspx?id=2026.  

2256 This advantage is also relevant for remote forensic investigations. See below: § 6.3.12. 
2257 Such obligation might be legal or contractual.  
2258 Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 226. 
2259 Regarding the key intention, see Explanatory Report on the Convention on Cybercrime No. 16: “The Convention aims 
principally at (1) harmonising the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offences and connected provisions in 
the area of cyber-crime (2) providing for domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and 
prosecution of such offences as well as other offences committed by means of a computer system or evidence in 
relation to which is in electronic form (3) setting up a fast and effective regime of international co-operation.” 
2260   The drafters of the Convention point out that the signatory states should limit the use of the right to make 

 
 
 

reservations in this context: Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 213. 
Regarding the possibilities of making reservations, see Art. 42 Convention on Cybercrime:  
Article 42  
By a written notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, any State may, at the time of 
signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, declare that it avails 
itself of the reservation(s) provided for in Article 4, paragraph 2, Article 6, paragraph 3, Article 9, paragraph 4, Article 
10, paragraph 3, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 14, paragraph 3, Article 22, paragraph 2, Article 29, paragraph 4, and

the use of encryption technology. Regarding the functioning of encryption procedures, see: Singh; The Code Book: The

2268 Regarding practical approaches to recover encrypted evidence, see: Casey, Practical Approaches to Recovering 

Encrypted Digital Evidence, International Journal of Digital Evidence, Vol. 1, Issue 3, available at: 

2269 The issue is, for example, addressed by Recommendation No. R (95) of the Committee of Ministers to Member States 

Concerning Problems of Criminal Procedure Law Connected with information, 11 September 1995: “14. Measures 
should be considered to minimise the negative effects of the use of cryptography on the investigation of criminal 
offenses, without affecting its legitimate use more than is strictly necessary” and the G8 in the 1997 Meeting in Denver: 
“To counter, inter alia, the use of strong encryption by terrorists, we have endorsed acceleration of consultations and 
adoption of the OECD guidelines for cryptography policy and invited all states to develop national policies on 
encryption, including key, management, which may allow, consistent with these guidelines. Lawful government access 
to prevent and investigate acts of terrorism and to find a mechanism to cooperate internationally in implementing such 
policies.” 

2270 For more information, see: Koops, The Crypto Controversy. A Key Conflict in the Information Society, Chapter 5.  
2271 The need for such authorization is mentioned, for example, in principle 6 of the 1997 Guidelines for Cryptography 

Policy: “National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to plaintext, or cryptographic keys, of encrypted data. 
These policies must respect the other principles contained in the guidelines to the greatest extent possible.” 

2272 This topic was discussed in the deliberations of the US District Court of New Jersey in the case United States v. Scarfo. 

The District Court decided that the federal wiretapping law and the Fourth Amendment allow law-enforcement 
agencies to make use of a software to record keystrokes on a suspect’s computer (keylogger) in order to intercept a 
passphrase to an encrypted file (if the system does not operate while the computer is communicating with other 
computers). See: www.epic.org/crypto/scarfo/opinion.html.  

2273 Export limitations on encryption software capable of processing strong keys are not designed to facilitate the work of 

law-enforcement agencies in the country. The intention of such regulations is to prevent the availability of the 
technology outside the country. For detailed information on import and export restrictions with regard to encryption 
technology, see: http://rechten.uvt.nl/koops/cryptolaw/index.htm.  

2274 The limitation of the import of such powerful software is even characterized as “misguided and harsh to the privacy 

rights of all citizens”. See, for example: The Walsh Report – Review of Policy relating to Encryption Technologies 1.1.16 
available at: www.efa.org.au/Issues/Crypto/Walsh/walsh.htm.

corporate security, Sophos white paper, 2005, available at: www.cehs.usu.edu/facultyandstaff/security/sophos-

2305 With regard to the efficiency of virus scanners and protection measures implemented in the operating systems, it is 

likely that the functioning of a remote forensic software would require the cooperation of software companies. If 
software companies agree to prevent detection of remote forensic software, this could result in serious risks for 
computer security. For more information, see: Gercke, Computer und Recht 2007, page 249.  

2306 If the offender stores illegal content on an external storage device that is not connected to a computer system, the 
investigators will in general not be able to identify the content if they only have access to the computer system via 
remote forensic software.

2326 The need to speed up the process of international cooperation is pointed out in the Explanatory Report. See 

Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 256: “Computer data is highly volatile. By a few keystrokes or 
by operation of automatic programs, it may be deleted, rendering it impossible to trace a crime to its perpetrator or 
destroying critical proof of guilt. Some forms of computer data are stored for only short periods of time before being 
deleted. In other cases, significant harm to persons or property may take place if evidence is not gathered rapidly. In 
such urgent cases, not only the request, but the response as well should be made in an expedited manner. The 
objective of Paragraph 3 is therefore to facilitate acceleration of the process of obtaining mutual assistance so that 
critical information or evidence is not lost because it has been deleted before a request for assistance could be 
prepared, transmitted and responded to.”

2363 See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 265: “Initially, direct transmission between such 

authorities is speedier and more efficient than transmission through diplomatic channels. In addition, the establishment 
of an active central authority serves an important function in ensuring that both incoming and outgoing requests are 
diligently pursued, that advice is provided to foreign law enforcement partners on how best to satisfy legal 
requirements in the requested Party, and that particularly urgent or sensitive requests are dealt with properly.” 

2364 See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 268. 
2365 See Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 269. “Such a situation could arise if, upon balancing the 

important interests involved in the particular case (on the one hand, public interests, including the sound 
administration of justice and, on the other hand, privacy interests), furnishing the specific data sought by the requesting 
Party would raise difficulties so fundamental as to be considered by the requested Party to fall within the essential

regulating this area. In part, this was due to a lack of concrete experience with such situations to date; and, in part, this 
was due to an understanding that the proper solution often turned on the precise circumstances of the individual case,

2385 In this context, it is necessary to point out a difference between Art. 32 and Art. 18. Unlike Art. 18, Art. 32 does not 
enable a foreign law-enforcement agency to order the submission of the relevant data. It can only seek permission.

2388 The need to speed up the process of international cooperation is pointed out in the Explanatory Report. See 

Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, No. 256: “Computer data is highly volatile. By a few keystrokes or 
by operation of automatic programs, it may be deleted, rendering it impossible to trace a crime to its perpetrator or 
destroying critical proof of guilt. Some forms of computer data are stored for only short periods of time before being 
deleted. In other cases, significant harm to persons or property may take place if evidence is not gathered rapidly. In 
such urgent cases, not only the request, but the response as well should be made in an expedited manner. The 
objective of Paragraph 3 is therefore to facilitate acceleration of the process of obtaining mutual assistance so that 
critical information or evidence is not lost because it has been deleted before a request for assistance could be 
prepared, transmitted and responded to.” 

2389 See above: § 6.3.4. 
2390 Availability 24 hours a day and 7 days a week is especially important with regard to the international dimension of 

cybercrime, as requests can potentially come from any time zone in the world. Regarding the international dimension of 
cybercrime and the related challenges, see above: § 3.2.6.

Appeals for the eighth circuit described (by referring to House Report No. 105-551(II) at 23 (1998)) the function of the 
United States DMCA by pointing out the balance. In the opinion of the court, DMCA has “two important priorities: 
promoting the continued growth and development of electronic commerce and protecting intellectual property rights.”

2425 This procedure is called “notice and takedown”. 
2426 The hosting provider is quite often in a difficult situation. On the one hand, it needs to react immediately to avoid 

liability; on the other hand, it has certain obligations to its customers. If it removes legal information that was just at 
first sight illegal, this could lead to claims for indemnity.  

2427 By enabling their customers to offer products, they provide the necessary storage capacity for the required information.

2432 Art. 21 – Re-examination 
 

1. Before 17 July 2003, and thereafter every two years, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, the 
Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of this Directive, accompanied, where 
necessary, by proposals for adapting it to legal, technical and economic developments in the field of information 
society services, in particular with respect to crime prevention, the protection of minors, consumer protection and to 
the proper functioning of the internal market.  
2. In examining the need for an adaptation of this Directive, the report shall in particular analyse the need for 
proposals concerning the liability of providers of hyperlinks and location tool services, ‘notice and take down’

de indemnización, o b) si lo tienen, actúen con diligencia para suprimir o inutilizar el enlace correspondiente. 
Se entenderá que el prestador de servicios tiene el conocimiento efectivo a que se refiere la letra a) cuando un 
órgano competente haya declarado la ilicitud de los datos, ordenado su retirada o que se imposibilite el acceso a los 
mismos, o se hubiera declarado la existencia de la lesión, y el prestador conociera la correspondiente resolución, sin 
perjuicio de los procedimientos de detección y retirada de contenidos que los prestadores apliquen en virtud de 
acuerdos voluntarios y de otros medios de conocimiento efectivo que pudieran establecerse.

2. den Empfänger der abgefragten Informationen nicht auswählt und  
3. die abgefragten Informationen weder auswählt noch verändert.
