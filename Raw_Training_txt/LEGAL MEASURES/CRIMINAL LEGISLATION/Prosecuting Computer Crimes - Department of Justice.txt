Preface and 
Acknowledgements

This  manual  examines  the  federal  laws  that  relate  to  computer  crimes. 
Our  focus  is  on  those  crimes  that  use  or  target  computer  networks,  which 
we interchangeably refer to as “computer crime,” “cybercrime,” and “network 
crime.” Examples of computer crime include computer intrusions, denial of 
service attacks, viruses, and worms. We do not attempt to cover issues of state 
law and do not cover every type of crime related to computers, such as child 
pornography or phishing. 

This publication is the second edition of “Prosecuting Computer Crimes” 
and  updates  the  previous  version  published  in  February  2007.  During  the 
three years since then, case law developed and, more importantly, Congress 
significantly amended the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Like the first edition of this manual, the revisions contained in this edition 
of the manual are the result of the efforts and knowledge of many people at 
CCIPS.  Scott  Eltringham  edited  and  published  it  under  the  supervision  of 
John  Lynch  and  Richard  Downing.  Substantial  assistance  was  provided  by 
Mysti Degani, Jenny Ellickson, Josh Goldfoot, and Jaikumar Ramaswamy, all 
of whom took lead responsibility for revising one or more chapters.

We are grateful to Ed Hagen and the Office of Legal Education for their 

assistance in publishing this manual and the prior edition.

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

Chapter 1
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

In the early 1980s law enforcement agencies faced the dawn of the computer 
age with growing concern about the lack of criminal laws available to fight 
emerging computer crimes. Although the wire and mail fraud provisions of 
the federal criminal code were capable of addressing some types of computer-
related criminal activity, neither of those statutes provided the full range of 
tools needed to combat these new crimes. See H.R. Rep. No. 98-894, at 6 
(1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3689, 3692.

In response, Congress included in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act 
of 1984 provisions to address the unauthorized access and use of computers and 
computer networks. The legislative history indicates that Congress intended 
these provisions to provide “a clearer statement of proscribed activity” to “the 
law enforcement community, those who own and operate computers, as well 
as those who may be tempted to commit crimes by unauthorized access.” Id. 
Congress  did  this  by  making  it  a  felony  to  access  classified  information  in 
a  computer  without  authorization  and  making  it  a  misdemeanor  to  access 
financial records or credit histories stored in a financial institution or to trespass 
into a government computer. In so doing, Congress opted not to add new 
provisions regarding computers to existing criminal laws, but rather to address 
federal computer-related offenses in a single, new statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1030.

Even  after  enacting  section  1030,  Congress  continued  to  investigate 
problems  associated  with  computer  crime  to  determine  whether  federal 
criminal  laws  required  further  revision.  Throughout  1985,  both  the  House 
and the Senate held hearings on potential computer crime bills, continuing 
the efforts begun the year before. These hearings culminated in the Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), enacted by Congress in 1986, which amended 
18 U.S.C. § 1030. 

In the CFAA, Congress attempted to strike an “appropriate balance between 
the  Federal  Government’s  interest  in  computer  crime  and  the  interests  and 
abilities of the States to proscribe and punish such offenses.” See S. Rep. No. 
99-432, at 4 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2482. Congress 
addressed federalism concerns in the CFAA by limiting federal jurisdiction to 

1

cases with a compelling federal interest—i.e., where computers of the federal 
government or certain financial institutions are involved or where the crime 
itself is interstate in nature. See id. 

In  addition  to  clarifying  a  number  of  the  provisions  in  the  original 
section 1030, the CFAA also criminalized additional computer-related acts. 
For example, Congress added a provision to penalize the theft of property via 
computer that occurs as a part of a scheme to defraud. Congress also added 
a provision to penalize those who intentionally alter, damage, or destroy data 
belonging to others. This latter provision was designed to cover such activities 
as  the  distribution  of  malicious  code  and  denial  of  service  attacks.  Finally, 
Congress also included in the CFAA a provision criminalizing trafficking in 
passwords and similar items.

As computer crimes continued to grow in sophistication and as prosecutors 
gained experience with the CFAA, the CFAA required further amending, which 
Congress did in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2001, 2002, and 2008. The 
2008 amendments made the following changes to section 1030:

•	 Eliminated	 the	 requirement	 in	 18	 U.S.C.	 §	 1030(a)(2)(C)	 that	
information  must  have  been  stolen  through  an  interstate  or  foreign 
communication,  thereby  expanding  jurisdiction  for  cases  involving 
theft of information from computers;

•	 Eliminated	 the	 requirement	 in	 18	 U.S.C.	 §	 1030(a)(5)	 that	 the	
defendant’s action must result in a loss exceeding $5,000 and created a 
felony offense where the damage affects ten or more computers, closing 
a gap in the law;

•	 Expanded	 18	 U.S.C.	 §	 1030(a)(7)	 to	 criminalize	 not	 only	 explicit	
threats to cause damage to a computer, but also threats to (1) steal data 
on a victim's computer, (2) publicly disclose stolen data, or (3) not 
repair damage the offender already caused to the computer;

•	 Created	 a	 criminal	 offense	 for	 conspiring	 to	 commit	 a	 computer	

hacking offense under section 1030;

•	 Broadened	 the	 definition	 of	 “protected	 computer”	 in	 18	 U.S.C.	
§ 1030(e)(2)  to  the  full  extent  of  Congress’s  commerce  power  by 
including  those  computers  used  in  or  affecting  interstate  or  foreign 
commerce or communication; and

2  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

•	 Provided	a	mechanism	for	civil	and	criminal	forfeiture	of	property	used	

in or derived from section 1030 violations.

Aside  from  the  list  above,  this  manual  does  not  explore  each  of  these 
amendments, but focuses on the law as it exists at the date of the publication 
of  this  manual.  Additional  information  on  some  of  the  more  significant 
amendments may be found on the CCIPS website, www.cybercrime.gov.

The current version of the CFAA includes seven types of criminal activity, 
outlined in Table 1 below. Conspiracy to commit and attempts to commit these 
crimes are also crimes. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(b). However, despite the fact that a 
conspiracy charge under section 1030(b) does not require proof of an overt act, 
CCIPS recommends using section 371 to charge conspiracies due to the lack 
of clarity on penalties. See pages 55-56. Lawfully authorized activities of law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies are explicitly excluded from coverage of 
section 1030. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(f).

In some circumstances, the CFAA allows victims who suffer specific types 
of loss or damage as a result of violations of the Act to bring civil actions against 
the violators for compensatory damages and injunctive or other equitable relief. 
18 U.S.C. § 1030(g). This manual does not address the civil provisions of the 
statute except as they may pertain to the criminal provisions.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

3

A.  Key Definitions

Two terms are common to most prosecutions under section 1030 and are 
discussed below: “protected computer” and “authorization.” Other terms are 
discussed with their applicable subsection.

 

1.  Protected Computer
The  term  “protected  computer,”  18  U.S.C.  §  1030(e)(2),  is  a  statutory 
term of art that has nothing to do with the security of the computer. In a 
nutshell, “protected computer” covers computers used in or affecting interstate 
or  foreign  commerce  and  computers  used  by  the  federal  government  and 
financial institutions.

Section 1030(e)(2) defines protected computer as:
 

a computer—
(A)  exclusively  for  the  use  of  a  financial  institution  or  the 
United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not 
exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution 
or the United States Government and the conduct constituting 
the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or 
the Government; or 
(B) which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce 
or communication . . . . 

18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2). Note that the computer must be “used in or affecting” 
not  “used  by  the  defendant  in”—that  is,  it  is  enough  that  the  computer  is 
connected to the Internet; the statute does not require proof that the defendant 
also used the Internet to access the computer or used the computer to access 
the Internet.

Several courts have held that using the Internet from a computer is sufficient 
to meet this element. See, e.g., United States v. Drew, 259 F.R.D. 449, 457 
(C.D.  Cal.  2009)  (“[T]he  latter  two  elements  of  the  section  1030(a)(2)(C) 
crime  [obtaining  information  from  a  protected  computer]  will  always  be 
met when an individual using a computer contacts or communicates with an 
Internet website.”); United States v. Trotter, 478 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir. 2007) 
(“No additional interstate nexus is required when instrumentalities or channels 
of interstate commerce are regulated.”) (internal citations omitted); Paradigm 
Alliance,  Inc.  v.  Celeritas Technologies,  LLC,  248  F.R.D.  598,  602  (D.  Kan. 

4  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

2008) (“As a practical matter, a computer providing a ‘web-based’ application 
accessible through the internet would satisfy the ‘interstate communication’ 
requirement.”).

Prior to 2008, this definition did not explicitly cover computers that were 
not connected to the Internet and that were not used by the federal government 
or  financial  institutions.  For  example,  some  state-run  utility  companies 
operate computers that are not connected to the Internet for security reasons. 
Congress remedied this gap in the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution 
Act of 2008 by broadening the definition of “protected computer” to include 
computers that “affect” interstate or foreign commerce or communications. 18 
U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(B).

In the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress amended the definition of “protected 
computer”  to  make  clear  that  this  term  includes  computers  outside  of 
the  United  States  so  long  as  they  affect  “interstate  or  foreign  commerce  or 
communication of the United States.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(B) (2001). This 
change addresses situations where an attacker within the United States attacks a 
computer system located abroad and situations in which individuals in foreign 
countries route communications through the United States as they hack from 
one foreign country to another. Both situations can therefore be violations of 
section 1030.

 

2.  “Without Authorization” or “Exceeds Authorized Access” 
Several of the criminal offenses in the CFAA require that the defendant 
access  a  computer  “without  authorization.”  See  18  U.S.C.  §§  1030(a)(3), 
(a)(5)(B),  (a)(5)(C).  Others  require  that  the  defendant  either  access  a 
computer “without authorization” or “exceed authorized access.” See 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 1030(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4). The term “without authorization” is not defined 
by the CFAA. The term “exceeds authorized access” means “to access a computer 
with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the 
computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.” 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(e)(6). 

The  legislative  history  of  the  CFAA  reflects  an  expectation  that  persons 
who “exceed authorized access” will be insiders (e.g., employees using a victim’s 
corporate computer network), while persons who access computers “without 
authorization” will typically be outsiders (e.g., hackers). See S. Rep. No. 99-
432, at 10 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479 (discussing section 
1030(a)(5), “insiders, who are authorized to access a computer, face criminal 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

5

liability only if they intend to cause damage to the computer, not for recklessly 
or negligently causing damage. By contrast, outside intruders who break into 
a computer could be punished for any intentional, reckless, or other damage 
they cause by their trespass.”); S. Rep. No. 104-357, at 11 (1996), available at 
1996 WL 492169; United States v. Phillips, 477 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir. 2007) 
(discussing legislative history). 

Civil  cases  interpreting  the  authorization  elements  of  CFAA  offenses 
have  often  followed  this  insider/outsider  distinction  and  concluded  that 
insiders “exceed authorized access,” while outsiders access computers “without 
authorization.” However, some courts have diverged from this general approach 
and have found that insiders acted “without authorization” in certain civil cases. 
The next two subsections discuss the contours of “without authorization” and 
“exceeding authorized access” in more detail.

 

  Without Authorization
It  is  relatively  easy  to  define  the  universe  of  individuals  who  lack  any 
authorization to access a computer. When someone from this group of people 
accesses  the  computer,  the  access  is  necessarily  “without  authorization”  for 
purposes  of  the  CFAA.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Ivanov,  175  F.  Supp.  2d 
367 (D. Conn. 2001) (Russian hacker accessed victim company’s computers 
without  authorization).  A  more  difficult  question  is  whether  a  person  with 
some authorization to access a computer can ever act “without authorization” 
with respect to that computer. The case law on this issue is muddy, but, as 
discussed  below,  there  is  growing  consensus  that  such  “insiders”  cannot  act 
“without  authorization”  unless  and  until  their  authorization  to  access  the 
computer is rescinded. 

Prosecutors rarely argue that a defendant accessed a computer “without 
authorization” when the defendant had some authority to access that computer. 
However, several civil cases have held that defendants lost their authorization 
to access computers when they breached a duty of loyalty to the authorizing 
parties, even if the authorizing parties were unaware of the breach. See, e.g., Int’l 
Airport Ctrs., LLC v. Citrin,1 440 F.3d 418, 420-21 (7th Cir. 2006); Shurgard 

1 Citrin is the leading authority for the position that a breach of the duty of loyalty can 
 
terminate authorization to access a computer, but its interpretation of “without authoriza-
tion” may be considered dicta. The CFAA claim in Citrin was brought under 18 U.S.C. § 
1030(a)(5)(A)(i) (now § 1030(a)(5)(A)), which did not require proof that the defendant ac-
cessed a computer at all, much less that such access occurred without or in excess of authoriza-
tion. See Int’l Airport Ctrs., LLC v. Citrin, 2005 WL 241463, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 2005), rev’d, 440 

6  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

Storage Ctrs., Inc. v. Safeguard Self Storage, Inc., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1125 
(W.D. Wash. 2000); Ervin & Smith Advertising and Public Relations, Inc. v. 
Ervin, 2009 WL 249998 (D. Neb. 2009). Some of these cases further suggest 
that such a breach can occur when the user decides to access the computer 
for  a  purpose  that  is  contrary  to  the  interests  of  the  authorizing  party.  See, 
e.g.,  Citrin,  440  F.3d  at  420  (defendant’s  authorization  to  access  computer 
terminated when he resolved to destroy employer’s files); ViChip Corp. v. Lee, 
438 F. Supp. 2d 1087, 1100 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (same); NCMIC Finance Corp. 
v. Artino, 638 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1057 (S.D. Iowa 2009) (“[T]he determinative 
question  is  whether  Artino  breached  his  duty  of  loyalty  to  NCMIC  when 
Artino obtained information from NCMIC’s computers.”).

The Citrin/Shurgard line of cases has been criticized by courts adopting the 
view that, under the CFAA, an authorized user of a computer cannot access 
the  computer  “without  authorization”  unless  and  until  the  authorization  is 
revoked.  Most  significantly,  the  Ninth  Circuit  recently  rejected  Citrin’s 
interpretation  of  “without  authorization”  and  found  that,  under  the  plain 
language of the CFAA, a user’s authorization to access a computer depends on 
the actions of the authorizing party and not on the user’s duty of loyalty. See 
LVRC Holdings LLC v. Brekka, 581 F.3d 1127, 1133-34 (9th Cir. 2009) (“It is 
the employer’s decision to allow or to terminate an employee’s authorization to 
access a computer that determines whether the employee is with or ‘without 
authorization.’”). The court also suggested that Citrin’s reading of the CFAA 
is inconsistent with the rule of lenity, which requires courts to construe any 
ambiguity in a criminal statute against the government. Id. at 1134-35. The 
court then held that “a person uses a computer ‘without authorization’ . . . when 
the person has not received permission to use the computer for any purpose 
(such as when a hacker accesses someone’s computer without any permission), 
or when the employer has rescinded permission to access the computer and the 
defendant uses the computer anyway.” Id. at 1135.

Several  district  courts  have  also  recently  moved  away  from  the  Citrin/
Shurgard  view  that  a  user  can  lose  authorization  to  access  a  computer  by 

F.3d 418 (7th Cir. 2006) (“Plaintiffs do not assert that Citrin accessed a computer without 
authorization.”). After analyzing the § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i) claim that plaintiff actually alleged, 
the Seventh Circuit then opined that the defendant had also violated § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) (now 
§ 1030(a)(5)(B)), which did require that the defendant access a computer without authoriza-
tion. See Citrin, 440 F.3d at 420. The court appears to have been discussing this hypothetical 
§ 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii) claim when it stated that an employee could lose authorization to access 
his employer’s computer by breaching a duty of loyalty to the employer.

breaching a duty of loyalty to the authorizing party. See, e.g., Bell Aerospace 
Services, Inc. v. U.S. Aero Services, Inc., 690 F. Supp. 2d 1267 (M.D. Ala. 2010); 
U.S. Bioservices v. Lugo, 595 F. Supp. 2d 1189 (D. Kan. 2009); Losco Foods v.

Martin  Corp.  v.  Speed,  2006  WL  2683058,  at  *4  (M.D.  Fla.  2006).  These 
courts, like the Ninth Circuit, generally hold that an authorized computer user 
can never access the computer “without authorization” unless and until the 
authorization is rescinded. See, e.g., Shamrock Foods, 535 F. Supp. 2d at 967 
(“[A] violation for accessing ‘without authorization’ occurs only where initial 
access is not permitted.”).

Exceeding Authorized Access

Based on this recent case law, courts appear increasingly likely to reject the 
idea that a defendant accessed a computer “without authorization” in insider 
cases—cases where the defendant had some current authorization to access the 
computer. Accordingly, prosecutors should think carefully before charging such 
defendants with violations that require the defendants to access a computer 
“without  authorization”  and  instead  consider  bringing  charges  under  those 
subsections that require proof that the defendant exceeded authorized access.
 

 
Several provisions of the CFAA impose criminal liability on a defendant who, 
among other things, “exceeds authorized access” when accessing a computer. 
See  18  U.S.C.  §§  1030(a)(1),  (a)(2),  &  (a)(4).  The  CFAA  defines  “exceeds 
authorized access” as “to access a computer with authorization and to use such 
access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not 
entitled so to obtain or alter.”2 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(6). Accordingly, to prove 
that someone has “exceeded authorized access,” prosecutors should be prepared 
to present evidence showing (a) how the person’s authority to obtain or alter 
information on the computer was limited, rather than absolute, and (b) how 
the person exceeded those limitations in obtaining or altering information. 

It is relatively easy to prove that a defendant had only limited authority 
to  access  a  computer  in  cases  where  the  defendant’s  access  was  limited  by 
 
2 “Viewing material on a computer screen constitutes ‘obtaining’ information under the 
CFAA.” Healthcare Advocates, Inc. v. Harding, Earley, Follmer & Frailey, 497 F. Supp. 2d 627, 
648 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (citing legislative history for CFAA).

restrictions  that  were  memorialized  in  writing,  such  as  terms  of  service,  a 
computer  access  policy,  a  website  notice,  or  an  employment  agreement  or 
similar contract. See, e.g., EF Cultural Travel BV v. Zefer Corp., 318 F.3d 58 (1st 
Cir. 2003) (website notices); Cont’l Group, Inc. v. KW Prop. Mgmt., LLC, 622 F. 
Supp. 2d 1357, 1372 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (computer access policies); United States 
v. Drew,3 259 F.R.D. 449 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (website terms of service); Modis, 
Inc.  v.  Bardelli,  531  F.  Supp.  2d  314,  319  (D.  Conn.  2008)  (employment 
agreement); Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Byd:Sign, Inc., 2007 WL 275476, at *13 
(E.D. Tex. 2007) (confidentiality agreement); Am. Online, Inc. v. Nat’l Health 
Care Discount, Inc., 174 F. Supp. 2d 890, 899 (N.D. Iowa 2001) (email terms 
of service). In addition, password protection is an implicit (and technological) 
limit on access for otherwise authorized users who are not given the password. 
See EF Cultural Travel BV v. Zefer Corp., 318 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 2003). However, 
courts have split on the question of whether limits on authorized access can 
be reasonably inferred from the circumstances in cases where no explicit or 
implicit restrictions on access existed. Compare EF Cultural Travel BV v. Zefer 
Corp., 318 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 2003) (rejecting “reasonable expectations” test for 
lack of authorization), with United States v. Phillips, 477 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir. 
2007) (“Courts have . . . typically analyzed the scope of a user’s authorization 
to access a protected computer on the basis of the expected norms of intended 
use or the nature of the relationship established between the computer owner 
and the user.”).4

The  most  commonly  litigated  issue  about  “exceeding  authorized  access” 
in  reported  opinions  is  whether  a  particular  defendant  exceeded  authorized 
access by accessing the computer for an improper purpose. The cases on this 
 
3 Although United States v. Drew confirms that the government may rely on a website’s 
terms of service to establish that a website user exceeded her authorization to access the site, 
the district court also held in that case that the CFAA is unconstitutionally vague to the extent 
that it permits a defendant to be charged with a misdemeanor violation of § 1030(a)(2)(C) 
based on a conscious violation of a website’s terms of service. 259 F.R.D. 449, 464 (C.D. 
Cal. 2009) (“[I]f any conscious breach of a website’s terms of service is held to be sufficient 
by itself to constitute intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess 
of authorization, the result will be that section 1030(a)(2)(C) becomes a law ‘that affords too 
much discretion to the police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use the [Internet].’”).
 
4 Note that one author argues that the law would be better off if all “unauthorized access” 
cases were based only on code-based restrictions, arguing that “contract-based” restrictions are 
harder to define. Orin S. Kerr, “Cybercrime’s Scope: Interpreting ‘Access’ and ‘Authorization’ 
in Computer Misuse Statutes,” 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1596 (2003). However, this proposal would 
essentially read “exceeding authorized access” out of the statute, which the author generally 
acknowledges. Id. at 1662-63.

issue are difficult to untangle, but this argument generally arises in one of three 
contexts: (1) the authorizing party has expressly prohibited the defendant from 
accessing the computer for the improper purpose; (2) the authorizing party has 
expressly prohibited the defendant from using the authorizing party’s data for 
the improper purpose but did not condition the defendant’s computer access 
on compliance with this prohibition; and (3) the authorizing party did not 
expressly prohibit the defendant from using its data for the improper purpose, 
but the defendant was acting against the authorizing party’s interests. 

The first category of cases is the least controversial. Because the authorizing 
party  explicitly  imposed  a  purpose-based  limitation  on  the  defendant’s 
computer access, a defendant exceeds authorized access when he accesses the 
computer for an expressly forbidden purpose. See, e.g., United States v. John, 
597 F.3d 263, 272 (5th Cir. 2010) (“Access to a computer and data that can 
be obtained from that access may be exceeded if the purposes for which the 
access has been given are exceeded.”); Cont’l Group, Inc. v. KW Prop. Mgmt., 
LLC, 622 F. Supp. 2d 1357, 1372 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (computer access policies 
stated that computers were provided “for business use” and were “to be used 
solely for the [authorizing party’s] purposes”); United States v. Salum, 257 Fed. 
Appx.  225,  227  (11th  Cir.  2007)  (officers  could  access  NCIC  system  only 
for official business of criminal justice agency); Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 
126 F. Supp. 2d 238, 242-43, 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff’d, 356 F.3d 393 (2d 
Cir. 2004) (in order to submit query to website, users must agree not to use 
responsive data for direct marketing activities); United States v. Czubinski, 106 
F.3d 1069, 1071 (1st Cir. 1997) (“[IRS] employees may not use any Service 
computer system for other than official purposes.”).

It may be more difficult to prove that a defendant exceeded authorized 
access in the second category of cases. In these cases, the authorizing party 
has  expressly  prohibited  the  defendant  from  using  the  authorizing  party’s 
data for certain purposes, but it did not condition the defendant’s computer 
access on compliance with this prohibition. For example, the defendant might 
have  signed  a  confidentiality  agreement  in  which  he  agreed  not  to  use  the 
authorizing party’s information for personal gain, but the agreement did not 
specifically  prohibit  the  defendant  from  accessing  the  authorizing  party’s 
computer  for  that  purpose.  In  essence,  the  authorizing  party  has  explicitly 
limited the defendant’s authorization to use information that he might find on 
the computer, but it has not imposed the same purpose-based limitations on 
the defendant’s authorization to obtain or alter that information. The CFAA 

10  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

provides that a defendant “exceeds authorized access” when he “obtain[s] or 
alter[s] information in the computer that [he] is not entitled so to obtain or 
alter,” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(6), but it does not discuss using the information 
in an unauthorized way. Because of this statutory language, several courts have 
concluded that defendants did not “exceed authorized access” when they were 
permitted to obtain certain information from the computers, but then used 
that information for a specifically forbidden purpose. See, e.g., Brett Senior & 
Assocs, P.C. v. Fitzgerald, 2007 WL 2043377, at *4 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (defendant 
permissibly copied data from computer but then allegedly used data in a way 
that violated his employment contract); Int’l Ass’n of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers  v.  Werner-Masuda,  390  F.  Supp.  2d  479,  498-99  (D.  Md.  2005) 
(defendant  was  authorized  to  access  data  on  proprietary  website  but  then 
violated agreement not to use the data for certain purposes). However, at least 
one circuit has upheld an “exceeding authorized access” claim in this context. 
See EF Cultural Travel BV v. Explorica, 274 F.3d 577, 582-83 (1st Cir. 2001) 
(defendant exceeded authorized access by disclosing computer data in violation 
of confidentiality agreement).

The  third  and  final  category  of  “improper  purposes”  cases  is  arguably 
the most controversial. In these cases, the defendant accessed the computer 
within the limits of his authorization but used the computer for a purpose 
that was contrary to the implicit interests or intent of the authorizing party. 
The case law is divided on whether these facts are sufficient to establish that 
the defendant exceeded authorized access. Some courts have concluded that 
the improper purpose, without more, establishes that the defendant exceeded 
authorized access. See, e.g., Motorola, Inc. v. Lemko Corp., 609 F. Supp. 2d 760, 
767 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (“Allegations that an employee e-mailed and downloaded 
confidential information for an improper purpose are sufficient to state a claim 
that the employee exceeded her authorization.”). These cases typically rely on 
the reasoning set forth in Citrin, 440 F.3d at 420-21, which is discussed in 
more detail in the previous subsection.

However, a number of recent civil cases have rejected the idea that users 
can exceed authorized access within the meaning of section 1030(e)(6) when 
they access information that they are authorized to access, even if their access 
is  motivated  by  an  implicitly  improper  purpose.  See,  e.g.,  LVRC  Holdings 
LLC  v.  Brekka,  581  F.3d  1127,  1135  n.7  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (stating  in  dicta 
that defendant does not “exceed authorized access” under the CFAA when he 
breaches a duty of loyalty to authorizing party); Bell Aerospace Services, Inc. v.

B.  Obtaining National Security Information: 

18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(1)

The  infrequently-used  section  1030(a)(1)  punishes  the  act  of  obtaining 
national security information without or in excess of authorization and then 
willfully providing or attempting to provide the information to an unauthorized 
recipient, or willfully retaining the information. 

Any  steps  in  investigating  or 
indicting  a  case  under 
section 
1030(a)(1) require the prior approval 
of the National Security Division of 
the  Department  of  Justice,  through 
the  Counterespionage  Section.  See 
USAM  9-90.020.  Please  contact 
them at (202) 514-1187.

Title  18,  United  States  Code, 

Section 1030(a)(1) provides:

Whoever—

1.  Knowingly access computer without or 

in excess of authorization

2.  obtain national security information 
3.  reason to believe the information could 
injure the U.S. or benefit a foreign nation

4.  willful communication, delivery, 

transmission (or attempt)
  OR

 
  willful retention of the information

(1) having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization 
or  exceeding  authorized  access,  and  by  means  of  such  conduct 
having  obtained  information  that  has  been  determined  by  the 
United  States  Government  pursuant  to  an  Executive  order  or 
statute  to  require  protection  against  unauthorized  disclosure  for 
reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted 
data,  as  defined  in  paragraph  y.  of  section  11  of  the  Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, with reason to believe that such information 
so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States, or

transmitted,  or  attempts  to  communicate,  deliver,  transmit  or 
cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to 
any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same 
and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States 
entitled to receive it . . .

shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

 
 

In Excess of Authorization

1.  Knowingly Access a Computer Without or 
 
A  violation  of  this  section  requires  proof  that  the  defendant  knowingly 
accessed a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization. This 
covers both completely unauthorized individuals who intrude into a computer 
containing  national  security  information  as  well  as  insiders  with  limited 
privileges who manage to access portions of a computer or computer network 
to which they have not been granted access. The scope of authorization will 
depend upon the facts of each case. However, it is worth noting that computers 
and computer networks containing national security information will normally 
be classified and incorporate security safeguards and access controls of their 
own, which should facilitate proving this element.

Please see page 5 for the discussion of access and authorization.

 

2.  Obtain National Security Information
A  violation  of  this  section  requires  that  the  information  obtained  is 
national security information, meaning information “that has been determined 
by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive Order or statute 
to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national 
defense  or  foreign  relations,  or  any  restricted  data,  as  defined  in  paragraph 
y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.” An example of national 
security information used in section 1030(a)(1) would be classified information 
obtained from a Department of Defense computer or restricted data obtained 
from a Department of Energy computer.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

13

 
 

or Benefit a Foreign Nation

3.  Information Could Injure the United States 
 
A violation of this section requires proof that the defendant had reason 
to believe that the national security information so obtained could be used to 
the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. The 
fact that the national security information is classified or restricted, along with 
proof of the defendant’s knowledge of that fact, should be sufficient to establish 
this element of the offense.

 

4.  Willful Communication, Delivery, Transmission, or Retention
A  violation  of  this  section  requires  proof  that  the  defendant  willfully 
communicated,  delivered,  or  transmitted  the  national  security  information, 
attempted to do so, or willfully retained the information instead of delivering 
it to the intended recipient. This element could be proven through evidence 
showing  that  the  defendant  did  any  of  the  following:  (a)  communicated, 
delivered,  or  transmitted  national  security  information,  or  caused  it  to  be 
communicated, delivered, or transmitted, to any person not entitled to receive 
it;  (b)  attempted  to  communicate,  deliver,  or  transmit  national  security 
information,  or  attempted  to  cause  it  to  be  communicated,  delivered,  or 
transmitted to any person not entitled to receive it; or (c) willfully retained 
national security information and failed to deliver it to an officer or employee 
of the United States who is entitled to receive it in the course of their official 
duties. 

 

5.  Penalties
Convictions  under  this  section  are  felonies  punishable  by  a  fine, 
imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(1)(A). 
A violation that occurs after another conviction under section 1030 is punishable 
by a fine, imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(c)(1)(B). 

 

6.  Relation to Other Statutes
Section 1030(a)(1) was originally enacted in 1984 and was substantially 
amended  in  1996.  As  originally  enacted,  section 1030(a)(1)  provided  that 
anyone who knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or in excess 
of authorization and obtained classified information “with the intent or reason 
to believe that such information so obtained is to be used to the injury of the 

14  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation” was subject to a fine 
or imprisonment for not more than ten years for a first offense. This scienter 
element mirrored that of 18 U.S.C. § 794(a), the statute that prohibits gathering 
or delivering defense information to aid a foreign government. Section 794(a), 
however, provides for life imprisonment, whereas section 1030(a)(1) is only a 
ten-year felony. Based on that distinction, Congress amended section 1030(a)
(1) in 1996 to track more closely the language of 18 U.S.C. § 793(e), which 
also  provides  a  maximum  penalty  of  ten  years  imprisonment  for  obtaining 
from any source certain information connected with the national defense and 
thereafter communicating or attempting to communicate it in an unauthorized 
manner.

Violations of this subsection are charged quite rarely. The reason for this lack 
of prosecution may well be the close similarities between sections 1030(a)(1) 
and 793(e). In situations where both statutes are applicable, prosecutors may 
tend towards using section 793(e), for which guidance and precedent are more 
prevalent.

Although sections 793(e) and 1030(a)(1) overlap, the two statutes do not 
reach  exactly  the  same  conduct.  Section  1030(a)(1)  requires  proof  that  the 
individual knowingly accessed a computer without or in excess of authority 
and  thereby  obtained  national  security  information,  and  subsequently 
performed  some  unauthorized  communication  or  other  improper  act  with 
that data. In this way, it focuses not only on the possession of, control over, 
or subsequent transmission of the information (as section 793(e) does), but 
also  focuses  on  the  improper  use  of  a  computer  to  obtain  the  information 
itself. Existing espionage laws such as section 793(e) provide solid grounds for 
the prosecution of individuals who attempt to peddle governmental secrets to 
foreign governments. However, when a person, without authorization or in 
excess of authorized access, deliberately accesses a computer, obtains national 
security information, and seeks to transmit or communicate that information 
to  any  prohibited  person,  prosecutors  should  consider  charging  a  violation 
section 1030(a)(1) in addition to considering charging a violation of section 
793(e).

One other issue to note is that section 808 of the USA PATRIOT Act 
added section 1030(a)(1) to the list of crimes in that are considered “Federal 
Crime[s]  of  Terrorism”  under  18  U.S.C.  § 2332b(g)(5)(B).  This  addition 
affects  prosecutions  under  section 1030(a)(1)  in  three  ways.  First,  because 
offenses  listed  under  section 2332b(g)(5)(B)  are  now  incorporated  into  18 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

15

U.S.C. § 3286, the statute of limitation for subsection (a)(1) is extended to 
eight years and is eliminated for offenses that result in, or create a foreseeable 
risk  of,  death  or  serious  bodily  injury  to  another  person.  Second,  the  term 
of  supervised  release  after  imprisonment  for  any  offense  listed  under 
section 2332b(g)(5)(B) that results in, or creates a foreseeable risk of, death 
or serious bodily injury to another person, can be any term of years or life. 
18 U.S.C. § 3583. Formerly, the maximum term of supervised release for any 
violation of section 1030 was five years. Third, the USA PATRIOT Act added 
the offenses listed in section 2332b(g)(5)(B) to 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), making 
them predicate offenses for prosecutions under the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. As a result, any “RICO enterprise” 
(which  may  include  terrorist  groups)  that  violates  section 1030(a)(1)  (or 
section 1030(a)(5)(A)) can now be prosecuted under the RICO statute.

C.   Accessing a Computer and Obtaining Information: 

18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)
The distinct but overlapping crimes 
established  by  the  three  subsections 
of  section  1030(a)(2)  punish 
the 
unauthorized access of different types of 
information and computers. Violations 
of this section are misdemeanors unless 
aggravating factors exist.

Title  18,  United  States  Code, 

Section 1030(a)(2) provides:

Whoever— 
(2) intentionally accesses a computer 
without  authorization  or  exceeds 
authorized  access,  and 
thereby 
obtains—

(A)  information  contained  in  a 
financial  record  of  a  financial 
institution,  or  of  a  card  issuer 
as defined in section 1602(n) of 
title 15, or contained in a file of 

1030(a)(2) Summary (Misd.)

2.  without or in excess of authorization
3.  obtain information

  OR

a consumer reporting agency on a consumer, as such terms are defined 
in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.);
(B) information from any department or agency of the United States; 
or
(C) information from any protected computer . . .

shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
Some intrusions may violate more than one subsection. For example, a 
computer intrusion into a federal agency’s computer in violation of section 
1030(a)(2)(B) might also be covered as information obtained from a “protected 
computer” under section 1030(a)(2)(C).

Section 1030(a)(2) does not impose a monetary threshold for a misdemeanor 
violation, in recognition of the fact that some invasions of privacy do not lend 
themselves  to  monetary  valuation  but  still  warrant  federal  protection.  For 
example, it may be difficult to measure the harm in dollars where an individual 
unlawfully downloads sensitive medical information from a hospital’s computer 
or gathers personal data from the National Crime Information Center. Although 
there is no monetary threshold for establishing a misdemeanor offense under 
section 1030(a)(2), the value of the information obtained during an intrusion 
can elevate the crime to a felony.

 

1.  Intentionally Access a Computer
A violation of this section generally requires that the defendant actually 
access a computer without or in excess of authorization, rather than merely 
receive  information  that  was  accessed  without  or  in  excess  of  authorization 
by  another.  For  example,  if  A  obtains  information  in  violation  of  section 
1030(a)(2) and forwards it to B, B has not violated this section, even if B knew 
the source of the information. See Role Models America, Inc. v. Jones, 305 F. 
Supp. 2d 564 (D. Md. 2004). Of course, depending on the facts, B might be 
subject to prosecution for participating in a criminal conspiracy to violate this 
section or for aiding and abetting a violation. 

In  1986,  Congress  changed  the  intent  standard  in  this  section  from 
“knowingly”  to  “intentionally”  in  order  to  emphasize  that  “intentional  acts 
of unauthorized access—rather than mistaken, inadvertent, or careless ones—
are  precisely  what  the  Committee  intends  to  proscribe.”  S.  Rep.  No.  432, 
99th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2483. They also

computer files or data belonging to another.” Id. at 2484 (emphasis added); see

2.  Without or In Excess of Authorization
Please see page 5 for the discussion of access and authorization.

 

3.  Obtained Information
The term “obtaining information” is an expansive one that includes merely 
viewing information without downloading or copying a file. See S. Rep. No. 
99-432, at 6; America Online, Inc. v. National Health Care Discount, Inc., 121 
F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1275 (N.D. Iowa 2000). Information stored electronically 
can be obtained not only by actual physical theft, but also by “mere observation 
of the data.” Id. The “crux of the offense under subsection 1030(a)(2)(C) . . . is 
the abuse of a computer to obtain the information.” Id.

“Information”  includes  intangible  goods;  section  1030(a)(2)  therefore 
covers conduct not necessarily covered by other statutes. In United States v. 
Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991), the Tenth Circuit held that 
purely intangible intellectual property, such as a computer program, did not 
constitute goods or services that can be stolen or converted in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2314-15 (transportation and possession of stolen property). 925 
F.2d at 1306-07. In the 1996 amendments to section 1030, Congress clarified 
that section 1030(a)(2) would “ensure that the theft of intangible information 
by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft of 
physical items are protected.” S. Rep. No. 104-357, at 7, available at 1996 WL 
492169.

 
 

4.  Target
  Department or Agency of the United States
Department or agency includes any federal government entity, including 

the legislature, judiciary, and all parts of the Executive Branch.

“Department” is defined in the CFAA as “the legislative or judicial branch 
of the Government or one of the [fifteen] executive departments enumerated in 
section 101 of title 5.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(7). Although “agency” is not defined 
in section 1030, the general provisions section of Title 18 defines “agency” as 
“any  department,  independent  establishment,  commission,  administration, 

18  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which 
the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such 
term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.” 18 U.S.C. § 6.

Under case law, a particular entity is considered an agency when the federal 
government  exercises  considerable  control  over  it,  or  the  United  States  has 
a proprietary interest in the entity. See Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc. v. FDIC, 
789 F.2d 313, 314 (5th Cir. 1986) (“[W]hen the interest of the United States 
is more than incidental or custodial the corporation meets the definition of 
agency.” (citing Acron Invest., Inc. v. Federal Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp., 363 F.2d 
236, 240 (9th Cir. 1966))); Fed. Land Bank v. Cotton, 410 F. Supp. 169, 171 
(N.D. Ga. 1975) (“[C]orporation is not an ‘agency’ unless the government has 
a substantial proprietary interest in it, or at least exercises considerable control 
over operation and policy in the corporation.”); Walton v. Howard, 683 F. Supp. 
826, 830 (D.D.C. 1987) (“The American National Red Cross . . . was not set 
up to perform an essential regulatory function, or an essential function in the 
operation of the national economy, with the federal government maintaining 
primary control of the corporation. . . . [I]t is not subject to the substantial 
federal control that is characteristic of a governmental agency.”).

Whether a company working as a private contractor for the government 
constitutes  a  “department  or  agency  of  the  United  States”  for  purposes  of 
prosecution under subsection (a)(2)(B) has not been addressed by any court. 
However,  the  argument  that  private  contractors  are  intended  to  be  covered 
by  this  section  may  be  undercut  by  section  1030(a)(3),  which  includes 
language permitting prosecution of trespass into government systems and non-
government systems, if “such conduct affects that use by or for the Government 
of the United States.” The existence of this language suggests that if Congress 
had intended to extend the reach of section 1030(a)(2)(B) beyond computers 
owned by the federal government, it would have done so using language it used 
elsewhere in section 1030.

 

Protected Computer

 
The  term  “protected  computer”  is  defined  in  section  1030(e)(2)  and  is 

discussed in the “Key Definitions” discussion on page 4.

 

5.  Penalties
Violations  of  section  1030(a)(2)  are  misdemeanors  punishable  by  a 
fine  or  a  one-year  prison  term  unless  aggravating  factors  apply.  18  U.S.C. 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

19

§ 1030(c)(2)(A).  Merely  obtaining  information  worth  less  than  $5,000  is  a 
misdemeanor, unless committed after a conviction for another offense under 
section 1030, in which case the maximum prison term is 10 years. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(c)(2)(C). A violation or attempted violation of section 1030(a)(2) is a 
felony if:

•	
•	

•	

committed	for	commercial advantage or private financial gain,
committed	in	furtherance	of	any	criminal	or	tortious	act	in	violation	of	
the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State, or 
the	value	of	the	information	obtained	exceeds	$5,000.

18  U.S.C.  § 1030(c)(2)(B).  If  the  aggravating  factors  apply,  a  violation  is 
punishable by a fine, up to five years’ imprisonment, or both.

Any reasonable method can be used to establish the value of the information 
obtained. For example, the research, development, and manufacturing costs 
or the value of the property “in the thieves’ market” can be used to meet the 
$5,000 valuation. See, e.g., United States v. Stegora, 849 F.2d 291, 292 (8th Cir. 
1988). The terms “for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial 
gain” and “for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act” are 
taken from copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 506(a)) and the wiretap statute (18 
U.S.C. § 2511(2)(d)), respectively.

Prosecutors should consider whether the defendant manifested intent to 
commit a state tort, such as invasion of privacy, at the time the information was 
obtained. The phrase “laws of the United States or of any State” unquestionably 
covers state statutory torts. Although defendants may argue that the phrase 
should  be  interpreted  to  refer  only  to  statutory  laws  and  should  not  cover 
state “common law” torts, this argument is incorrect. First, the statute’s plain 
language makes no distinction between statutory and common law. Second, 
at  least  one  district  court  has  held  that  the  phrase  applies  to  common  law 
torts. United States v. Powers, 2010 WL 1418172 (D. Neb. 2010) (slip copy) 
(applying  section  1030(a)(2)  to  Nebraska  torts  of  invasion  of  privacy  and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress). Moreover, the legislative history 
of section 1030 reveals that Congress intended the phrase to have the same 
meaning as identical language under the Wiretap Act, and cases construing 
that language hold the phrase encompasses state common law torts. S. Rep. 
No. 104-357, at 8 (1996), available at 1996 WL 492169, at *8 (“The terms . . . 
‘for  the  purpose  of  committing  any  criminal  or  tortious  act’  .  .  .  are  taken 
from  . . . the wiretap statute . . . and are intended to have the same meaning 

20  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

as th[at] statute.”); see Doe v. Smith, 429 F.3d 706 (7th Cir. 2005); Bowens v. 
Aftermath Entertainment, 254 F. Supp. 2d 629 (E.D. Mich. 2003); Sussman v. 
American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 186 F.3d 1200, 1202 (9th Cir. 1999).
Defendants may also argue that, if the statute covered state common law 
torts then it would federalize and criminalize all common law torts occurring on 
the Internet and usurp state jurisdiction in common law cases. This argument 
is also incorrect. First, defendants may only be charged under section 1030(a)
(2)  when  they  intentionally  accessed  a  computer  without  authorization  or 
exceeded authorized access. See United States v. Sablan, 92 F.3d 865, 869 (9th 
Cir. 1996). Second, the defendant’s access must have been in furtherance of the 
tortious act. See In re Doubleclick Inc. Privacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 
519 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (dismissing claim under section 2511 for lack of evidence 
of “criminal or tortious” purpose). Nonetheless, because it is possible to contest 
the  applicability  of  the  phrase  “laws  of  the  United  States  or  of  any  State,” 
prosecutors should carefully consider reliance on minor or obscure common 
law  torts.  However,  well-recognized  common  law  torts,  such  as  invasion  of 
privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress, will likely succeed. 

 

6.  Historical Notes
Originally, section 1030(a)(2) protected individual privacy by criminalizing 
unauthorized access to computerized information and credit records relating 
to customers’ relationships with financial institutions. See S. Rep. No. 99-432, 
at 6 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2483; see also S. Rep. No. 
104-357, at 7; America Online, Inc. v. National Health Care Discount, Inc., 121 
F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1275 (N.D. Iowa 2000). In 1996, Congress expanded the 
scope of the section by adding two subsections that also protected information 
on government computers (§ 1030(a)(2)(B)) and computers used in interstate 
or foreign communication (§ 1030(a)(2)(C)). 

In 1986, Congress changed the scienter requirement from “knowingly” to 
“intentionally.” See Pub. L. No. 99-474, § 2(a)(1). The first reason for the change 
was to ensure that only intentional acts of unauthorized access were prohibited, 
rather than “mistaken, inadvertent, or careless” acts of unauthorized access. S. 
Rep. No. 99-432, at 5, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2483. The second reason for the 
change was a concern that the “knowingly” standard “might be inappropriate 
for cases involving computer technology.” Id. The specific concern was that 
a  scienter  requirement  of  “knowingly”  might  include  an  individual  “who 
inadvertently ‘stumble[d] into’ someone else’s computer file or computer data,” 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

21

especially where such individual was authorized to use a particular computer. 
Id. at 6, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2483. The Senate Report offered that “[t]he 
substitution of an ‘intentional’ standard is designed to focus Federal criminal 
prosecutions on those whose conduct evinces a clear intent to enter, without 
proper authorization, computer files or data belonging to another.” Id., 1986 
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2484.

Until  2008,  a  violation  of  section  1030(a)(2)(C)  required  an  actual 
interstate or foreign communication. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C) (2007). 
This  limitation  precluded  prosecution  in  serious  cases  where  sensitive  or 
proprietary  information  was  stolen  from  within  a  single  state,  as  is  often 
the case with “insider” thefts. Through the Identity Theft Enforcement and 
Restitution Act, Congress deleted the portion of section 1030(a)(2)(C) that 
required an interstate or foreign communication. Accordingly, the government 
may  now  prosecute  those  who  steal  information  from  a  computer  without 
regard to how or where the criminal gained access to the victim computer, so 
long as that computer constitutes a “protected computer.” In such cases, federal 
jurisdiction  is  founded  on  the  definition  of  “protected  computer”—such  as 
a  computer  owned  by  the  federal  government  or  one  used  in  or  affecting 
interstate commerce—in the same way as other parts of section 1030.

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

D.  Trespassing in a Government Computer: 

18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(3)

Section 1030(a)(3) protects against “trespasses” by outsiders into federal 
government computers, even when no information is obtained during such 
trespasses.  Congress  limited  this  section’s  application  to  outsiders  out  of 
concern  that  federal  employees  could  become  unwittingly  subject  to 
prosecution or punished criminally when 
administrative 
sanctions  were  more 
appropriate.  S.  Rep.  No.  99-432,  at  7, 
reprinted  in  1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2479, 
2485.  However,  Congress 
intended 
interdepartmental  trespasses  (rather  than 
intradepartmental

punishable under section 1030(a)(3). Id.

to 

Note that section 1030(a)(2) applies to many of the same cases in which 
section 1030(a)(3)  could  be  charged.  In  such  cases,  section 1030(a)(2)  may 
be the preferred charge because a first offense of section 1030(a)(2) may be 
charged as a felony if certain aggravating factors are present, while a first offense 
of section 1030(a)(3) is only a misdemeanor.

Title 18, United States Code, Section 1030(a)(3) provides:
Whoever—

(3)  intentionally,  without  authorization  to  access  any  nonpublic 
computer of a department or agency of the United States, accesses such 
a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use 
of the Government of the United States or, in the case of a computer not 
exclusively for such use, is used by or for the Government of the United 
States and such conduct affects that use by or for the Government of the 
United States . . .

shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

 

1.  Intentionally Access
The meaning of this term under this section is identical to the meaning 

under section 1030(a)(2), discussed on page 17.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

23

 

2.  Without Authorization
By requiring that the defendant act without authorization to access the 
computer, section 1030(a)(3) does not apply to situations in which employees 
merely  exceed  authorized  access  to  computers  in  their  own  department.  S. 
Rep. No. 99-432, at 7, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2485. However, 
Congress  apparently  intended  that  section 1030(a)(3)  apply  “where  the 
offender’s act of trespass is interdepartmental in nature.” Id. at 8. Thus, while 
federal employees may not be subject to prosecution under section 1030(a)
(3) as insiders as to their own agency’s computers, they may be eligible for 
prosecution in regard to intrusions into other agencies’ computers. 

Please  see  page  5  for  the  discussion  of  access  without  or  in  excess  of 

authorization.

 

3.  Nonpublic Computer of the United States
“Nonpublic”  includes  most  government  computers,  but  not  Internet 
servers that, by design, offer services to members of the general public. For 
example, a government agency’s database server is probably “nonpublic,” while 
the same agency’s web servers are “public.” 

The  computer  must  be  either  owned  or  controlled  by  a  department  or 
agency of the United States, or at least used “by or for” the government of the 
United States in some capacity. For example, if the United States has obtained 
an account on a private company’s server, that server is used “by” the United 
States even though it is not owned by the United States.

 

4.  Affected United States’ Use of Computer
Demonstrating  that  the  attacked  computer  is  affected  by  an  intrusion 
should  be  relatively  simple.  Almost  any  network  intrusion  will  affect  the 
government’s use of its computers because any intrusion potentially affects the 
confidentiality and integrity of the government’s network and often requires 
substantial  measures  to  assure  the  integrity  of  data  and  the  security  of  the 
network.

Section  1030(a)(3)  “defines  as  a  criminal  violation  the  knowing 
unauthorized access or use of the system for any unauthorized purpose.” Sawyer 
v. Department of Air Force, 31 M.S.P.R. 193, 196 (M.S.P.B. 1986). Notably, 
it is not necessary to demonstrate that the intruder obtained any information 
from the computer or that the intruder’s trespass damaged the computer. It is 

24  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

not even necessary to show that the intruder’s conduct “adversely” affected the 
government’s operation of a computer. Under section 1030(a)(3), there are no 
benign intrusions into government computers.

 

5.  Statutory Penalties
Violations of this section are punishable by a fine and up to one year in 
prison, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(A), unless the individual has previously been 
convicted of a section 1030 offense, in which case the maximum punishment 
increases to ten years in prison, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(c).

 

6.  Relation to Other Statutes
Prosecutors  rarely  charge  section  1030(a)(3)  and  few  cases  interpret  it, 
probably  because  section  1030(a)(2)  applies  in  many  of  the  same  cases  in 
which  section 1030(a)(3)  could  be  charged.  In  such  cases,  section 1030(a)
(2) may be the preferred charge because statutory sentencing enhancements 
may allow section 1030(a)(2) to be charged as a felony on the first offense. A 
violation of section 1030(a)(3), on the other hand, is only a misdemeanor for 
a first offense.
 

7.  Historical Notes
Congress  added  the  term  “nonpublic”  in  1996,  in  recognition  of  the 
occasions  when  a  department  or  agency  authorizes  access  to  some  portions 
of  its  systems  by  the  public,  such  as  websites  and  interactive  services.  This 
addition  eliminated  the  potential  defense  that  intruders  were  not  “without 
authorization  to  access  any  computer”  if  they  had  been  given  authority  to 
access websites and other public networked services offered by the government. 
By adding the word “nonpublic,” Congress clarified that persons who have no 
authority to access nonpublic computers of a department or agency may be 
convicted under section 1030(a)(3), even if they are allowed to access publicly 
available computers. 

During  enactment  of  section 1030(a)(3),  the  Department  of  Justice 
expressed  concern  that  the  section  could  be  interpreted  to  require  that  the 
offender’s conduct harm the overall operation of the government, which would 
be an exceedingly difficult showing for federal prosecutors. Congress responded 
in 1996 by drafting section 1030(a)(3) so that an offender’s conduct need only 
affect the use of the government’s operation of the attacked computer rather 
than affect the government as a whole. See S. Rep. No. 99-432 (1986), reprinted 
in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479.

18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)

When  deciding  how  to  charge  a 
computer hacking case, prosecutors should 
consider  this  subsection  as  an  alternative 
to subsection 1030(a)(2) when evidence of 
fraud  exists,  particularly  because  offenses 
under  this  section  are  felonies  whereas 
offenses  under 
(a)(2)  are 
misdemeanors (unless certain aggravating 
factors apply).

2.  with intent to defraud
3.  access furthered the intended fraud
4.  obtained anything of value,
 

including use if value exceeded 
$5000

Prosecutors may also want to consider charges under the wire fraud statute, 
18 U.S.C. § 1343, which requires proof of many elements similar to those 
needed for section 1030(a)(4) but carries stiffer penalties. For more detail on 
the  comparison,  please  see  page  34.  For  more  discussion  about  wire  fraud, 
please see page 109.

Title 18, United State Code, Section 1030(a)(4) provides:
Whoever—

(4) knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer 
without  authorization,  or  exceeds  authorized  access,  and  by  means 
of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of 
value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only 
of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than 
$5,000 in any 1-year period . . .

shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
Although  section  1030(a)(4)  bears  similarities  to  the  federal  mail  fraud 
statute (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and wire fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1343), section 
1030(a)(4) does not have the same broad jurisdictional sweep as the mail and 
wire fraud statutes. See S. Rep. No. 99-432, at 9 (1986), reprinted in 1986 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2487 (“It has been suggested that the Committee approach 
all  computer  fraud  in  a  manner  that  directly  tracks  the  existing  mail  fraud 
and wire fraud statutes. However, the Committee was concerned that such an 
approach might permit prosecution under this subsection of acts that do not 
deserve classification as ‘computer fraud.’”). The specific concern expressed was 
“that computer usage that is wholly extraneous to an intended fraud might 

26  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

nevertheless  be  covered  by  this  subsection  if  the  subsection  were  patterned 
directly after the current mail fraud and wire fraud laws.” Id. As a result, section 
1030(a)(4) includes the requirement, without analogy in the mail and wire 
fraud statutes, that computer usage be of a protected computer and without or 
in excess of authorization. See id. (“To be prosecuted under [section 1030(a)
(4)], the use of the computer must be more directly linked to the intended 
fraud. That is, it must be used by the offender without authorization or in excess 
of his authorization to obtain property of another, which property furthers the 
intended fraud.”). Of course, most computer crimes involving fraud also make 
use of a “wire,” making it possible to charge section 1343 as well.

 

1.  Knowingly Access Without or In Excess of Authorization
Please see page 5 for the discussion of access and authorization.

 

2.  With Intent to Defraud
The  phrase  “knowingly  and  with  intent  to  defraud”  is  not  defined  by 
section 1030. Very little case law under section 1030 exists as to its meaning, 
leaving open the question of how broadly a court will interpret the phrase. 
When Congress added this subsection in 1986, a Senate cosponsor’s comments 
suggested  that  Congress  intended  section  1030(a)(4)  to  punish  attempts  to 
steal valuable data and not to punish mere unauthorized access:

The acts of fraud we are addressing in proposed section 1030(a)
(4)  are  essentially  thefts  in  which  someone  uses  a  federal 
interest computer to wrongly obtain something of value from 
another. . . . Proposed section 1030(a)(4) is intended to reflect 
the distinction between the theft of information, a felony, and 
mere unauthorized access, a misdemeanor.

132  Cong.  Rec.  7128,  7129,  99th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  (1986).  The  Senate 
Committee Report further emphasizes the fact that section 1030(a)(4) should 
apply to those who steal information through unauthorized access as part of 
an illegal scheme:

The Committee remains convinced that there must be a clear 
distinction  between  computer  theft,  punishable  as  a  felony 
[under  this  section],  and  computer  trespass,  punishable  in 
the first instance as a misdemeanor. The element in the new 
paragraph (a)(4), requiring a showing of an intent to defraud, 
is meant to preserve that distinction, as is the requirement that 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

27

the  property  wrongfully  obtained  via  computer  furthers  the 
intended fraud.

S. Rep. No. 99-432, at 10, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2488.

Congress also specifically noted that “[t]he scienter requirement for this 
subsection, ‘knowingly and with intent to defraud,’ is the same as the standard 
used for 18 U.S.C. [section] 1029 relating to credit card fraud.” See S. Rep. 
No. 99-432, at 10, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2488. Interestingly, 
despite having specifically discussed the mail and wire fraud statutes in the 
context  of  section  1030(a)(4),  the  Committee  did  not  relate  the  scienter 
requirement of the term “to defraud” to the use of the same term in the mail 
and wire fraud statutes, leaving open the question of whether the meaning and 
proof of “to defraud” is the same for sections 1030(a)(4) and 1029 as it is for 
the mail and wire fraud statutes. As it is, no reported cases discuss the meaning 
of “to defraud” under section 1029.

The courts’ treatment of wire fraud and mail fraud, however, is instructive. 
The Supreme Court has recognized that the mail and wire fraud statutes sweep 
more broadly than the common law definition of fraud and false pretenses. 
Durland v. United States, 161 U.S. 306, 313-14 (1896).5 However, the Court 
also  rejected  the  notion  that  every  “scheme  or  artifice  that  in  its  necessary 
consequence is one which is calculated to injure another [or] to deprive him 
of his property wrongfully” constitutes fraud under the mail fraud provision. 
Fasulo v. United States, 272 U.S. 620, 629 (1926). Fasulo examined the outer 
limits of the phrase “to defraud,” determining that “broad as are the words ‘to 
defraud,’ they do not include threat and coercion through fear or force.” Id. 
at 628. Instead, the Supreme Court placed emphasis on the central role of 
deception to the concept of fraud—“the words ‘to defraud’ . . . primarily mean 
to cheat, . . . usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, 
deceit, chicane, or overreaching, and . . . do not extend to theft by violence, or 
to robbery or burglary.” Id. at 627 (construing Hammerschmidt v. United States, 
265 U.S. 182 (1924)).

The Supreme Court held that the mail and wire fraud statutes incorporate 
the materiality requirement of common-law fraud. See Neder v. United States, 
527  U.S.  1,  22-23  (1999)  (extending  common-law  fraud’s  requirement  of 

5 Identical standards apply to the “scheme to defraud” under both the mail and the wire 

 
fraud statutes. See United States v. Antico, 275 F.3d 245 (3d Cir. 2001).

28  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

misrepresentation or concealment of material fact to wire fraud and mail fraud 
statutes). However, the Court recognized that the mail and wire fraud statutes 
did  not  incorporate  all  the  elements  of  common-law  fraud,  but  only  those 
elements not clearly inconsistent with the statutory language. See id. at 24-25 
(acknowledging  that  the  common-law  requirements  of  “justifiable  reliance” 
and  “damages”  are  clearly  inconsistent  with  and  therefore  have  no  place  in 
federal mail and wire fraud statutes which prohibit the “scheme to defraud” 
rather than the completed fraud); see also Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 
U.S. 451, 476 (2006).

In  the  context  of  the  Computer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Act,  district  courts 
addressing the issue have held that, as in wire and mail fraud cases, there is no 
need to plead the elements of common law fraud. In Shurgard Storage Centers, 
Inc. v. Safeguard Self Storage, Inc., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1123 (W.D. Wash. 
2000), a civil case involving section 1030(a)(4), the court favored an expansive 
interpretation of “intent to defraud.” In denying the defendant’s motion to 
dismiss, the court held that the word “fraud” as used in section 1030(a)(4) 
simply means “wrongdoing” and does not require proof of the common law 
elements of fraud. Id. at 1126 (construing United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 
1069,  1078  (1st  Cir.  1997)).  Thus,  the  plaintiff  stated  a  sufficient  cause  of 
action under section 1030(a)(4) by alleging that the defendant participated in 
“dishonest methods to obtain the plaintiff’s secret information.” Id. Shurgard 
does not directly address the Supreme Court’s decisions in the mail or wire 
fraud contexts, but nevertheless provides some basis for interpreting “fraud” in 
its broadest sense (i.e., finding “fraud” when there is evidence of “wrongdoing,” 
as opposed to requiring proof of “trick, deceit, chicane, or overreaching”). See 
also  Hanger  Prosthetics  &  Orthotics,  Inc.  v.  Capstone  Orthopedic,  Inc., 556 F. 
Supp. 2d 1122, 1131 (E.D. Cal. 2008) (citing Shurgard); eBay Inc. v. Digital 
Point Solutions, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 1156, 1164 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (citing 
Hanger).

However, merely browsing information which does not produce anything 
of value does not qualify as a “scheme to defraud.” United States v. Czubinski, 
106  F.3d  1069  (1st  Cir.  1997)  (defendant’s  unauthorized  browsing  of 
confidential  taxpayer  information  in  which  he  did  not  obtain  “anything  of 
value” did not constitute the statutory crime of computer fraud because he 
did not defraud Internal Revenue Service of its property within meaning of 18 
U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)).

3.  Access Furthered the Intended Fraud
The defendant’s illegal access of the protected computer must “further” a 
fraud. Accessing a computer without authorization—or, more often, exceeding 
authorized access—can further a fraud in several ways. For example:

•	 This	element	is	met	if	a	defendant	alters	or	deletes	records	on	a	computer	
and then receives something of value from an individual who relied 
on the accuracy of those altered or deleted records. In United States v. 
Butler, 16 Fed. Appx. 99 (4th Cir. 2001) (unpublished), the defendant 
altered a credit reporting agency’s records to improve the credit ratings 
of his coconspirators, who then used their improved credit ratings to 
make purchases. In United States v. Sadolsky, 234 F.3d 938 (6th Cir. 
2000), the defendant used his employer’s computer to credit amounts 
for returned merchandise to his personal credit card.

•	 This	 element	 is	 met	 if	 a	 defendant	 obtains	 information	 from	 a	
computer and then later uses that information to commit fraud. For 
example, in United States v. Lindsley, 2001 WL 502832 (5th Cir. 2001) 
(unpublished), the defendant accessed a telephone company’s computer 
without authorization, obtained calling card numbers, and then used 
those calling card numbers to make free long-distance telephone calls.
•	 This	element	is	met	if	a	defendant	uses	a	computer	to	produce	falsified	
documents that are later used to defraud. For example, in United States 
v. Bae, 250 F.3d 774 (D.C. Cir. 2001), the defendant used a lottery 
terminal to produce backdated tickets with winning numbers and then 
turned those tickets in to collect lottery prizes.

The courts have found an increasingly wide range of activities punishable 
under  the  mail  and  wire  fraud  statutes.  See  United  States  v.  McNeive,  536 
F.2d 1245, 1248-49 (1976) (listing cases covered under mail and wire fraud 
statutes, including false insurance claims, cheating investors, false odometer 
schemes, and check kiting schemes). Courts have interpreted section 1341 and 
section 1343 expansively to cover not only schemes to defraud individuals of 
money or property, but also schemes to defraud individuals of “intangible” 
interests and rights. See United States v. Newman, 664 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1981) 
(employer’s interest in confidential information); United States v. Bronston, 658 
F.2d 920, 927 (2d Cir. 1981) (client’s right to “undivided loyalty” of attorney); 
United States v. Von Barta, 635 F.2d 999 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 
998 (1981) (employer’s right to the honest and faithful service of employees);

United  States  v.  Bohonus,  628  F.2d  1167  (9th  Cir.  1980),  cert.  denied,  447 
U.S. 928 (1980) (same); United States v. Condolon, 600 F.2d 7 (4th Cir. 1979) 
(“time, effort and expectations”); United States v. Louderman, 576 F.2d 1383 
(9th  Cir.  1978),  cert.  denied,  439  U.S.  896  (1978)  (privacy  rights);  United 
States v. Bush, 522 F.2d 641 (7th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 977 (1976) 
(citizen’s right to honest services of municipal employee); United States v. States, 
488 F.2d 761, 765 (8th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 909 (1974) (“certain 
intangible political rights”); Shushan v. United States, 117 F.2d 110 (5th Cir. 
1941), cert. denied, 313 U.S. 574 (1941) (public’s right to a public official’s 
honest,  faithful,  and  disinterested  services). While  the  Supreme  Court  held 
that intangible rights did not receive protection as property rights under the 
mail fraud statute, see McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), Congress 
amended  the  act  to  affirm  that  the  statute  does  protect  such  rights.  See  18 
U.S.C. § 1346 (expanding the definition of scheme or artifice to defraud in 
both the mail and wire fraud statutes to include schemes to deprive individuals 
of “honest services”).

Some schemes involve not only fraud, but also the theft and alteration of 
confidential information through unauthorized access of computers. See, e.g., 
United States v. Scheier, 908 F.2d 645, 646 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 
U.S. 1069 (1991) (holding that defendants were in violation of section 1343 
for  accessing  American  Airlines’  computer  reservation  system  and  altering 
information therein); United States v. Riggs, 739 F. Supp. 414 (N.D. Ill. 1990) 
(holding that defendants were in violation of section 1343 when they gained 
unauthorized access to Bell South’s emergency computer file and schemed to 
defraud Bell South of property).

The term “by means of such conduct” explicitly links the unauthorized 
accessing  of  a  protected  computer  to  the  furthering  of  the  intended  fraud. 
In creating this link, Congress wished to distinguish those cases of computer 
trespass  where  the  trespass  is  used  to  further  the  fraud  (covered  by  section 
1030(a)(4)) from those cases of fraud that involve a computer but the computer 
is only tangential to the crime (not covered by section 1030(a)(4)). See S. Rep. 
No. 99-432, at 9, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2487. 

In order to fall within section 1030(a)(4), “the use of the computer must 
be more directly linked to the intended fraud.” Id. The section does not apply 
simply because “the offender signed onto a computer at some point near to 
the commission or execution of the fraud.” Id. More explicitly, a fraudulent 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

31

scheme does not constitute computer fraud just because a computer was used 
“to keep records or to add up [the] potential ‘take’ from the crime.” Id. 

 

4.  Obtains Anything of Value
This  element  is  easily  met  if  the  defendant  obtained  money,  cash,  or  a 
good or service with measurable value. Two cases that are more difficult arise 
(1) when the defendant obtains only the use of a computer, and (2) when the 
defendant obtains only information.

 

  Use of the computer as a thing of value
The statute recognizes that the use of a computer can constitute a thing of 
value, but this element is satisfied only if the value of such use is greater than 
$5,000 in any one-year period.

At the time the statute was written, it was common for owners of top-of-
the-line supercomputers to rent the right to run programs on their computers 
by  the  hour.  In  1986,  for  example,  an  hour  of  time  on  a  Cray  X-MP/48 
supercomputer reportedly cost $1,000. William F. Eddy, Rejoinder, Statistical 
Science, Nov. 1986, 451, 453. Conceivably, repeated and sustained use of an 
expensive modern computer could reach the statutory threshold within one 
year. 

 

  Data or information as a thing of value
Aside  from  the  “computer  use”  exception,  subsection  (a)(4)  has  no 
minimum dollar amount. Still, the legislative history suggests that obtaining 
some computer data or information, alone, is not valuable enough to qualify. 
See S. Rep. 99-432, at 9, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2487) (“In 
intentionally  trespassing  into  someone  else’s  computer  files,  the  offender 
obtains at the very least information as to how to break into that computer 
system. If that is all he obtains, the offense should properly be treated as a 
simple trespass.”).

One  case  involving  the  mere  viewing  of  information  is  United  States  v. 
Czubinski,  106  F.3d  1069  (1st  Cir.  1997).  While  Czubinski  turned  on  its 
specific facts and was decided before Congress amended section 1030(a)(2) 
to cover obtaining information from a department or agency of the United 
States,  the  court’s  discussion  may  be  instructive  in  assessing  the  parameters 
of the term “something of value.” Specifically, Czubinski was employed as a 
Contact Representative in the Boston office of the Taxpayer Services Division 

32  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As part of his official duties, Czubinski 
routinely accessed taxpayer-related information from an IRS computer system 
using a valid password provided to Contact Representatives. Despite IRS rules 
plainly forbidding employees from accessing taxpayer files outside the course 
of their official duties, Czubinski carried out numerous unauthorized searches 
of taxpayer records on a number of occasions. Based upon these actions, he 
was indicted and convicted for wire fraud and computer fraud. Id. at 1071-72.
On  appeal,  Czubinski  argued  that  his  conviction  for  violating  section 
1030(a)(4) should be overturned because he did not obtain “anything of value.” 
In reviewing the facts surrounding Czubinski’s actions, the First Circuit agreed 
with  Czubinski,  stating  that  “[t]he  value  of  information  is  relative  to  one’s 
needs and objectives; here, the government had to show that the information 
was valuable to Czubinski in light of a fraudulent scheme. The government 
failed, however, to prove that Czubinski intended anything more than to satisfy 
idle curiosity.” Id. at 1078.

Further elaborating on its holding, the court went on to explain that: 

[t]he  plain  language  of  section  1030(a)(4)  emphasizes  that 
more  than  mere  unauthorized  use  is  required:  the  “thing 
obtained” may not merely be the unauthorized use. It is the 
showing of some additional end—to which the unauthorized 
access is a means—that is lacking here. The evidence did not 
show that Czubinski’s end was anything more than to satisfy his 
curiosity by viewing information about friends, acquaintances, 
and political rivals. No evidence suggests that he printed out, 
recorded,  or  used  the  information  he  browsed.  No  rational 
jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski 
intended  to  use  or  disclose  that  information,  and  merely 
viewing information cannot be deemed the same as obtaining 
something of value for the purposes of this statute.

Id.6 

The parameters of what constitutes a “thing of value” were further explored 
in In re America Online, Inc., 168 F. Supp. 2d 1359 (S.D. Fla. 2001). Specifically, 
America Online (AOL) was sued by computer users and competitor Internet 
service  providers,  alleging  that  AOL’s  software  had  caused  damage  to  users’ 

6 As a result of a statutory amendment, Czubinski’s conduct could now be charged as a 

 
violation of subsection 1030(a)(2) (exceeding authorized access and obtaining information).

computers and had blocked utilization of competitors’ software by potential 
users. Id. In moving to dismiss the section 1030(a)(4) allegation, AOL argued 
that the plaintiffs could not make out an actionable claim because they had 
failed to plead that AOL had deprived them of “anything of value.” Id. at 1379. 
In response, the plaintiffs asserted that AOL’s actions had deprived them of 
their subscribers “custom and trade” and that this interest constituted a “thing 
of value.” Id.

In distinguishing the case from Czubinski, the America Online court noted 
that “AOL allegedly has been motivated by more than the mere satisfaction of 
its curiosity [as was allegedly the sole motivation of the defendant in Czubinski]. 
AOL’s alleged end is to obtain a monopoly, or at least secure its stronghold, as 
an ISP.” America Online at 1379-80. Noting that the “typical item of value” in 
cases brought under the CFAA is usually data, the court observed that “in other 
areas of the law, customers have been found to be a thing of value.” Id. at 1380. 
The court therefore found that “damage to an ISP’s goodwill and reputation is 
actionable under the CFAA” and that “[b]ecause [the plaintiff] has alleged that 
AOL’s actions have interfered with its relationships with its existing customers 
and potential subscribers, it has alleged that AOL has obtained something of 
value within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4).” Id. 

 

5.  Statutory Penalties
A violation of section 1030(a)(4) is punishable by a fine and up to five 
years in prison, unless the individual has been previously convicted of a section 
1030 offense, in which case the maximum punishment increases to ten years 
in prison. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(3).

 

6.  Relation to Other Statutes
In appropriate cases, prosecutors may also want to consider charges under 
the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which requires proof of many elements 
similar to those needed for section 1030(a)(4). Please see page 109 for more 
on section 1343. However, unlike section 1030(a)(4), which is punishable by 
a maximum of 5 years in prison (assuming the defendant does not have prior 
section 1030 convictions), wire fraud carries stiffer penalties and is punishable 
by a maximum of 20 years in prison, or 30 years if the violation affected a 
financial institution. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4) with 18 U.S.C. § 1343.

Criminals  can  cause  damage  to  computers  in  a  wide  variety  of  ways. 
For example, an intruder who gains unauthorized access to a computer can 
send commands that delete files or shuts the computer down. Intruders can 
initiate a “denial of service attack” that floods the victim computer with useless 
information and prevents legitimate users from accessing it. A virus or worm 
can  use  up  all  of  the  available  communications  bandwidth  on  a  corporate 
network, making it unavailable to employees. When a virus or worm penetrates 
a computer’s security, it can delete files, crash the computer, install malicious 
software, or do other things that impair the computer’s integrity. Prosecutors 
can use section 1030(a)(5) to charge all of these different kinds of acts.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

35

Title 18, United State Code, Section 1030(a)(5) provides:
Whoever—

(5)(A) knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information, 
code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally causes 
damage without authorization, to a protected computer;
(B) intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, 
and as a result of such conduct, recklessly causes damage; or
(C) intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, 
and as a result of such conduct, causes damage and loss . . .
shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
Section 1030(a)(5) criminalizes a variety of actions that cause computer 
systems to fail to operate as their owners would like them to operate. Damaging 
a computer can have far-reaching effects. For example, a business may not be 
able to operate if its computer system stops functioning or it may lose sales 
if it cannot retrieve the data in a database containing customer information. 
Similarly, if a computer that operates the phone system used by police and 
fire fighters stops functioning, people could be injured or die as a result of not 
receiving emergency services. Such damage to a computer can occur following 
a successful intrusion, but it may also occur in ways that do not involve the 
unauthorized access of a computer system.

At their basic level, all three of these subsections are misdemeanors. If the 
intruder causes sufficient loss or other specified harms, the penalties increase 
to  felonies  for  subsections  (a)(5)(A)  and  (a)(5)(B).  The  differences  between 
the conduct criminalized by the three subsections of section 1030(a)(5) vary 
depending on the mental state of the attackers and their ability to access the 
victim  computer.  In  basic  terms,  subsection  (5)(A)  prohibits  anyone  from 
intentionally damaging a computer (without authorization) while subsection 
(5)(B)  prohibits  unauthorized  users  from  causing  damage  recklessly  and 
subsection (5)(C) from causing damage (and loss) negligently.

The latter two subsections require that the defendant “access” the computer 
without authorization. These criminal prohibitions hold intruders accountable 
for any damage they cause while intentionally trespassing on a computer, even 
if they did not intend to cause that damage. See S. Rep. No. 104-357, at 11 
(1996),  available  at  1996  WL  492169  (“Anyone  who  knowingly  invades  a 

36  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

system without authority and causes significant loss to the victim should be 
punished . . . even when the damage caused is not intentional.”). 

By  contrast,  section 1030(a)(5)(A)  requires  proof  only  of  the  knowing 
transmission  of  data,  a  command,  or  software  to  intentionally  damage  a 
computer  without  authorization.  The  government  does  not  need  to  prove 
“access.” Because it is possible to damage a computer without “accessing” it, 
this element is easier to prove (except for the mental state requirement). For 
example, where an attacker floods an Internet connection with data during a 
denial of service attack, the damage is intentional even though the attacker 
never accesses the site.

 

1.  The Transmission or Access Element

Subsection (a)(5)(A): Knowingly causing the transmission of a program, 
information, code, or command to a protected computer

Section 1030(a)(5)(A) prohibits knowingly causing the transmission of a 
“program, information, code, or command” and as a result of such conduct, 
intentionally causing damage to a protected computer. This subsection applies 
equally to offenders who are authorized to use the victim computer system (an 
“insider”), to those not authorized to use it (an “outsider”), and to those who 
have never accessed the system at all.

The term “program, information, code, or command” broadly covers all 
transmissions that are capable of having an effect on a computer’s operation. 
This includes software code (such as a worm), software commands (such as an 
instruction to delete information), and network packets designed to flood a 
network connection or exploit system vulnerabilities.

In the ordinary case where the attacker releases a worm or initiates a denial 
of service attack, the government should easily meet this element of the crime. 
On the other hand, this subsection likely does not apply to “physical” acts that 
shut down a computer, such as flipping a switch to cut off the electrical supply, 
because they do not involve transmission of a program or command. Other 
criminal statutes may cover such conduct, however. 

An attacker need not directly send the required transmission to the victim 
computer  in  order  to  violate  this  statute.  In  one  case,  a  defendant  inserted 
malicious  code  into  a  software  program  he  wrote  to  run  on  his  employer’s 
computer  network.  United  States  v.  Sullivan,  40  Fed.  Appx.  740  (4th  Cir. 
2002) (unpublished). After lying dormant for four months, the malicious code 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

37

activated  and  downloaded  certain  other  malicious  code  to  several  hundred 
employee handheld computers, making them unusable. Id. at 741. The court 
held that the defendant knowingly caused transmission of code in violation of 
the statute. Id. at 743.

In  the  civil  context,  courts  have  taken  the  idea  of  transmission  of  code 
even  further.  In  International  Airport  Centers,  LLC  v.  Citrin,  440  F.3d  418, 
419-20 (7th Cir. 2006), the Seventh Circuit held that a civil complaint stated 
a claim when it alleged that the defendant copied a secure-erasure program to 
his (company-issued) laptop, and even said in dicta that it made no difference 
if  the  defendant  copied  the  program  over  an  Internet  connection,  from  an 
external  disk  drive,  or  an  internal  disk  drive.  Similarly,  in  Shaw  v. Toshiba 
America Information Systems, 91 F. Supp. 2d 926, 931 (E.D. Tex. 1999), Toshiba 
manufactured computers with faulty software that improperly deleted data on 
diskettes used in their floppy drives, and Toshiba shipped the computers in 
interstate commerce. In that case, the court found that the shipment of the 
software by itself constituted transmission for purposes of the statute. Id.7

Subsections (a)(5)(B) or (C): Intentionally accessed a protected computer 
without authorization

Subsections  1030(a)(5)(B)  and  (C)  require  proof  that  the  defendant 
intentionally  accessed  a  protected  computer  without  authorization.  These 
subsections do not include the phrase “exceeds authorized access.” Compare 18 
U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) & (a)(4) with 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(B) & (C). Thus, 
these subsections do not apply to authorized users of a computer who exceed 
their authorization.

Please see page 5 for the discussion of access without authorization.

 

2.  The Damage Element
Section  1030(a)(5)  prohibits  damaging  a  computer  system.  18  U.S.C. 
§ 1030(a)(5)(A)-(C). The statute requires only that the defendant’s conduct 
“cause” damage in a computer. It is not necessary to prove that the damaged 
computer was the same computer that the defendant accessed. “Damage” is 
defined as “any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, 
a system, or information.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8). Although this definition is 

7 Congress later amended § 1030 so that “no [civil] action may be brought . . . for the 
negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, computer software, or firmware.” 18 
U.S.C. § 1030(g). 

38  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

broad and inclusive, as the use of the word “any” suggests, the definition differs 
in some ways from the idea of damage to physical property. This definition 
contains  several  concepts  that  allow  section 1030(a)(5)  to  apply  to  a  wide 
variety of situations.

First,  “damage”  occurs  when  an  act  impairs  the  “integrity”  of  data,  a 
program, a system, or information. This part of the definition would apply, 
for example, where an act causes data or information to be deleted or changed, 
such as where an intruder accesses a computer system and deletes log files or 
changes entries in a bank database. 

Similarly, “damage” occurs when an intruder changes the way a computer 
is instructed to operate. For example, installing keylogger software on a home 
computer  can  constitute  damage.  Damage  also  occurs  if  an  intruder  alters 
the security software of a victim computer so that it fails to detect computer 
trespassers. In United States v. Middleton, 231 F.3d 1207, 1213-14 (9th Cir. 
2000),  for  example,  part  of  the  damage  consisted  of  a  user  increasing  his 
permissions on a computer system without authorization. 

In addition to the impairment of the integrity of information or computer 
systems, the definition of damage also includes acts that simply make information 
or computers “unavailable.” Intruders have devised ways to consume all of a 
computer’s  computational  resources,  effectively  making  it  impossible  for 
authorized users to make use of the computer even though none of the data 
or software on the victim computer has been modified. Similarly, a “denial 
of service attack” can flood a computer’s Internet connection with junk data, 
preventing legitimate users from sending or receiving any communications with 
that computer. See YourNetDating v. Mitchell, 88 F. Supp. 2d 870, 871 (N.D. 
Ill. 2000) (granting temporary restraining order where defendant installed code 
on plaintiff’s web server that diverted certain users trying to access plaintiff’s 
website to pornography website). 

The following examples may help to illustrate this point.
Example  1:  Prior  to  the  annual  football  game  between  rival  schools,  an 
intruder from one high school gains access to the computer system of a rival 
school and defaces the football team’s website with graffiti announcing that the 
intruder’s school was going to win the game.
In  this  example,  the  intruder  has  caused  damage—the  integrity  of  the 
information on the website has been impaired because viewers of the site will 
not see the information that the site’s designers put there.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

39

Example 2: An attacker configures several thousand computers to access the 
washingtonpost.com website at the same time in a coordinated denial of service 
attack. As a consequence, the site is jammed, and for approximately 45 minutes, 
ordinary web surfers find that the site will not load when they type its URL into 
their browsers. 
This example also shows damage as defined by the CFAA. The attacker has, 
via a code or command, impaired the availability of the data on the website to 
its normal users.

A  computer  network  intrusion—even  a  fairly  noticeable  one—can 
amount to a kind of trespass that causes no readily discoverable impairment 
to the computers intruded upon or the data accessed. Even so, such “trespass 
intrusions”  often  require  that  substantial  time  and  attention  be  devoted  to 
responding to them. In the wake of seemingly minor intrusions, the entire 
computer system is often audited, for instance, to ensure that viruses, back-
doors,  or  other  harmful  codes  have  not  been  left  behind  or  that  data  has 
not been altered or copied. In addition, holes exploited by the intruder are 
sometimes patched, and the network generally is resecured through a rigorous 
and time-consuming technical effort. 

Example 3: The system administrator of a community college reviews server 
logs one morning and notes an unauthorized intrusion that occurred through 
a backdoor at about 3:30 in the morning. It appears to the administrator that 
the intruder accessed a student database that listed students’ home addresses, 
phone numbers, and social security numbers. After calling the FBI, she and 
her staff spend several hours reviewing what occurred, devising patches for the 
vulnerabilities  that  the  intruder  exploited,  and  otherwise  trying  to  prevent 
similar intrusions from occurring again. Still, the result of the technical review 
is that no offending code can be found, and the network appears to function 
as before. In the two months after the intrusion, staff at the community college 
report no known alterations or errors in the student database. The cost of the 
employee time devoted to the review totaled approximately $7,500.
Although  the  intruder  apparently  did  not  make  any  alterations  to  the 
database and the system seems to work as it did before, in a few civil cases 
courts have held that accessing and copying private data may cause damage to 
the data under the CFAA.8 See Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. v. Safeguard Self 
Storage, Inc., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1126-27 (W.D. Wash. 2000).

 

8 This theory has not been applied in a criminal case. In civil cases, the plaintiff must

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

In  Shurgard  Storage  Centers,  a  self-storage  company  hired  away  a  key 
employee  of  its  main  competitor.  Before  the  employee  left  to  take  his  new 
job, he emailed copies of computer files containing trade secrets to his new 
employer. In support of a motion for summary judgment as to the section 
1030(a)(5) count, the defendant argued that the plaintiff’s computer system 
had suffered no “damage” as a consequence of a mere copying of files by the 
disloyal employee. The court, however, found the term “integrity” contextually 
ambiguous and held that the employee did in fact impair the integrity of the 
data on the system—even though no data was “physically changed or erased” 
in the process—when he accessed a computer system without authorization to 
collect trade secrets. Id.

Courts  have  made  similar  rulings  in  HUB  Group,  Inc.  v.  Clancy,  2006 
WL 208684 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (downloading employer’s customer database to 
a thumb drive for use at a future employer created sufficient damage to state 
claim under the CFAA), and I.M.S. Inquiry Management Systems v. Berkshire 
Information Systems, 307 F. Supp. 2d 521, 525-26 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (allegation 
that  the  integrity  of  copyrighted  data  system  was  impaired  by  defendant’s 
copying was sufficient to plead cause of action under CFAA).

 

3.  Loss
For section 1030(a)(5)(C) violations only, the statute also requires that the 
defendant’s conduct cause “loss,” which the statute defines as “any reasonable 
cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting 
a damage assessment, and restoring data, program, system, or information to 
its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other 
consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.” 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(e)(11). See subsection 4, below, for further discussion of “loss.”

 

4.  Harm
In order to prove a felony violation of subsections (a)(5)(A) or (a)(5)(B), 
the government must prove any of the following harms: (1) at least $5,000 loss 
during a one-year period; (2) an actual or potential effect on medical care; (3) 

prove damage under factors listed in section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I)-(V). See page 42 for a list of 
these factors. Civil plaintiffs do not have section 1030(a)(2) available to them. Therefore, the 
flexibility courts have shown toward the definition of damage in civil cases may not apply to 
criminal cases. Further, the trade-secret aspect of Shurgard may limit its applicability. Prosecu-
tors should apply this theory with caution in any criminal prosecution.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

physical injury to a person; (4) a threat to public health or safety; (5) damage to 
a computer used in the administration of justice, national defense, or national 
security; or (6) damage affecting ten or more protected computers during any 
one-year period. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(c)(4)(A)(i), 1030(c)(4)(B)(i).

Loss includes

Under  prior  iterations  of  the  statute,  the  government  had  to  prove  a 
defendant’s conduct resulted in one of the first five harms listed above in order 
to prove a section 1030(a)(5) violation. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(B) (2007). 
As a result, the government was unable to prosecute a criminal who damaged 
a protected computer but failed to cause 
$5,000 of loss or another of the specified 
damages. 
Identity  Theft 
Enforcement  and  Restitution  Act  of 
2008,  Congress  restructured  section 
1030(a)(5)  and  its  associated  penalty 
provisions.  Under  the  amended  text, 
criminals  who  cause  damage  but  who 
do not satisfy the thresholds previously 
enumerated  in  section  1030(a)(5)(B) 
may  still  be  prosecuted  and,  upon 
conviction,  sentenced  to  a  maximum 
one-year term in prison.

In addition, under the 2008 amendment, causing damage to ten or more 
computers became a sixth circumstance in which a violation of section 1030(a)
(5)(A)  or  (B)  constitutes  a  felony.  Prosecutors  can  utilize  this  change  when 
charging violations involving botnets and other cases in which criminals install 
malicious spyware on numerous individual computers.

 

$5,000 Loss

 
Of these enumerated harms, prosecutors most commonly charge loss. The 
statute defines “loss” quite broadly: “any reasonable cost to any victim, including 
the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and 
restoring data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the 
offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages 
incurred because of interruption of service.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11). This 
definition includes, for example, the prorated salary of a system administrator 
who restores a backup of deleted data, the prorated hourly wage of an employee 
who checks a database to make sure that no information in it has been modified, 

42  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

the expense of re-creating lost work, the cost of reinstalling system software, 
and the cost of installing security measures to resecure the computer to avoid 
further  damage  from  the  offender.  See  United  States  v.  Middleton,  231  F.3d 
1207, 1213-14 (9th Cir. 2000) (interpreting § 1030(a)(5) before addition of 
the definition of damage); see also EF Cultural Travel BV v. Explorica, Inc., 274 
F.3d 577, 584 n.17 (1st Cir. 2001) (awarding costs of assessing damage); United 
States v. Sablan, 92 F.3d 865, 869-70 (9th Cir. 1996) (in calculating “loss” for 
purposes of earlier version of sentencing guidelines, court properly included 
standard hourly rate for employees’ time, computer time, and administrative 
overhead); see also I.M.S. Inquiry Management Systems v. Berkshire Information 
Systems, 307 F. Supp. 2d 521, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (awarding costs related to 
“damage assessment and remedial measures”).

“Loss” also includes such harms as lost advertising revenue or lost sales due 
to a website outage and the salaries of company employees who are unable to 
work due to a computer shutdown. See Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 126 F. 
Supp. 2d 238, 252 n.12 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff’d, 356 F.3d 393 (2d Cir. 2004) 
(suggesting, under pre-2001 version of § 1030(a)(5), that lost goodwill and 
lost profits could properly be included in loss calculations where they result 
from damage to a computer). However, the cost of installing completely new 
security measures “unrelated to preventing further damage resulting from [the 
offender’s] conduct,” should not be included in the loss total. See Middleton, 
231  F.3d  at  1213;  see  also  Thurmond  v.  Compaq  Computer  Corp.,  171  F. 
Supp. 2d 667, 680-83 (E.D. Tex. 2001) (cost of hiring outside consultant to 
analyze damage “solely in preparation of litigation” may not be included in 
loss calculation (based on pre-amendment statutory text)). Prosecutors should 
think creatively about what sorts of harms in a particular situation meet this 
definition and work with victims to measure and document all of these losses.
At  least  one  court  has  held  that  harm  to  a  company’s  reputation  and 
goodwill  as  a  consequence  of  an  intrusion  might  properly  be  considered 
loss for purposes of alleging a violation of section 1030. See America Online, 
Inc. v. LCGM, Inc., 46 F. Supp. 2d 444, 451 (E.D. Va. 1998). But cf. In re 
DoubleClick Inc. Privacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 525 n.34 (S.D.N.Y. 
2001) (stating that America Online is “unpersuasive” and that reputation and 
goodwill “seem[] far removed from the damage Congress sought to punish and 
remedy—namely, damage to computer systems and electronic information by 
intruders”).

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

43

“Loss” calculations may not include costs incurred by victims primarily 
to aid the government in prosecuting or investigating an offense. U.S.S.G. § 
2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(D)(ii); United States v. Schuster, 467 F.3d 614 (7th Cir. 2006).
In meeting the $5,000 loss requirement, the government may aggregate 
all of the losses to all of the victims of a particular intruder that occur within a 
one-year period, so long as the losses result from a “related course of conduct.” 
Thus,  evidence  showing  that  a  particular  intruder  broke  into  a  computer 
network five times and caused $1,000 loss each time would meet the statutory 
requirement, as would $1 loss to 5,000 computers caused by the release of a 
single virus or worm.9 In addition, section 1030(e)(12) makes clear that for 
purposes of establishing loss, the victim can be any natural or legal “person,” 
including corporations, government agencies, or other legal entities.10

The statute does not impose a proximate causation requirement on loss or 
any other of the special harms listed in section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i). Nonetheless, 
in Middleton, the Ninth Circuit noted approvingly that the jury in that case was 
instructed that the losses claimed had to be a “natural and foreseeable result” of 
the damage. Middleton, 231 F.3d at 1213. This opinion predates the inclusion 
of a definition of the term “loss” in section 1030. However, given that the 
statutory definition was modeled on the one used in Middleton, prosecutors 
may be well-advised, if possible, to demonstrate that the losses used to reach 
the $5,000 threshold were proximately caused by their defendants’ actions. 

9 Prior to the 2001 amendments, numerous courts struggled with the question of wheth-
er and how loss to several victims could be aggregated to meet the $5,000 loss requirement. 
See, e.g., Chance v. Avenue A., Inc., 165 F. Supp. 2d 1153, 1158 (W.D. Wash. 2001); Thurmond 
v. Compaq Computer Corp., 171 F. Supp. 2d 667, 680 (E.D. Tex. 2001); In re America Online, 
Inc., 168 F. Supp. 2d 1359, 1372-73 (S.D. Fla. 2001); In Re Doubleclick Inc. Privacy Litigation, 
154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 520-25 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). In 2001, Congress clearly settled this issue—at 
least for criminal proceedings—by amending what was then section 1030(a)(5)(B)(I) to al-
low aggregation of loss “resulting from a related course of conduct affecting 1 or more other 
protected computers.” After amendments made in 2008, the relevant provision is found in 
section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I).

10 Prior statutory language arguably left open the question of whether a corporation or 
other legal entity could suffer “loss” for purposes of meeting the $5,000 loss threshold. See 
United States v. Middleton, 231 F.3d 1207, 1213 (9th Cir. 2000) (rejecting defendant’s argu-
ment that “individuals” did not include corporations). In 2001, Congress changed the word 
“individuals” to “persons” and added a broad definition of “person” that includes corpora-
tions, government agencies, and any “legal or other entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(12).

44  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

 

  Medical Care
The second harm in section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i) relates to the “modification 
or  impairment,  or  potential  modification  or  impairment,  of  the  medical 
examination, diagnosis, treatment or care of 1 or more individuals.” 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(II).  This  subsection  provides  strong  protection  to  the 
computer networks of hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities because of 
the importance of those systems and the sensitivity of the data that they contain. 
This type of harm does not require any showing of financial loss. Indeed, the 
impairment to computer data caused by an intruder could be minor and easily 
fixable while still giving rise to justified criminal liability. The evidence only has 
to show that at least one patient’s medical care was at least potentially affected 
as a consequence of the intrusion. 

Example: A system administrator of a hospital resigns her employment. Before 
she leaves, she inserts a malicious program into the operating system’s code that, 
when activated one morning, deletes the passwords of all doctors and nurses in the 
labor and delivery unit. This damage prevents medical personnel from logging 
on to the computer system, making it impossible to access patients’ electronic 
medical records, charts, and other data. Another system administrator corrects 
the problem very quickly, restoring the passwords in ten minutes. No patients 
were in the labor and delivery unit during the incident.
The  conduct  in  this  example  should  satisfy  the  “medical”  special  harm 
provision. Even though nothing harmful actually occurred as a consequence 
of the impairment to the system in this case, it requires little imagination to 
conjure a different outcome where the inability to access the computer system 
would affect a doctor or nurse’s ability to treat a patient. Provided that a medical 
professional can testify that a patient’s treatment or care could potentially have 
been modified or impaired, the government can prove this harm. 

 

Physical Injury

 
The third specified harm occurs when the damage to a computer causes 
“physical injury to any person.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(III). Computer 
networks control many vital systems in our society, such as air traffic control 
and 911 emergency telephone service. Disruption of these computers could 
directly result in physical injury. 

One  issue  to  consider  is  whether  the  chain  of  causation  between  the 
damaged computer and the injury is too attenuated for the court to hold the 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

45

intruder criminally responsible. Although the statute does not explicitly require 
that the injury be proximately caused, courts have much experience in applying 
this sort of test in other areas of the law and might import the doctrine here. 
So long as there is a reasonable connection between the damaged computer 
and the injury, however, charging section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(III) is appropriate. 
For example, suppose that an intruder succeeds in accessing an electric utility’s 
computer system and shuts down power to a three-square-block area, causing 
the traffic lights to shut down, and a car accident results. If one of the drivers 
suffers back and neck injuries, the intruder could properly be convicted under 
this subsection.

 

  Threats to Public Health or Safety
The fourth specified harm is closely related to physical injury, but only 
requires a “threat” to public health or safety. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(A)
(i)(IV). Indeed, because the government need not prove actual physical harm 
to a person, this subsection applies to a wider range of circumstances. Today, 
computer networks control many of the nation’s critical infrastructures, such 
as  electricity  and  gas  distribution,  water  purification,  nuclear  power,  and 
transportation. Damage to the computers that operate these systems or their 
control and safety mechanisms can create a threat to the safety of many people 
at once.

 

Justice, National Defense, or National Security

 
The specified harm requirement can also be satisfied if the damage affects 
“a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the 
administration  of  justice,  national  defense,  or  national  security.”  18  U.S.C. 
§  1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(V).  In  2001,  Congress  added  this  subsection  because 
this  sort  of  damage  can  affect  critically  important  functions—such  as  one 
intruder’s attempt to access a court computer without authority and change his 
sentence—but may not be easily quantified in terms of economic loss under 
section 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I).

Here, “the administration of justice” includes court system computers, but 
would also appropriately extend to computers owned by state or federal law 
enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and probation offices. Similarly, computers 
used  “in  furtherance  of  .  .  .  national  defense,  or  national  security”  would 
include most computer networks owned by the Department of Defense. The 
statutory language does not require that the computer be owned or operated 
by the government—computers owned by a defense contractor, for example, 

46  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

could be “used . . . for” the military in furtherance of national security. At the 
same time, not every Defense Department computer is used “in furtherance” 
of the national defense. A computer at the cafeteria in the Pentagon might not 
qualify, for example.

 

  Damage to ten or more computers
The  last  specified  harm  occurs  if  a  defendant  causes  damage  “affecting 
10  or  more  protected  computers  during  any  1-year  period.”  18  U.S.C.  § 
1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(VI). This type of harm would exist, for example, if a criminal 
installed malicious spyware on a number of computers. Prosecutors can utilize 
this  provision  when  bringing  charges  for  violations  that  involve  botnets  or 
other circumstances in which the criminal has affected many machines but the 
nature of the damage makes it difficult or impossible to quantify the harm to 
each computer or to prove that the total value of the losses exceeds $5,000.

 

5.  Penalties
If  an  offender  accesses  a  computer  without  authorization  and  causes 
damage  and  loss  with  no  culpable  mental  state  (i.e.,  accidentally  or 
negligently), he commits a violation of section 1030(a)(5)(C). This crime is a 
misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(c)(4)(G). However, violations of section 1030(a)(5)(C) that follow a 
previous conviction under section 1030 result in a ten-year maximum penalty. 
18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(D).

47

sentenced up to one year of imprisonment. The crime becomes a felony, however, 
if the government can show that the offender caused one of six specific types 
of harm discussed above. An offender who causes such harm while violating 
section 1030(a)(5)(A) is subject to a ten-year maximum prison term, a fine, 
or both, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(B), while an offender who causes such harm 
while violating section 1030(a)(5)(B) is subject to a five-year maximum prison 
term, a fine, or both, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(A). Importantly, the statute does 
not create a mental state with respect to these resulting harms. The government 
need not prove that the actor intended to cause any particular one of these 
harms, but merely that the actor’s conduct in fact caused the harm. See United 
States  v.  Suplita,  Case  No.  01cr3650,  Order  Denying  Motion  to  Dismiss 
Indictment, at 4 (S.D. Cal. July 23, 2002) (available at www.cybercrime.gov/

In  any  event,  if  a  conviction  under  either  section  1030(a)(5)(A)  or  (B) 
follows a conviction for any crime under section 1030, the maximum sentence 
rises to 20 years’ imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(C). 

In 2002, Congress added an additional sentencing provision that raised the 
maximum penalties for certain of these crimes that result in serious bodily injury 
or death. If the offender intentionally damages a protected computer under 
section 1030(a)(5)(A) and “attempts to cause or knowingly or recklessly causes 
serious bodily injury,” the maximum penalty rises to 20 years’ imprisonment. 
18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(E). Where the offender knowingly or recklessly causes 
or attempts to cause death, the court may impose life in prison. 18 U.S.C. § 
1030(c)(4)(F).

 

6.  Relation to Other Statutes
In  many  cases,  intruders  cause  damage  to  systems  even  though  their 
primary  intent  is  to  steal  information  or  commit  a  fraud  in  violation  of 
sections 1030(a)(2) or (a)(4). For example, intruders commonly try to make 
it difficult for system administrators to detect them by erasing log files that 
show that they accessed the computer network. Deleting these files constitutes 
intentional “damage” for purposes of section 1030(a)(5). Similarly, intruders 
commonly  modify  system  programs  or  install  new  programs  to  circumvent 
the computer’s security so that they can access the computer again later. This 
activity impairs the integrity of the computer and its programs and therefore 
meets the damage requirement. A charge under section 1030(a)(5) is therefore 
appropriate in addition to any other charges under section 1030.

48  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

Prosecutors  should  also  consider  section 1030(a)(5)  in  cases  where  an 
individual breaks into a federal government computer in violation of section 
1030(a)(3), a misdemeanor. If the act causes damage, as well as one of the 
enumerated harms, prosecutors may be able to charge a felony violation of 
section 1030(a)(5).

When faced with conduct that damages a protected computer, prosecutors 
should also consider several other statutes that punish the same conduct when 
particular circumstances are present. For example, where the criminal act causes 
damage to a computer for communications that is “operated or controlled by 
the United States” or is “used or intended to be used for military or civil defense 
functions,” prosecutors should consider charging 18 U.S.C. § 1362, a ten-year 
felony. Other potentially applicable statutes are discussed in Chapter 3, “Other 
Network Crime Statutes.”

G.  Trafficking in Passwords: 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(6)

Section 1030(a)(6) prohibits a person from knowingly and with intent to 
defraud trafficking in computer passwords and similar information when the 
trafficking affects interstate or foreign commerce, or when the password may be 
used to access without authorization a 
computer  used  by  or  for  the  federal 
government.  First  offenses  of 
this 
section are misdemeanors.

States . . .

shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

49

 

1.  Trafficking
The  term  “traffic”  in  section  1030(a)(6)  is  defined  by  reference  to  the 
definition of the same term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029, which means “transfer, or 
otherwise dispose of, to another, or obtain control of with intent to transfer 
or  dispose  of.”  18  U.S.C.  § 1029(e)(5).  A  profit  motive  is  not  required. 
However, the definition excludes mere possession of passwords if the defendant 
has  no  intent  to  transfer  or  dispose  of  them.  Id.  Similarly,  personal  use  of 
an unauthorized password is not a violation of section 1030(a)(6), although 
it  may  be  a  violation  of  other  provisions  under  section  1030  that  apply  to 
unauthorized access to computers or of section 1029.

 

2.  Computer Password or Similar Information
The  term  “password”  does  not  mean  just  a  single  word  or  phrase  that 
enables one to access a computer. As a Senate report noted, the statute prohibits 
trafficking in passwords or similar information:

The Committee recognizes that a “password” may actually be 
comprised  of  a  set  of  instructions  or  directions  for  gaining 
access  to  a  computer  and  intends  that  the  word  “password” 
be construed broadly enough to encompass both single words 
and longer more detailed explanations on how to access others’ 
computers. 

S.  Rep.  No.  99-432,  at  13  (1986),  reprinted  in  1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2479, 
2491. Therefore, prosecutors should apply the term “password” using a broad 
meaning to include any instructions that safeguard a computer. Pass phrases, 
codes, usernames, or any other method or combination of methods by which 
a user is authenticated to a computer system may qualify as a password under 
section 1030(a)(6).

 

3.  Knowingly and With Intent to Defraud
For a discussion of this phrase in section 1030(a)(4), please see page 27. 

 
 

4.  Object
  Trafficking Affects Interstate or Foreign Commerce
For a violation of subsection (A), the trafficking must affect interstate or 
foreign commerce. The phrase “affects interstate or foreign commerce” is not 
statutorily defined or interpreted in case law. However, courts have typically 

50  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

construed this requirement expansively when interpreting other statutes that 
require a certain conduct to affect interstate or foreign commerce. For example, 
the Ninth Circuit held that a defendant’s illicit possession of out-of-state credit 
card account numbers is an offense “affecting interstate or foreign commerce” 
within the meaning of section 1029. United States v. Rushdan, 870 F.2d 1509, 
1514 (9th Cir. 1989). In a similar vein, the Sixth Circuit held that a fraudulent 
credit  card  transaction  affects  interstate  commerce  for  purposes  of  section 
1029, inasmuch as banking channels were used for gaining authorization for 
the charges. United States v. Scartz, 838 F.2d 876, 879 (6th Cir. 1988).
 

  Computer Used By or For the U.S. Government
To prove a violation of subsection (B), the password or similar information 
must be for accessing without authorization a computer “used by or for the 
Government of the United States.” This phrase, which is also used in section 
1030(a)(3)), is not defined by statute or case law, but its plain meaning should 
encompass any computer used for official business by a federal government 
employee or on behalf of the federal government.
 

5.  Penalties
Violations of section 1030(a)(6) are misdemeanors punishable by a fine or a 
one-year prison term for the first offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(A). If the 
defendant has a previous conviction under section 1030, the maximum sentence 
increases to ten years’ imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(C).
 

6.  Relation to Other Statutes
Given the shared statutory definition, section 1030(a)(6) cases often overlap 
with access device cases under section 1029. Passwords are also access devices 
under section 1029. See, e.g., United States v. Fernandez, 1993 WL 88197, at 
*2 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (holding that the plain meaning of the term “access device” 
covers  “stolen  and  fraudulently  obtained  passwords  which  may  be  used  to 
access computers to wrongfully obtain things of value”). For more information 
on section 1029, see Chapter 3, “Other Network Crime Statutes.”
 

7.  Historical Notes
Congress enacted section 1030(a)(6) in 1986 as a “misdemeanor offense 
aimed  at  penalizing  conduct  associated  with  ‘pirate  bulletin  boards,’  where 
passwords are displayed that permit unauthorized access to others’ computers.” 
S.  Rep.  No.  99-432,  at  13  (1986),  reprinted  in  1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2479,

H.  Threatening to Damage a Computer: 

18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7)
Section 1030(a)(7), which prohibits 
extortion  threats  involving  damage  to 
a  computer  or  involving  confidential 
data,  is  the  high-tech  variation  of 
old-fashioned  extortion.  This  section 
applies,  for  example,  to  situations  in 
which intruders threaten to penetrate a 
system and encrypt or delete a database. 
Other  scenarios  might 
involve  the 
threat  of  distributed  denial  of  service 
attacks  that  would  shut  down  the 
victim’s  computers  or  threats  to  steal 
confidential  data.  Section  1030(a)(7) 
enables the prosecution of modern-day 
extortionists who threaten harm unless 
their demands are met.

(7) with intent to extort from any person any money or other thing of value, 
transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing 
any—

(A) threat to cause damage to a protected computer;
(B)  threat  to  obtain  information  from  a  protected  computer 
without authorization or in excess of authorization or to impair the 
confidentiality  of  information  obtained  from  a  protected  computer 
without authorization or by exceeding authorized access; or 
(C) demand or request for money or other thing of value in relation 
to damage to a protected computer, where such damage was caused to 
facilitate the extortion; 

shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

52  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

 

1.  Intent to Extort Money or Other Thing of Value
In  order  to  prove  the  “intent  to  extort”  element,  it  is  not  necessary  to 
prove that the defendant actually succeeded in obtaining the money or thing 
of value, or that the defendant actually intended to carry out the threat made. 
Extortion generally refers to the intent to obtain money or other thing of value 
with a person’s consent induced by the wrongful use of actual or threatened 
fear, violence, or force. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1951.

 

2.  Transmit Communication In Interstate or Foreign Commerce
The extortion threat must be transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce. 
However, the threat need not be sent electronically. Rather, the statute covers 
“any  interstate  or  international  transmission  of  threats  against  computers, 
computer networks, and their data and programs where the threat is received 
by mail, a telephone call, electronic mail, or through a computerized messaging 
service.” S. Rep. No. 104-357, at 12 (1996), available at 1996 WL 492169. 

 
 

3.  Prohibited Communications
  Threat to Cause Damage to a Protected Computer
The term “damage” is defined in section 1030(e)(8) and is discussed in the 
context of section 1030(a)(5) beginning on page 38. Unlawful threats to cause 
damage include threats to interfere in any way with the normal operation of 
the computer or system in question, including denying access to authorized 
users, erasing or corrupting data or programs, or slowing down the operation 
of the computer or system. See S. Rep. No. 104-357, at 12 (1996), available at 
1996 WL 492169. In contrast, unlawful threats to the business that owns the 
computer system, such as threats to reveal flaws in the network or to reveal that 
the network has been hacked, are not threats to damage a protected computer 
under section 1030(a)(7). However, a threat to a business, rather than to a 
protected computer, might be chargeable as a violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 
U.S.C. § 1951.

The  term  “protected  computer”  is  defined  in  section  1030(e)(2)  and  is 

discussed in the “Key Definitions” on page 4.

 

  Threat to Obtain or Disclose Confidential Information
Section  1030(a)(7)(B)  covers  two  different  scenarios.  In  the  first,  the 
criminal threatens to steal confidential information from the victim’s computer 
systems unless his demands are met. In the second, the criminal has already 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

53

obtained information by exceeding his authorization or accessing the victim’s 
computers  without  authorization  and  threatens  to  disclose  this  previously 
obtained information unless the victim complies with his demands.

 

  Demand or Request in Relation to Damage to a Protected Computer
In some instances, a criminal will refrain from contacting the victim until 
after he has done damage to the victim’s computers but then refuse to repair 
the damage already done unless the victim complies with his demands. For 
example, the criminal may access the victim’s computer system, encrypt data, 
and then demand money for the decryption key. See S. Rep. No. 104-357, 
at 12 (1996), available at 1996 WL 492169. Prosecutors could charge such 
conduct under section 1030(a)(7)(C).

 

4.  Penalties
A violation of section 1030(a)(7) is punishable by a fine and up to five 
years in prison. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(3)(A). If the defendant has a previous 
conviction under section 1030, the maximum sentence increases to 10 years 
imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(3)(B).

 

5.  Relation to Other Statutes
The  elements  of  section  1030(a)(7)  generally  parallel  the  elements  of 
a  Hobbs  Act  violation  (18  U.S.C.  § 1951,  interference  with  commerce  by 
extortion) with some important differences. First, the intent to extort from any 
person money or other thing of value is the same under section 1030(a)(7) and 
under section 1951. However, in contrast to section 1951, section 1030(a)(7) 
does not require proof that the defendant delayed or obstructed commerce. 
Proving that the threat was transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce is 
sufficient.

At least one case has recognized the similarities between the two statutes. In 
United States v. Ivanov, 175 F. Supp. 2d 367 (D. Conn. 2001), the defendant 
hacked into the victim’s network and obtained root access to the victim’s servers. 
He then proposed that the victim hire him as a “security expert” to prevent 
further security breaches, including the deletion of all of the files on the server. 
Without much discussion, the court determined that the analysis under section 
1030(a)(7) was the same as that for the Hobbs Act. See id. at 372.

6.  Historical Notes
Congress added section 1030(a)(7) to the CFAA in 1996 to fill perceived 

gaps in the application of existing anti-extortion statutes:

These  cases,  although  similar  in  some  ways  to  other  cases 
involving  extortionate  threats  directed  against  persons  or 
property, can be different from traditional extortion cases in 
certain respects. It is not entirely clear that existing extortion 
statutes,  which  protect  against  physical  injury  to  persons  or 
property, will cover intangible computerized information.
For  example,  the  “property”  protected  under  existing  laws, 
such  as  the  Hobbs  Act,  18  U.S.C.  1951  (interference  with 
commerce  by  extortion)  or  18  U.S.C.  875(d)  (interstate 
communication of a threat to injure the property of another), 
does not clearly include the operation of a computer, the data 
or programs stored in a computer or its peripheral equipment, 
or the decoding keys to encrypted data.

S. Rep. No. 104-357, at 12 (1996), available at 1996 WL 492169.

I. 

Attempt and Conspiracy: 18 U.S.C. § 1030(b)

Attempts to commit the crimes covered in section 1030 are also criminal 
acts. Although the maximum sentence is the same as for the completed crime, 
the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to apply the appropriate guideline 
for the substantive offense and then decrease the offense level by three. See 
U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(a), (b)(1). For more on sentencing issues, please see Chapter 
5.

Previous  versions  of  section  1030  did  not  specifically  provide  for  the 
prosecution  of  conspiracies.  In  2008,  the  Identity  Theft  Enforcement  and 
Restitution Act amended section 1030(b) to create a new conspiracy offense.  
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1030(b) provides:

Whoever  conspires  to  commit  or  attempts  to  commit  an  offense 
under subsection (a) of this section shall be punished as provided 
in subsection (c) of this section.

Like the drug and money laundering conspiracy statutes (21 U.S.C. § 846 
and 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h)), section 1030(b) makes no reference to an overt 

1. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

55

act. Thus, the government need not prove an overt act in order to obtain a 
conviction for a section 1030 conspiracy. See United States v. Whitfield, 543 
U.S. 209, 214 (2005); United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 14 (1994).

Nor must the object of the conspiracy be achievable; conspiracy to hack a 
honeypot may still violate the CFAA. United States v. Schaffer, 586 F.3d 414 
(6th Cir. 2009) (basis of a conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the 
unlawful act, and not the unlawful act itself; further stating that the illegality 
of the agreement does not depend upon the achievement of its ends, because 
objective  impossibility  is  irrelevant  for  the  conspirators  to  commit  the 
substantive offense).

Despite  the  existence  of  section  1030(b),  however,  prosecutors  should 
consider foregoing charges under this subsection and instead charge defendants 
under the general conspiracy provision found at 18 U.S.C. § 371. Congress failed 
to amend the penalty provisions of section 1030(c) to specify what penalties 
apply to offenders who engage in a conspiracy to violate section 1030. See, e.g., 
18  U.S.C.  §  1030(c)(1)(A)  (specifying  a  penalty  of  10  years  imprisonment 
for  “an  attempt  to  commit  an  offense  punishable  under  this  subparagraph” 
but not mentioning the penalty for conspiracy to commit such an offense). 
Due to the problems and defense challenges to which this ambiguity may give 
rise, prosecutors are asked to contact CCIPS if they are considering charging a 
defendant with conspiracy under section 1030(b).

J. 

Forfeiture: 18 U.S.C. § 1030(i) & (j)

Prior  to  2008,  section  1030  did  not  provide  for  forfeiture  of  property 
used in or derived from computer crime. Congress rectified this gap in the 
2008 Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act through the addition of 
sections 1030(i) & (j).

Title 18, United States Code, Section 1030(i) provides:
(1) The court, in imposing sentence on any person convicted of a violation 
of this section, or convicted of conspiracy to violate this section, shall order, 
in addition to any other sentence imposed and irrespective of any provision 
of State law, that such person forfeit to the United States:

(A)  such  person’s  interest  in  any  personal  property  that  was  used  or 
intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission of such 
violation; and

56  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(B) any property, real or personal, constituting or derived from, any 
proceeds that such person obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of 
such violation.

(2) The criminal forfeiture of property under this subsection, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any judicial proceeding in relation thereto, 
shall be governed by the provisions of section 413 of the Comprehensive 
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except 
subsection (d) of that section.
Under section 1030(i), personal property is criminally forfeitable if it is 
either “used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the commission” of 
a section 1030 violation or if it “constitute[s] or [is] derived from” the proceeds 
of such crime. Real property, however, is forfeitable only if it “constitutes or is 
derived from” the proceeds of a section 1030 offense. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(j)(2). 
This provision applies only to criminal forfeiture; the statute does not provide 
for civil forfeiture proceedings.

Case  law  in  the  forfeiture  context  generally  has  interpreted  the  word 
“proceeds” to mean “gross proceeds.” See, e.g., United States v. Bucci, 582 F.3d 
108  (1st  Cir.  2009);  United  States  v. Valladares,  544  F.3d  1257  (11th  Cir. 
2008).  The  Seventh  Circuit,  however,  has  reached  the  opposite  conclusion. 
See, e.g., United States v. Segal, 495 F.3d 826, 839 (7th Cir. 2006) (“[O]ur cases 
require that proceeds forfeitures be of net, not gross, proceeds and that while 
restitution  is  loss  based,  forfeiture  is  gain  based.”);  United  States  v.  Masters, 
924 F.2d 1362, 1369-1370 (7th Cir. 1991) (proceeds forfeitable under RICO 
statute are limited to net proceeds, because they alone represent the defendant’s 
gain).

Additionally, the proceeds of a section 1030 violation are subject to criminal 
and  civil  forfeiture  under  sections  981  and  982  of Title  18.  18  U.S.C.  §§ 
981(a)(1)(C), 982(a)(2)(B). Violations of section 1030(a)(1) and most felony 
violations  of  section  1030(a)(5)(A)  may  result  in  the  forfeiture  of  property 
involved in the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B), 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)
(G).

Chapter 2
Wiretap Act

Prosecutors  usually  encounter 

the  Wiretap  Act  during  criminal 
investigations,  because  it  regulates  the  use  of  wiretaps  to  investigate  crime. 
However, the Wiretap Act, also known as “Title III,” is both procedural and 
substantive.  It  prohibits  not  just  law  enforcement,  but  “any  person,”  from 
making  an  illegal  interception  or  disclosing  or  using  illegally  intercepted 
material.  18 U.S.C.  §  2511(1).  The Wiretap  Act  was  used,  for  example,  to 
prosecute the Watergate burglars. See United States v. Liddy, 509 F.2d 428 (D.C. 
Cir. 1974). It became a useful computer crime statute in 1986, when Congress 
amended it to explicitly cover “electronic communications”—a broad term that 
includes computer network communications. See Brown v. Waddell, 50 F.3d 
285, 289 (4th Cir. 1995) (“The principal purpose of the 1986 amendments 
to Title III was to extend to ‘electronic communications’ the same protections 
against unauthorized interceptions that Title III had been providing for ‘oral’ 
and ‘wire’ communications via common carrier transmissions.”). 

Prosecutors should consider whether the Wiretap Act applies whenever a 
case involves spyware users and manufacturers, intruders using packet sniffers, 
persons improperly cloning email accounts, or any other surreptitious collection 
of communications from a victim’s computer. 

The Wiretap Act is a complex subject and this chapter is not comprehensive.1 
This chapter focuses on three of its prohibitions, each addressed below: the 
interception of communications, 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a) & (b); the disclosure 
of intercepted communications, 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(c) & (e); and the use 

 
1  This  manual  focuses  only  on  the  prosecution  of  criminal  offenses.  For  more  on  law 
enforcement’s  access  to  information  concerning  communications,  see  U.S.  Department  of 
Justice, Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Inves-
tigations (Office of Legal Education 2009). In addition, in keeping with this manual’s focus 
on computer crime, this chapter highlights Title III’s applicability in that context and does 
not address every type of case covered by the Act. Section 2511(1)(b) applies only to certain 
interceptions of oral communications, i.e., communications that are “uttered by a person” and 
are not electronic communications. See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(2) (definition of “oral communica-
tion”). Accordingly, section 2511(1)(b) generally will not apply to network intrusions, which 
almost always involve electronic communications, and that section is not discussed here.

A. 

Intercepting a Communication: 
18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a)

The core prohibition of the Wiretap Act is found at section 2511(1)(a), 
which prohibits “any person” from intentionally intercepting, or attempting 
to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication. 

Title 18, United States Code, Section 2511(1)(a) provides:
Except as otherwise specifically provided 
in this chapter any person who—

2511(1)(a) Summary

intentionally 

(a) 
intercepts, 
endeavors  to  intercept,  or  procures 
any  other  person  to  intercept  or 
endeavor  to  intercept,  any  wire, 
oral,  or  electronic  communication 
. . .

1.  Intentional
2.  interception (or endeavoring or 
procuring another to intercept)

3.  of the contents
4.  of a wire, oral or electronic 

communication

5.  by use of a device.

shall be punished as provided in subsection (4).
The  First  Circuit  recently  provided  a  comprehensive  statement  of  the 
elements of a section 2511(1)(a) offense in a civil case. In re Pharmatrak, Inc. 
Privacy Litigation, 329 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 2003). Those elements are listed 
in the box above and are discussed below. Section 2511(1)(a)’s text describes 
only three elements: (1) intentionally, (2) intercepts, and (3) communication. 
However,  embedded  in  the  definitions  are  additional  requirements  that 
indictments  and  jury  instructions  also  frequently  include:  specifically,  the 
requirements that an interception be done with a “device,” and that it be done 
contemporaneously with transmission.

 

1.  Intentional
In a civil Wiretap Act case, the Fourth Circuit approved of the following 

familiar jury instruction defining “intentional.”

60  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

An  act  is  done  intentionally  if  it  is  done  knowingly  or 
purposefully. That is, an act is intentional if it is the conscious 
objective of the person to do the act or cause the result. An 
act  is  not  intentional  if  it  is  the  product  of  inadvertence  or 
mistake. However, the defendant’s motive is not relevant and 
the defendant needs not to have intended the precise results of 
its conduct or have known its conduct violated the law.

Abraham v. County of Greenville, 237 F.3d 386, 391 (4th Cir. 2001); see also 
United  States  v. Townsend,  987  F.2d  927,  930  (2d  Cir.  1993)  (setting  forth 
similar model jury charge for mental state in a Wiretap Act prosecution).

Defendants  sometimes  argue  that  they  lacked  the  required  mental  state 
because they believed that their interception was lawful. However, one can be 
guilty of intentionally intercepting a communication even if one incorrectly 
believed  the  interception  was  lawful.  In  1986,  as  part  of  the  Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act, Congress changed the mental state in section 
2511 from “willfully” to “intentionally.” See S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 23 (1986), 
reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3577; United States v. Townsend, 987 
F.2d 927, 930 (2d Cir. 1993). Before the change, some courts had held that 
the old “willfully” standard meant that the jury could consider “evidence that 
the accused acted or failed to act because of ignorance of the law” as ignorance 
of the law was relevant to “whether or not the accused acted or failed to act 
with specific intent.” United States v. Schilleci, 545 F.2d 519, 523-24 (5th Cir. 
1977). The Senate Report made clear that “[t]he intentional state of mind is 
applicable only to conduct and results.” S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 23.

Thus, a mistake of law is not a defense to a Wiretap Act charge; a defendant 
must have intended to intercept a covered communication, but he or she need 
not have specifically intended to violate a legal duty not to intercept. See Peavy 
v. WFAA-TV, Inc., 221 F.3d 158, 178-79 (5th Cir. 2000); Reynolds v. Spears, 
93 F.3d 428, 435-36 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding that reliance on incorrect advice 
from law enforcement officer is not a defense); Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 
285 (1st Cir. 1993) (rejecting a good faith defense where defendant mistakenly 
believed  his  use  and  disclosure  was  authorized  by  the  statute);  Thompson  v. 
Dulaney, 970 F.2d 744, 749 (10th Cir. 1992) (noting that a “defendant may 
be presumed to know the law”); Heggy v. Heggy, 944 F.2d 1537, 1541-42 (10th 
Cir.  1991)  (rejecting  a  “good  faith”  defense  based  upon  a  mistake  of  law); 
Narducci v. Village of Bellwood, 444 F. Supp. 2d 924, 935 (N.D. Ill. 2006) 

2. Wiretap Act

(intent requirement “does not, however, require any intent to violate the law, 
or even any knowledge that the interception would be illegal”).

Similarly, “[t]he term ‘intentional’ is not meant to connote the existence 
of a motive.” S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 24. Defendants might be able to argue 
that  their  purposes  in  illegally  intercepting  communications  were  noble 
because  their  interceptions  were  part  of  personal  investigations  into  crime 
or  malfeasance.  Such  purposes  are  irrelevant  to  mental  state.  See  Gelbard  v. 
United  States,  408  U.S.  41,  50  (1972)  (“Virtually  all  concede  that  the  use 
of wiretapping or electronic surveillance techniques by private unauthorized 
hands has little justification where communications are intercepted without 
the consent of one of the participants.”); Townsend, 987 F.2d at 931 (“whether 
the defendant had a good or evil purpose in utilizing the automatic recording 
equipment is, therefore, irrelevant”); S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 24 (“[P]eople who 
steal because they like to or to get more money or to feed the poor, like Robin 
Hood, all commit the same crime. . . . The word ‘intentional’ describes the 
mental attitude associated with an act that is being done on purpose. It does 
not suggest that the act was committed for a particular evil purpose.”).

 

2.  Interception
The Wiretap Act defines an “intercept” as “the aural or other acquisition of 
the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of 
any electronic, mechanical, or other device.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(4). Although 
only twenty-five words long, this definition is surprisingly complex. It uses no 
fewer than five terms that are each themselves separately defined in section 
2510—“contents,” “wire communication,” “electronic communication,” “oral 
communication,” and “electronic, mechanical, or other device.” See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2510(8), (1), (12), (2) & (5). These concepts are each sufficiently complex 
that they are discussed in their own sections below. Additionally, a majority of 
courts have read into the definition of “intercept” a requirement that does not 
appear in the text of the statute—that the “acquisition” of the communication 
be “contemporaneous” with the transmission of the communication. 

The “aural or other acquisition” of the contents of a communication refers 
to some “activity engaged in at the time of the . . . communication which 
causes such communication to be overheard by uninvited listeners.” United 
States  v.  Turk,  526  F.2d  654,  658  (5th  Cir.  1976).  Typically,  this  activity 
involves a “tampering with the established means of communication.” United 
States  v.  Campagnuolo,  592  F.2d  852,  862  (5th  Cir.  1979),  quoting  United 

62  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

States v. Pasha, 332 F.2d 193, 198 (7th Cir. 1964). A defendant intercepts a 
communication upon acquisition; it is not necessary for the defendant to also 
listen  to  or  read  the  communication.  See  Sanders  v.  Robert  Bosch  Corp.,  38 
F.3d 736, 740 (4th Cir. 1994) (“recording of a telephone conversation alone 
constitutes an ‘aural . . . acquisition’ of that conversation”); Walden v. City of 
Providence, 495 F. Supp. 2d 245, 262 (D.R.I. 2007) (citing cases).

The Turk court considered the argument that police officers who found a 
cassette tape recording made by a criminal defendant of his own conversations 
were “intercepting” the recorded conversation each time they chose to play the 
cassette tape. The court rejected the argument, holding that “an ‘interception’ 
requires, at the least, involvement in the initial use of the device contemporaneous 
with the communication to transmit or preserve the communication.” Turk, 
526 F.2d at 658 n.3.

Just as the cassette tape in Turk held a recording of a telephone conversation, 
computers  can  hold  recordings  of  electronic  communications.  Unlike  the 
telephone  conversations  that  the  Wiretap  Act  initially  protected,  electronic 
communications  usually  take  the  form  of  text.  The  computer  systems  that 
process  email,  text  messages,  instant  messages,  and  other  forms  of  written 
electronic communication record and save a full copy of the contents of the 
communication.  This  is  usually  inherent  in  the  design  of  the  system:  “all 
messages are recorded and stored not because anyone is ‘tapping’ the system, 
but simply because that’s how the system works.” Bohach v. City of Reno, 932 
F. Supp. 1232, 1234 (D. Nev. 1996). Merely obtaining a copy of a recorded 
communication—a  year-old  email  on  a  mail  server,  for  example—is  not 
necessarily an “intercept[ion]” of the communication under the Wiretap Act.
Applying  Turk,  most  courts  have  held  that  both  wire  and  electronic 
communications are “intercepted” within the meaning of Title III only when 
such communications are acquired contemporaneously with their transmission. 
An individual who obtains access to a stored copy of the communication left 
behind after the communication reached its destination does not “intercept” 
the  communication.  See,  e.g.,  Steve  Jackson  Games,  Inc.  v.  United  States 
Secret  Service,  36  F.3d  457,  460-63  (5th  Cir.  1994)  (access  to  stored  email 
communications); Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 352 F.3d 107, 113-14 
(3d Cir. 2003) (same); Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 302 F.3d 868, 876-
79 (9th Cir. 2002) (website); United States v. Steiger, 318 F.3d 1039, 1047-50 
(11th Cir. 2003) (files stored on hard drive); United States v. Mercado-Nava, 
486 F. Supp. 2d 1271, 1279 (D. Kan. 2007) (numbers stored in cell phone); 

2. Wiretap Act

United States v. Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d 71, 75 (D.D.C. 2006) (text messages); 
United  States  v.  Reyes,  922  F.  Supp.  818,  836-37  (S.D.N.Y.  1996)  (pager 
communications); Bohach, 932 F. Supp. at 1235-36 (same). 

However,  the  First  Circuit  has  suggested  that  the  contemporaneity 
requirement, which was developed during the era of telephone wiretaps, “may 
not be apt to address issues involving the application of the Wiretap Act to 
electronic communications.” United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 79-80 
(1st Cir. 2005) (en banc) (citing In re Pharmatrak, Inc. Privacy Litigation, 329 
F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir. 2003)); see also Potter v. Havlicek, 2007 WL 539534, at 
*6-7 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 14, 2007) (finding “substantial likelihood” that the Sixth 
Circuit will find the contemporaneity requirement does not apply to electronic 
communications).

In United States v. Szymuszkiewicz, --- F.3d ----, 2010 WL 3503506 (7th 
Cir. 2010), the Seventh Circuit stated that “[t]here is no timing requirement 
in the Wiretap Act, and judges ought not add to statutory definitions.” Id. 
at *4. It stated that acquisition of a stored voice message would fall within 
the definition of “interception,” and that “[u]nder the statute, any acquisition 
of  information  using  a  device  is  an  interception.”  Id.  Szymuszkiewicz  was  a 
prosecution for a violation of the Wiretap Act through the interception of e-mail. 
The court found that the evidence in that case established that the defendant 
intercepted e-mail contemporaneous with transmission. Consequently, despite 
Szymuszkiewicz, prosecutors are advised to charge Wiretap Act violations only 
when the contemporaneity requirement is present.

Courts have generally not delved into the meaning of “contemporaneous.” 
Exactly how close in time an acquisition must be to a transmission remains an 
open question. It is clear that “contemporaneous” cannot mean “simultaneous.” 
It  is  difficult  to  imagine  that  Congress  would  differentiate  its  protection  of 
communications by the nanosecond, protecting them as they travel as electrical 
or optical impulses along a cable but then immediately ceasing protection the 
moment  they  are  recorded  in  any  fashion.  However,  the  Eleventh  Circuit 
suggested in dicta that “contemporaneous” must equate with a communication 
“in flight.” Steiger, 318 F.3d at 1050. By contrast, the First Circuit held the 
contemporaneity  requirement  could  be  read  simply  to  exclude  acquisitions 
“made  a  substantial  amount  of  time  after  material  was  put  into  electronic 
storage.”  In  re  Pharmatrak,  Inc.  Privacy  Litigation,  329  F.3d  9,  21  (1st  Cir. 
2003). 

64  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

This question arises especially often in some email wiretap cases. Email can 
easily be captured at the mail server; someone with the ability to configure the 
mail server can cause it to save copies of mail associated with a certain account. 
For example, in United States v. Councilman, 373 F.3d 197 (1st Cir.), reversed 
on rehearing en banc, 418 F.3d 67 (1st Cir. 2005), the indictment alleged that 
before email messages were ultimately delivered to customers, the defendant’s 
software program made copies of the messages from the servers that were set up 
to deliver the messages. The indictment charged this as a Wiretap Act violation. 
Two of the three judges held that email messages acquired from a computer’s 
random access memory or hard disk were not intercepted “contemporaneously” 
with  transmission.  On  rehearing  en  banc,  the  First  Circuit  reversed  the 
panel decision, holding that email in “electronic storage”—a statutory term 
meaning “temporary, intermediate storage,” see 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17)—can be 
intercepted under the Wiretap Act. See United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 
67 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).

In  practice,  prosecutors  should  assume  that  the  “contemporaneous” 
element applies. When a defendant has interfered with the way that a computer 
system processes incoming or outgoing messages, causing copies to be stored or 
forwarded to him at approximately the same time that the computer handled 
them,  then  it  is  safe  to  argue  that  the  contemporaneity  element  has  been 
satisfied. If a Councilman-type argument appears to apply to a prosecution, 
prosecutors are encouraged to contact CCIPS at (202) 514-1026. However, if 
a defendant appears to have simply accessed a computer system and obtained 
previously  stored  copies  of  a  message,  then  the  defendant  might  not  have 
violated  the Wiretap  Act.  Instead,  prosecutors  should  consider  charging  18 
U.S.C.  §  1030(a)(2),  which  prohibits  accessing  a  protected  computer  and 
obtaining information, or the lesser-used 18 U.S.C. § 2701, which prohibits 
access to certain communications residing on the computers of an electronic 
communication service provider.

   3.  Contents of a Communication

To  be  an  interception,  the  acquisition  must  be  of  the  contents  of  the 
communication. 18 U.S.C. § 2510(4). “‘[C]ontents’, when used with respect 
to  any  wire,  oral,  or  electronic  communication,  includes  any  information 
concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.” 18 
U.S.C. § 2510(8). Congress amended the statute in 1986 “to exclude from 
the definition of the term ‘contents,’ the identity of the parties or the existence 
of  the  communication.”  S.  Rep.  No.  99-541,  at  13  (1986).  Thus,  merely 

2. Wiretap Act 

65

learning the fact that a communication is occurring, or being able to tell who 
is communicating, is not an interception of the communication. Obtaining 
this non-“content” information about a communication might, however, be a 
misdemeanor violation of the prohibition on pen registers and trap and trace 
devices. See 18 U.S.C. § 3121(d).

Some types of information concerning network communications, such as 
full-path URLs, may raise arguments about whether they contain content. We 
encourage prosecutors who have questions about whether a particular type of 
information constitutes “contents” under the Wiretap Act to contact CCIPS 
for assistance at (202) 514-1026.

 

4.  Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communication
The Wiretap Act prohibits the interception of “any wire, oral, or electronic 
communication.” 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a). Those are three different classifications 
of communication, each with a statutory definition. “Wire” communications 
roughly correspond to traditional telephone conversations: those that contain 
the  human  voice,  transmitted  through  wires  or  a  similar  communication 
system.  See  18  U.S.C.  § 2510(1),  (18).  “Oral”  communications  are  vocal 
communications spoken by persons in private. See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(2); Doe 
v. Smith, 429 F.3d 706, 709 (7th Cir. 2005) (prohibition on interception of 
“oral communications” includes sound track of a video recording). “Electronic” 
communications are most every other type of communication sent using the 
electronic spectrum, including computer network communications that do not 
contain the human voice. See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(12); S. Rep. 99-541, at 14 (“As 
a general rule, a communication is an electronic communication protected by 
the federal wiretap law if it is not carried by sound waves and cannot fairly be 
characterized as containing the human voice.”).

The definitions of “wire communication” and “electronic communication” 
both require that the “communication” be sent using a facility or system that 
affects interstate or foreign commerce. See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(1), (12). Although 
this  does  not  require  that  the  communication  actually  travel  interstate,  it 
does  exclude  some  purely  local  communications.  For  example,  “an  internal 
communication device that physically resembles a telephone handset,” used 
to  allow  prisoners  to  communicate  with  visitors,  did  not  qualify  because  it 
was “not connected to any facility capable of transmitting interstate or foreign 
communications.” United States v. Peoples, 250 F.3d 630, 636 (8th Cir. 2001). 
The  Internet  easily  meets  the  definition  of  a  facility  or  system  that  affects 

66  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

interstate  or  foreign  commerce.  See  United  States  v.  Sutcliffe,  505  F.3d  944, 
952-53 (9th Cir. 2007) (“As both the means to engage in commerce and the 
method by which transactions occur, ‘the Internet is an instrumentality and 
channel of interstate commerce.’”).

In at least one circuit, failure to establish the interstate aspect of the facilities 
(and a lack of judicial notice thereof) led to acquittal in a Title III prosecution. 
See United States v. Jones, 580 F.2d 219 (6th Cir. 1978). In response, the Fifth 
Circuit has held that the trivial proof of a telephone number’s area code suffices 
to  establish  the  interstate  nexus.  See  United  States  v.  Lentz,  624  F.2d  1280, 
1285-86 (5th Cir. 1980); see also United States v. Burroughs, 564 F.2d 1111, 
1115 (4th Cir. 1977) (as to § 2511(1)(a), “[t]he essential element is that some 
basis for federal jurisdiction be established at trial”).

Defendants  sometimes  attempt  to  argue  that  the  communication  they 
intercepted did not meet this interstate commerce requirement because the 
particular leg of the communication that they intercepted was intrastate. For 
instance, a defendant has claimed that his device that acquired transfers between 
a keyboard and a computer did not acquire any electronic communications. 
United States v. Ropp, 347 F. Supp. 2d 831 (C.D. Cal. 2004). In Ropp, the 
defendant placed a piece of hardware between the victim’s computer and her 
keyboard that recorded the signals transmitted between the two. Id. The court 
dismissed the indictment charging a violation of section 2511 because it found 
that  the  communications  that  the  defendant  acquired  were  not  “electronic 
communications” within the meaning of the statute. Id. The court concluded 
that “the communications in question involved preparation of emails and other 
communications, but were not themselves emails or any other communication 
at the time of the interception.” Id. at 835 n.1. Because the court found that the 
typing was a communication “with [the victim’s] own computer,” it reasoned 
that “[a]t the time of interception, [the communications] no more affected 
interstate commerce than a letter, placed in a stamped envelope, that has not 
yet been mailed.” Id.

Notwithstanding  the  Ropp  decision,  prosecutors  should  pursue  cases 
involving interceptions occurring on computers or internal networks that affect 
interstate commerce. For example, if an individual installs malicious software 
on the victim’s computer that makes a surreptitious copy every time an email is 
sent, or captures such messages as they move on the local area network on their 
way to their ultimate destination halfway around the world, such cases can be 
prosecuted under section 2511.

2. Wiretap Act 

67

The text of section 2511 and the statute’s legislative history support this 
interpretation. A transfer should include all transmission of the communication 
from  the  originator  to  the  recipient.  The  plain  text  of  the  definition  of 
“electronic communication” is incompatible with a more piecemeal approach. 
The  definition  explicitly  contemplates  that  a  “transfer”  may  be  transmitted 
by a system “in whole or in part.” If “transfer” were meant to refer to each 
relay between components on a communication’s journey from originator to 
recipient, no system could be said to transmit a transfer “in part.”

In addition, the legislative history of the 1986 amendments that added 
the term “electronic communication” provides some useful explanation. The 
House Report explicitly states that “[t]o the extent that electronic and wire 
communications  passing  through  [customer  equipment]  affect  interstate 
commerce, the Committee intends that those communications be protected 
under  section  2511.”  H.R.  Rep.  No.  99-647,  at  33.  Similarly,  the  Senate 
Report  discusses  the  inclusion  of  communications  on  private  networks  and 
intracompany communications systems. See S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 12, reprinted 
in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3566. In these discussions, Congress explicitly 
rejected the premise that acquiring a communication on the customer’s own 
equipment would take it out of the protections of the Wiretap Act.

 

5.  Use of a Device
Under  the  Wiretap  Act,  an  “interception”  must  occur  by  means  of  an 
“[e]lectronic,  mechanical  or  other  device.”  18  U.S.C.  § 2510(4).  Generally, 
“‘electronic, mechanical or other device’ means any device or apparatus which 
can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication,” subject to 
two exceptions discussed below. 18 U.S.C. § 2510(5). Even though the “device” 
language is not contained in section 2511(1)(a) itself, but in the definition of 
“interception,”  some  courts  have  treated  it  as  an  independent  element  of  a 
section 2511(1)(a) violation. See, e.g., United States v. Duncan, 598 F.2d 839, 
847 (4th Cir. 1979); United States v. Harpel, 493 F.2d 346, 351 (10th Cir. 
1974). 

Congress  included  the  “device”  requirement  in  the  statute  in  order  to 
eliminate from its scope the plain, unaided use of natural human senses to 
obtain the contents of a communication. Because the Act protects not only 
wire  and  electronic  communications,  but  also  “oral”  communications—a 
communication “uttered by a person” with a reasonable expectation of privacy, 
18 U.S.C. § 2510(2)—Congress sought to define “intercept” in a way that 

68  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

would not criminalize simply overhearing a private conversation. When wire 
or electronic communications are intercepted, the use of a “device” is implicit; 
there is simply no way to obtain the contents of a radio transmission without 
using a radio, or to obtain the contents of a computer network transmission 
without a computer. In a typical network crime, the “device” is a computer used 
to intercept the communication or a software program running on a computer. 
Each satisfies the statutory requirements. See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(5); cf. Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 940 (2005) (in a 
copyright inducement civil case, referring to software as a “device”).

In its definition of “device,” the statute excludes three categories from its 
scope. See Adams v. City of Battle Creek, 250 F.3d 980, 983 (6th Cir. 2001) 
(interpreting  “other  than”  in  definition  to  mean  “excluding”).  The  statute 
eliminates “a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal 
hearing to not better than normal.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(5)(b). This exception 
furthers Congress’ goal of not criminalizing the use of the human ear. 

Additionally, the statute creates two “in-the-ordinary-course-of-business” 

exceptions to wiretap liability in section 2510(5)(a).

 

“Extension Telephone” Exception

 
The first reads of these exception reads:

any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, 
or  any  component  thereof  .  .  .  furnished  to  the  subscriber 
or  user  by  a  provider  of  wire  or  electronic  communication 
service in the ordinary course of its business and being used 
by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business 
or furnished by such subscriber or user for connection to the 
facilities of such service and used in the ordinary course of its 
business.

18 U.S.C. § 2510(5)(a)(i).

Subparagraph  (i)  essentially  exempts  from  the  statute’s  scope  the  use  of 
basic, everyday equipment that most people would expect to be used, such as a 
subscriber’s own telephone. These non-“devices” must be used “by the subscriber 
or user,” not by an interloper. (The word “user” is defined in § 2510(13) to 
mean someone who has been “duly authorized” by a provider to use its service). 
Also, they must be “furnished” either by the provider “in the ordinary course 
of its business” or by the “subscriber or user.” Were it not for this exemption, 

2. Wiretap Act 

69

a person who uses a telephone to talk with someone else would be engaging in 
an “interception” of his own conversation because he “acquires” its “contents” 
using a “device;” this exemption removes a subscriber’s own telephone from the 
definition of “device.” (Even without this exemption, such an “interception” 
likely would be lawful under the consent exception, discussed below).

The  exception  in  section 2510(5)(a)(i)  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the 
“extension  telephone”  exception,  because  several  land-line  telephone  cases 
involved persons using extension telephones (that is, an additional telephone 
set  connected  to  the  same  telephone  land-line)  to  listen  to  other  people’s 
conversations.  The  “extension  telephone”  exception  makes  clear  that  when 
a phone company furnishes an employer with an extension telephone for a 
legitimate work-related purpose, the employer’s monitoring of employees using 
the extension phone for legitimate work-related purposes does not violate Title 
III. See Briggs v. American Air Filter Co., 630 F.2d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 1980) 
(reviewing legislative history of Title III); Watkins v. L.M. Berry & Co., 704 F.2d 
577, 582 (11th Cir. 1983) (applying exception to permit monitoring of sales 
representatives); James v. Newspaper Agency Corp., 591 F.2d 579, 581 (10th 
Cir. 1979) (applying exception to permit monitoring of newspaper employees’ 
conversations with customers). 

The  case  law  interpreting  the  extension  telephone  exception  is  split, 
however, owing to the ambiguity of the phrase “ordinary course of business.” 
Some courts have interpreted “ordinary course of business” broadly to mean 
“within  the  scope  of  a  person’s  legitimate  concern,”  and  have  applied  the 
extension telephone exception to contexts such as interspousal disputes. See, 
e.g.,  Simpson  v.  Simpson,  490  F.2d  803,  809  (5th  Cir.  1974)  (holding  that 
husband did not violate Title III by recording wife’s phone calls), cert. denied, 
419 U.S. 897 (1974); Anonymous v. Anonymous, 558 F.2d 677, 678-79 (2d Cir. 
1977) (husband did not violate Title III in recording wife’s conversations with 
their daughter in his custody). Other courts have rejected this broad reading, 
and have implicitly or explicitly excluded surreptitious activity from conduct 
within the “ordinary course of business.” See Glazner v. Glazner, 347 F.3d 1212 
(11th Cir. 2003) (overruling Simpson in the Eleventh Circuit); Adams, 250 
F.3d at 984 (“monitoring in the ordinary course of business requires notice to 
the person or persons being monitored”); Kempf v. Kempf, 868 F.2d 970, 973 
(8th Cir. 1989) (Title III prohibits all wiretapping activities unless specifically 
excepted  and  the  Act  does  not  have  an  express  exception  for  interspousal 
wiretapping); United States v. Harpel, 493 F.2d 346, 351 (10th Cir. 1974) (“We 

70  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

hold as a matter of law that a telephone extension used without authorization 
or  consent  to  surreptitiously  record  a  private  telephone  conversation  is  not 
used in the ordinary course of business.”); Pritchard v. Pritchard, 732 F.2d 372, 
374  (4th  Cir.  1984)  (rejecting  view  that  § 2510(5)(a)  exempts  interspousal 
wiretapping from Title III liability). Some of the courts that have embraced the 
narrower construction of the extension telephone exception have stressed that 
it permits only limited work-related monitoring by employers. See, e.g., Deal v. 
Spears, 980 F.2d 1153, 1158 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding that employer monitoring 
of employee was not authorized by the extension telephone exception in part 
because the scope of the interception was broader than that normally required 
in the ordinary course of business).

Department of Justice policy generally prefers local prosecution of illegal 
interceptions arising from domestic relations disputes, as these case typically 
present less of a federal interest. See USAM 9-60.202.

On top of the ambiguities concerning the contours of this carve-out that 
arise  from  the  definition  of  device,  it  is  not  at  all  clear  that  this  exception 
would transfer to the network crime context. This exception applies only to 
“any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment, or facility . . .” 18 U.S.C. 
§  2510(5)(a)(i). While  computers  may  qualify  as  equipment  or  facilities,  it 
is not yet settled whether “telephone or telegraph” modifies all three types of 
objects. 

“Ordinary Course of Business” Exception

 
The  second  “in-the-ordinary-course-of-business”  exception  in  section 

2510(5)(a) reads: 

any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, 
or any component thereof . . . being used by a provider of wire 
or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of 
its business, or by an investigative or law enforcement officer in 
the ordinary course of his duties. 

18 U.S.C. § 2510(5)(a)(ii).

The second clause of this exception has been held to apply to the recording 
of phone calls made by inmates of prisons and jails, when done pursuant to 
an  announced  policy.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Lewis,  406  F.3d  11,  18  (1st 
Cir.  2005);  United  States  v.  Hammond,  286  F.3d  189,  192  (4th  Cir.  2002) 
(concluding that routine recording of calls made from prison falls within law 

2. Wiretap Act 

71

enforcement exception); United States v. Van Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 292 (9th Cir. 
1996)  (same).  However,  courts  have  applied  it  in  few  other  circumstances. 
Despite  the  apparently  broad  scope  of  the  phrase  “ordinary  course  of  his 
duties,” courts have held that “[t]hat an individual is an investigative or law 
enforcement  officer  does  not  mean  that  all  investigative  activity  is  in  the 
ordinary course of his duties. Indeed, the premise of Title III is that there is 
nothing ‘ordinary’ about the use of a device to capture communications for 
investigative purposes.” Id. As Chief Judge Posner explained:

Investigation is within the ordinary course of law enforcement, 
so  if  “ordinary”  were  read  literally  warrants  would  rarely  if 
ever  be  required  for  electronic  eavesdropping,  which  was 
surely not Congress’s intent. Since the purpose of the statute 
was  primarily  to  regulate  the  use  of  wiretapping  and  other 
electronic  surveillance  for  investigatory  purposes,  “ordinary” 
should not be read so broadly; it is more reasonably interpreted 
to  refer  to  routine  noninvestigative  recording  of  telephone 
conversations. . . . Such recording will rarely be very invasive of 
privacy, and for a reason that does after all bring the ordinary-
course exclusion rather close to the consent exclusion: what is 
ordinary is apt to be known; it imports implicit notice. 
Amati v. City of Woodstock, 176 F.3d 952, 955 (7th Cir. 1999). 

Not all prison recordings qualify under this exception. First, only those 
done  by  “an  investigative  or  law  enforcement  officer”  qualify.  That  term, 
defined in section 2510(7), is limited to persons “empowered by law to conduct 
investigations of or to make arrests for” the special felony statutes enumerated 
in section 2516. This category includes federal corrections officers. See Lewis, 
406 F.3d at 16. Second, for a prison recording to be “in the ordinary course of 
his duties,” the phone call must not be specially recorded for an investigatory 
purpose. For example, this exception did not apply when a prison specially 
allowed a prisoner “to make the call . . . so that it could be monitored” and 
engaged in a recording technique that was not ordinarily used at the prison. 
Campiti v. Walonis, 611 F.2d 387, 392 (1st Cir. 1979).

B.  Disclosing an Intercepted Communication: 

18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(c)

The Wiretap Act also prohibits the intentional disclosure of communications 

that are known to have been illegally intercepted. 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(c).2 

Title 18, United States Code, Section 2511(1)(c) provides:
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who— 
 

intentionally  discloses, 

. . .
or 
(c) 
endeavors  to  disclose,  to  any  other 
person  the  contents  of  any  wire, 
oral,  or  electronic  communication, 
knowing or having reason to know 
that  the  information  was  obtained 
through the interception of a wire, 
oral,  or  electronic  communication 
in violation of this subsection . . .

2511(1)(c) Summary

1.  Intentional disclosure
2.  of illegally intercepted 
 
3.  knowledge or reason to know the 

communication

intercept was illegal

shall be punished as provided in subsection (4).

 

1.  Disclosure
The statute’s plain text prohibits the disclosure of the actual contents of 
a  communication.  In  addition,  courts  have  held  that  the  statute  prohibits 
disclosure of the “nature” of communications. See Deal v. Spears, 780 F. Supp. 
618, 624 (W.D. Ark. 1991), aff’d, 980 F.2d 1153 (8th Cir. 1992). However, 
disclosure of the mere fact that an illegal interception took place does not violate 
the prohibition on disclosure of the contents of intercepted communications. 
See Fultz v. Gilliam, 942 F.2d 396, 403 (6th Cir. 1991). In addition, disclosure 
of  the  contents  of  an  intercepted  communication  that  has  already  become 
“public information” or “common knowledge” is not prohibited. See S. Rep. 
No. 90-1097 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2181; Bartnicki 
v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 546 (2001) (“[O]ne cannot ‘disclose’ what is already 
in the public domain.”).

 
2 When a defendant discloses a communication that was intercepted legally, as part of a 
criminal investigation, and discloses the communication with the intent to obstruct the crimi-
nal investigation, they might be charged under section 2511(1)(e). Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 
2232(d) prohibits disclosing the fact that lawful interceptions are occurring.

2. Wiretap Act 

73

The disclosure must be to “any other person.” 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(c). In 
other words, the disclosure must be to a “third party” other than the person 
making  the  interception  or  the  parties  to  the  intercepted  communication. 
See Lanier v. Bryant, 332 F.3d 999, 1005 (6th Cir. 2003) (disclosure to an 
intercepted party and his attorney was not prohibited by 2511(1)(c)).

 

2. Mental state
Section 2511(1)(c) has two mental state requirements.
The act of disclosing a communication must be done “intentionally.” This 
is the same mental state requirement that is discussed above in connection with 
section 2511(1)(a).

The prosecution must also prove that the disclosing individual knew or had 
reason to know that the “information was obtained through the interception 
of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection.” 
18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(c). Thus, in a prosecution for disclosure, “knowledge or 
reason to know of the illegality is an element.” United States v. Wuliger, 981 
F.2d 1497, 1501 (6th Cir. 1992); see also Forsyth v. Barr, 19 F.3d 1527, 1538 
(5th  Cir.  1994)  (requiring  proof  “that  the  defendant  knew  or  should  have 
known that the interception was illegal”). Because the statute mentions “reason 
to know” of illegality, mistake of law is not a defense; the prosecution need 
show only that the defendant knew the relevant facts, not that the defendant 
understood the Wiretap Act well enough to know that the interception was 
unlawful. See Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1501; see also Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 
271,  284-85  (1st  Cir.  1993).  However,  a  prosecutor  should  be  prepared  to 
defeat any claim that the defendant was mistaken about any fact that would 
have authorized the interception. See id.

 

3.  Illegal Interception of Communication
Although the defendant need not be the individual who intercepted the 
communication,  in  most  cases  the  prosecution  must  prove  that  someone 
intercepted  a  covered  communication  in  violation  of  section  2511(1)(a), 
covered above. If a defendant both intercepted and disclosed a communication, 
it may be appropriate to charge the defendant with one count of interception 
and another count for disclosure.

One court, however, held the disclosure of a communication can be illegal 
even  when  the  interception  was  not.  Section  2511(1)(c)  requires  that  the 
disclosed information be obtained through an interception that was “in violation 

74  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

of this subsection.” (emphasis added). In Cafarelli v. Yancy, 226 F.3d 492 (6th 
Cir.  2000),  the  Sixth  Circuit  held  that  although  section  2511(2)(g)(ii)(II) 
permitted the “interception” of certain radio communications, it did not also 
permit their “disclosure.” Id. at 495. Even though section 2511(2) authorized 
the interception, the court interpreted section 2511(1)(c)’s reference to “this 
subsection”  to  exclude  consideration  of  the  many  exceptions  contained  in 
2511(2).  Thus,  2511(1)(c)’s  prohibition  on  “disclosure”  was  violated,  even 
though the interception was lawful. Id. at 495. Other courts have concluded 
otherwise, however. See United States v. Gass, 936 F. Supp. 810, 816 (N.D. 
Okla.  1996)  (“Since  it  is  not  a  violation  under  § 2511  to  intercept  readily 
accessible governmental radio communications, § 2511(1)(c) and (d) do not 
prohibit divulgence or use of such communications.”).

The Senate Report suggests an additional exception to the general rule that 
section 2511(1)(a) must have been violated. If a communication is intercepted, 
but  the  interception  does  not  violate  section  2511(1)(a)  only  because  the 
interception was not intentional, the Senate Report states that use or disclosure 
of the communication would still violate the Act. See S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 
25 (1986), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3579.

 

4.  First Amendment Concerns
The First Amendment prevents application of section 2511(1)(c) to the 
disclosure  of  information  of  public  concern  by  a  third  party  not  involved 
in  the  interception,  when  the  third  party  had  no  other  duty  to  keep  the 
information confidential. Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001); see also 
Jean v. Massachusetts State Police, 492 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir. 2007). In Bartnicki, 
several news organizations received a tape recording of a telephone conversation 
that  they  should  have  known  was  illegally  intercepted.  The  case  involved  a 
question  of  immunity  from  statutorily  imposed  civil  liability,  but  the  same 
First Amendment principles apply to criminal liability as well. The Supreme 
Court held that the disclosures by the news organizations were not unlawful.

Although  Bartnicki  demonstrates  that  the  First  Amendment  does  limit 
the applicability of section 2511(1)(c), the concurring opinions suggest that 
those  limits  are  very  narrow.  For  instance,  a  defendant  will  not  be  exempt 
from prosecution merely because he discloses information of interest to the 
public. Two  of  the  six  Justices  in  the  majority  in  Bartnicki  filed  a  separate 
concurring  opinion  that  makes  clear  that  a  majority  of  the  Court  rejects  a 

2. Wiretap Act 

75

blanket “public interest” exception to the disclosure provisions of the Wiretap 
Act. See Bartnicki, 532 U.S. at 540 (Breyer, J., concurring).

In concurring with the result in Bartnicki, Justice Breyer, with whom Justice 
O’Connor joined, agreed that privacy interests protected by section 2511(1)(c) 
must be balanced against media freedom embodied in the First Amendment. 
Justice Breyer wrote separately, however, to emphasize several facts he found 
particularly relevant in the case presented. In particular, he found that “the 
speakers had little or no legitimate interest in maintaining the privacy of the 
particular conversation.” Id. at 539 (emphasis in original). Justice Breyer based 
this conclusion on three factors: (1) the content of the communication, (2) the 
public status of the speaker, and (3) the method by which the communication 
was  transmitted.  According  to  Justice  Breyer,  the  conversation  intercepted 
involved threats to harm others, which the law has traditionally treated as not 
entitled to remain private. Moreover, Justice Breyer concluded that the speakers 
were “limited public figures.” Id. Finally, the speakers chose to communicate in 
what Justice Breyer viewed as an insecure method, via an unencrypted cellular 
telephone.  “Eavesdropping  on  ordinary  cellular  phone  conversations  in  the 
street  (which  many  callers  seem  to  tolerate)  is  a  very  different  matter  from 
eavesdropping on encrypted cellular phone conversations or those carried on 
in the bedroom.” Id. at 541.

Although  prosecutors  should  be  aware  of  the  First  Amendment  limits 
outlined in Bartnicki, the First Amendment will probably be implicated very 
rarely. In Bartnicki, the Supreme Court explicitly did not address cases where (1) 
the disclosing party participated in any illegality in obtaining the information, 
or (2) the disclosure is of “trade secrets or domestic gossip or other information 
of purely private concern.” Id. at 528, 533. In addition, the limits identified 
in Bartnicki explicitly do not apply to prosecutions under section 2511(1)(d) 
for using an illegally intercepted communication, which the Supreme Court 
expressly characterized as a regulation of conduct, not pure speech. See id. at 
526-27.

The First Amendment does not grant the news media a general defense 
to Wiretap Act violations. If this was not obvious from the care with which 
the  Supreme  Court  limited  the  exception  in  Bartnicki,  several  courts  have 
explicitly so held. See Peavy v. WFAA-TV, Inc., 221 F.3d 158 (5th Cir. 2000); 
Sussman v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 186 F.3d 1200 (9th Cir. 
1999); Vasquez-Santos v. El Mundo Broad. Corp., 219 F. Supp. 2d 221, 228 

76  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(D.P.R. 2002) (rejecting a blanket exemption from Wiretap Act liability for 
interceptions that occur for a tortious purpose during a media investigation). 
Thus,  not  everyone  “who  has  lawfully  obtained  truthful  information  of 
public importance has a First Amendment right to disclose that information.” 
Boehner v. McDermott, 484 F.3d 573, 577 (D.C. Cir. 2007). In Boehner, Jim 
McDermott,  a  member  of  Congress  and  of  the  House  Ethics  Committee, 
received  a  tape  of  an  illegally  intercepted  telephone  conversation  to  which 
John  Boehner,  another  member  of  Congress,  was  a  party.  McDermott 
disclosed  the  tape  to  the  media.  The  Court  held  that  McDermott  did  not 
have a First Amendment right to disclose the tape, because McDermott was 
subject to committee rule prohibiting disclosure of any evidence relating to an 
investigation to anyone outside the committee. Id.

C.  Using an Intercepted Communication: 

18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(d)

Like a violation of subsection (1)(c), a charge under section 2511(1)(d) has 
three elements. The first two elements are the same as in section 2511(1)(c) 
and present the same issues discussed above.

Title  18,  United  States  Code, 

Section 2511(1)(d) provides:

Except as otherwise specifically provided 
in  this  chapter  any  person  who— 
 

2511(1)(d) Summary

communication

1.  Illegal interception of  
 
2.  knowledge or reason to know the 

intercept was illegal
3. use of the contents.

. . .
(d) intentionally uses, or endeavors
to  use,  the  contents  of  any  wire, 
oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to 
know that the information was obtained through the interception 
of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this 
subsection . . .

shall be punished as provided in subsection (4).

 

1.  Use of contents
On its face, “use of the contents” of the intercepted communication appears 
extremely broad. However, “use” does require some “active employment of the 
contents of the illegally intercepted communication for some purpose.” Peavy 

2. Wiretap Act 

77

v. Harman, 37 F. Supp. 2d 495, 513 (N.D. Tex. 1999), aff’d in part and rev’d in 
part, 221 F.3d 258 (5th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, “use” does not include mere 
listening to intercepted conversations. See, e.g., Dorris v. Absher, 179 F.3d 420, 
426 (6th Cir. 1999); Reynolds v. Spears, 93 F.3d 428, 432-33 (8th Cir. 1996); 
Fields v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry. Co., 985 F. Supp. 1308 (D. Kan. 
1997), withdrawn in part, 5 F. Supp. 2d (D. Kan 1998). But see Thompson v. 
Dulaney, 838 F. Supp. 1535, 1547 (D. Utah 1993) (finding listening was a 
use).

Because  the  “use”  prohibition  regulates  conduct  rather  than  speech,  it 
may  reach  cases  that  would  otherwise  be  difficult  to  prosecute  due  to  First 
Amendment concerns. See Boehner v. McDermott, 484 F.3d 573, 583-84 (D.C. 
Cir. 2007) (recognizing distinction between prohibiting speech and prohibiting 
uses of information). For instance, a court has held that threatened disclosure 
in order to influence another is a “use.” See Leach v. Bryam, 68 F. Supp. 2d 1072 
(D. Minn. 1999). In the network context, other uses might include the use of 
intercepted passwords to gain access to other computers or use of intercepted 
confidential business information for commercial advantage.

D.  Statutory Exceptions and Defenses

The Wiretap Act has broad prohibitions in subsection 2511(1), but also has 
many exceptions in subsection 2511(2). A prosecutor should consider whether 
these exceptions apply in a particular case before undertaking a prosecution 
under the Wiretap Act. 

Each of the exceptions in section 2511(2) is an affirmative defense, not an 
element of any offense. See United States v. McCann, 465 F.2d 147, 162 (5th 
Cir. 1972); United States v. Harpel, 493 F.2d 346 (10th Cir. 1974). Because 
they are affirmative defenses, the government does not need to negate them in 
the charging document, see United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267, 288 (1970); 
McCann, 465 F.2d at 162, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction only 
if the theory is supported by the evidence, see United States v. Ricketts, 317 F.3d 
540 (6th Cir. 2003), and the defendant has the burden of proof at trial, see 
McCann, 465 F.2d at 162.

The  exceptions  that  are  particularly  relevant  in  the  context  of  network 

crimes are discussed below.

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

 

1.  Consent of a Party
An interception is lawful if the interceptor is a party to the communication, 
or if one of the parties to the communication consents to the interception. Two 
subsections in section 2511(2) embody this exception. Subsection 2511(2)(c) 
allows a “person acting under color of law” to intercept a communication with 
consent:

It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person acting 
under  color  of  law  to  intercept  a  wire,  oral,  or  electronic 
communication,  where  such  person  is  a  party  to  the 
communication or one of the parties to the communication 
has given prior consent to such interception.

18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(c).

Section  2511(2)(d)  uses  nearly  the  same  language  to  allow  persons  not 
acting “under color of law” to intercept a communication with consent, but 
provides  an  exception-to-the-exception:  the  interception  by  such  persons  is 
unlawful if “such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing 
any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the 
United States or of any State.” 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(d).

The consent exceptions under paragraphs 2511(2)(c) and (d) are perhaps 
the most frequently cited exceptions to the Wiretap Act’s general prohibition 
on intercepting communications.

 

“A party to the communication”

 
The Senate report for the Wiretap Act defined “party” as “the person actually 
participating in the communication.” S. Rep. No. 90-1097 (1968), reprinted in 
1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2182. Thus, a husband cannot “consent” to his own 
interception of his wife’s telephone calls to other people made with the marital 
home’s telephone. Simpson v. Simpson, 490 F.2d 803, 805 n.3 (5th Cir. 1974). 
However, when electronic communications are made using a server computer, 
some courts have suggested that a company that owns the server computer is a 
“party” to communications sent to those computers and is capable of consent. 
See United States v. Mullins, 992 F.2d 1472, 1478 (9th Cir. 1993) (company 
that owned a computer being communicated with was “one of the parties to the 
communication”); United States v. Seidlitz, 589 F.2d 152, 158 (4th Cir. 1978) 
(company that “leased, housed, programmed, and maintained the computers 

2. Wiretap Act 

79

and  subscribed  to  the  relevant  telephone  numbers,  was  for  all  intents  and 
purposes a party to the communications initiated by the defendant”). 

Individuals are parties to a communication when statements are directed 
at them, even if they do not respond, United States v. Pasha, 332 F.2d 193 
(7th  Cir.  1964)  (officer  who  answered  phone  during  execution  of  warrant 
on gambling establishment was party to statements placing bets), and even if 
they lie about their identity, United States v. Campagnuolo, 592 F.2d 852, 863 
(5th Cir. 1979) (officer who answered phone in gambling establishment and 
pretended to be defendant was a party). At least one court appears to have 
taken a broader approach, holding that someone whose presence is known to 
other communicants may be a party, even if the communicants do not address 
her, nor she them. See United States v. Tzakis, 736 F.2d 867, 871-72 (2d Cir. 
1984). In appropriate cases, however, prosecutors should consider charging an 
individual who overhears or records conversations between others who do not 
know that he is present, as such a person is not a party to the communication.
A  service  provider  generally  should  not  be  considered  a  party  to 
communications occurring on its system; a provider does not participate in 
the  communications  of  its  subscribers,  but  rather  merely  transmits  them. 
Indeed, if service providers were capable of consenting to the interception of 
communications as parties to communications occurring on their own systems, 
the exception that protects the rights and properties of service providers would 
be unnecessary. See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(a)(i).

 

Prior consent

 
Consent under subsections 2511(2)(c) and (d) may be explicit or implied. 
See United States v. Amen, 831 F.2d 373, 378 (2d Cir. 1987). Consent can 
be  implied  when  “surrounding  circumstances  indicat[e]  that  [the  party] 
knowingly agreed to the surveillance.” United States v. Amen, 831 F.2d 373, 
378 (2d Cir. 1987). Those circumstances generally require a showing that the 
consenting party received actual notice of the monitoring and chose to use 
the monitored system anyway. See United States v. Workman, 80 F.3d 688, 693 
(2d Cir. 1996); Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 116-17 (1st Cir. 1990) 
(“[I]mplied  consent  is  consent  in  fact  which  is  inferred  from  surrounding 
circumstances indicating that the party knowingly agreed to the surveillance.”) 
(internal quotation marks omitted); Berry v. Funk, 146 F.3d 1003, 1011 (D.C. 
Cir. 1998) (“Without actual notice, consent can only be implied when the 
surrounding  circumstances  convincingly  show  that  the  party  knew  about 

80  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

and consented to the interception.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). For 
example, a large number of courts have held that prisoners who voluntarily 
choose to use telephones that they know are being monitored have, by that 
choice, impliedly consented to interception of telephone calls made using that 
telephone. See, e.g., United States v. Verdin-Garcia, 516 F.3d 884, 894 (10th Cir. 
2008); United States v. Faulkner, 439 F.3d 1221, 1224 (10th Cir. 2006); United 
States v. Horr, 963 F.2d 1124, 1125 (8th Cir. 1992). However, “knowledge 
of the capability of monitoring alone cannot be considered implied consent,” 
especially when a party is told communications will not be monitored. Watkins 
v. L.M. Berry & Co., 704 F.2d 577, 581 (11th Cir. 1983); see also Deal v. Spears, 
980 F.2d 1153, 1157 (8th Cir. 1992) (finding lack of consent despite notice of 
possibility of monitoring).

Consent must be “actual” rather than “constructive.” See In re Pharmatrak, 
Inc. Privacy Litigation, 329 F.3d 9, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing cases). Proof 
of notice to the party generally supports the conclusion that the party knew 
of  the  monitoring.  See Workman,  80  F.3d.  at  693;  United  States  v.  Corona-
Chavez, 328 F.3d 974, 979 (8th Cir. 2003) (“[i]f Munoz was required to place 
a mechanical device into her ear in order to record the conversation, there can 
be little doubt that she was aware the conversation was being intercepted”). 
Absent proof of notice, it must be “convincingly” shown that the party knew 
about the interception based on surrounding circumstances in order to support 
a finding of implied consent. See United States v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966, 981 (1st 
Cir. 1995).

One way of proving actual notice is a network banner alerting the user 
that  communications  on  the  network  are  monitored  and  intercepted;  this 
banner may be used to demonstrate that a user furnished consent to intercept 
communications on that network. United States v. Angevine, 281 F.3d 1130, 
1133  (10th  Cir.  2002);  Muick  v.  Glenayre  Elecs.,  280  F.3d  741,  743  (7th 
Cir. 2002); United States v. Simons, 206 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir. 2000). For 
example,  an  employee  that  knew  about  a  monitoring  policy  and  was  daily 
reminded of it through a warning notice was held to have impliedly consented 
to having his email monitored by his employer. Sporer v. UAL Corp., 2009 WL 
2761329, at *6 (N.D. Cal. 2009). Generally, network banners do not require 
users to consent to the monitoring of their communications by just anyone, 
but, rather, only by their employer or by the owner of the computer network. If 
a defendant intercepts communications, and cannot claim to be among the set 

2. Wiretap Act 

81

of persons authorized to do so by the banner, then the defendant cannot argue 
that the banner constituted consent to the interception.

 

Acting under color of law

 
Section 2511(2)(c) applies only when the person making the interception 
is “acting under color of law.” If this is not the case, then section 2511(2)(d) 
may still apply.

Government employees are not “acting under color of law” merely because 
they are government employees. See Thomas v. Pearl, 998 F.2d 447, 451 (7th 
Cir. 1993). Whether an individual is “acting under color of law” depends on 
whether  the  individual  was  acting  under  the  government’s  direction  when 
conducting the interception. See United States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 660 
(7th Cir. 2000); United States v. Craig, 573 F.2d 455, 476 (7th Cir, 1977); see 
also Obron Atlantic Corp. v. Barr, 990 F.2d 861, 864 (6th Cir. 1993); United 
States v. Tousant, 619 F.2d 810, 813 (9th Cir. 1980). The fact that a party to 
whom consent is provided is secretly cooperating with the government does 
not vitiate consent under paragraph 2511(2)(c). United States v. Shields, 675 
F.2d 1152, 1156-57 (11th Cir. 1982).

 

Purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act

 
Section 2511(2)(d) applies when the person making the interception is not 
“acting under color of law,” but it contains an exception-to-the-exception that 
section 2511(2)(c) does not: the interception is unlawful if the person making 
the interception acts “for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious 
act  in  violation  of  the  Constitution  or  laws  of  the  United  States  or  of  any 
State.” 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(d); see also Payne v. Norwest Corp., 911 F. Supp. 
1299, 1303 (D. Mont. 1995) (applying exception absent evidence of criminal 
or tortious purpose for recording of conversations), rev’d on other grounds, 113 
F.3d 1079 (9th Cir. 1997).

Congress intended this exception-to-the-exception to prohibit interception 
done for the purpose of injuring someone else, to the extent that injury was 
independently prohibited by some other applicable law. See, e.g., Simpson v. 
Simpson,  490  F.2d  803,  805  n.3  (5th  Cir.  1974)  (tortious  or  criminal  acts 
can  include  “blackmailing  the  other  party,  threatening  him,  or  publicly 
embarrassing him”). Whether an “act” is in violation of a criminal law or a tort 
can, of course, be decided on a case-by-case basis only. A prosecutor should 
particularly consider applicable state torts governing invasions of privacy.

82  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

In assessing the purpose of the interception, courts look to the intended 
use of the interception. In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., 216 
F.3d 621, 626 (7th Cir. 2000). It is possible that an interception is motivated 
by several purposes, some lawful and some unlawful. For example, a journalist 
might record a conversation for purposes of both reporting on a story (a lawful 
purpose) and invading privacy (an unlawful purpose). See Sussman v. American 
Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 186 F.3d 1200, 1202 (9th Cir. 1999). In such a 
case, “[t]he existence of the lawful purpose would not sanitize a tape that was 
also made for an illegitimate purpose; the taping would violate section 2511.”

2.  Provider Exception
The Wiretap Act provides that:

It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an operator of a 
switchboard, or an officer, employee, or agent of a provider of 
a wire or electronic communication service, whose facilities are 
used in the transmission of a wire or electronic communication, 
to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal 
course of his employment while engaged in any activity which 
is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the 
protection  of  the  rights  or  property  of  the  provider  of  that 
service, except that a provider of wire communication service 
to  the  public  shall  not  utilize  service  observing  or  random 
monitoring  except  for  mechanical  or  service  quality  control 
checks. 

18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(a)(i).

The  “rights  or  property  of  the  provider”  clause  of  section  2511(2)(a)(i) 
grants providers the right “to intercept and monitor [communications] placed 
over their facilities in order to combat fraud and theft of service.” United States v. 
Villanueva, 32 F. Supp. 2d 635, 639 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). For example, employees 
of a cellular phone company may intercept communications from an illegally 
“cloned” cell phone in the course of locating its source. See United States v. 
Pervaz, 118 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997). The exception also permits providers 
to monitor misuse of a system in order to protect the system from damage or 
invasions of privacy. For example, system administrators can track intruders 
within their networks in order to prevent further damage. See United States 
v. Mullins, 992 F.2d 1472, 1478 (9th Cir. 1993) (need to monitor misuse of 

2. Wiretap Act 

83

computer system justified interception of electronic communications pursuant 
to section 2511(2)(a)(i)).

Importantly, the rights and property clause of the provider exception does 
not permit providers to conduct unlimited monitoring. See United States v. Auler, 
539 F.2d 642, 646 (7th Cir. 1976). Instead, the exception permits providers 
and their agents to conduct reasonable monitoring that balances the providers’ 
needs to protect their rights and property with their subscribers’ right to privacy 
in their communications. See United States v. Harvey, 540 F.2d 1345, 1351 
(8th Cir. 1976) (“The federal courts . . . have construed the statute to impose 
a standard of reasonableness upon the investigating communication carrier.”); 
United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 82 (1st Cir. 2005) (“indisputable” 
that provider exception did not permit provider to read customer email when 
done in the hope of gaining a commercial advantage).

Thus, providers investigating unauthorized use of their systems have broad 
authority to monitor and disclose evidence of unauthorized use under subsection 
2511(2)(a)(i), but they should attempt to tailor their monitoring and disclosure 
to  minimize  the  interception  and  disclosure  of  private  communications 
unrelated  to  the  investigation.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Freeman,  524  F.2d 
337,  341  (7th  Cir.  1975)  (concluding  that  phone  company  investigating 
use of illegal devices designed to steal long-distance service acted permissibly 
under § 2511(2)(a)(i) when it intercepted the first two minutes of every illegal 
conversation but did not intercept legitimately authorized communications). 
In particular, there must be a “substantial nexus” between the monitoring and 
the threat to the provider’s rights or property. United States v. McLaren, 957 F. 
Supp. 215, 219 (M.D. Fla. 1997); see Bubis v. United States, 384 F.2d 643, 648 
(9th Cir. 1967) (interpreting Title III’s predecessor statute, 47 U.S.C. § 605, 
and holding impermissible use of far-reaching provider interceptions to convict 
unauthorized user of interstate transmission of wagering information). 

The “normal course of his employment” and “necessary to the rendition 
of  his  service”  clauses  of  § 2511(2)(a)(i)  provide  additional  contexts  in 
which the provider exception applies. Courts have held that the first of these 
exceptions authorizes a business to receive email sent to an account provided 
by the business to a former employee or to an account associated with a newly 
acquired business. See Freedom Calls Found. v. Bukstel, 2006 WL 845509, at 
*27 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (employer entitled in the normal course of business to 
intercept emails sent to account of former employee because “monitoring is 
necessary to ensure that . . . email messages are answered in a timely fashion”); 

84  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

Ideal Aerosmith, Inc. v. Acutronic USA, Inc., 2007 WL 4394447, at *5-6 (E.D. 
Pa. 2007) (corporation entitled in the normal course of business to intercept 
emails  sent  to  business  it  acquired).  The  “necessary  to  the  rendition  of  his 
service” clause permits providers to intercept, use, or disclose communications 
in the ordinary course of business when the interception is unavoidable. See 
United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 168 n.13 (1977) (noting that 
§ 2511(2)(a)(i) “excludes all normal telephone company business practices” 
from  the  prohibition  of Title  III).  These  cases  generally  arose  when  analog 
phone  lines  were  in  use.  For  example,  a  switchboard  operator  may  briefly 
overhear conversations when connecting calls. See, e.g., United States v. Savage, 
564 F.2d 728, 731-32 (5th Cir. 1977); Adams v. Sumner, 39 F.3d 933, 935 (9th 
Cir. 1994). Similarly, repair personnel may overhear snippets of conversations 
in the course of repairs. See United States v. Ross, 713 F.2d 389, 392 (8th Cir. 
1983). These cases concerning wire communications suggest that the “necessary 
incident  to  the  rendition  of  his  service”  language  would  likewise  permit  a 
system administrator to intercept communications in the course of repairing 
or maintaining a computer network.

For a more thorough discussion of this exception, see U.S. Department 
of Justice, Searching and Seizing Computers and Electronic Evidence (Office of 
Legal Education 2009). 

 

3.  Good faith
Section 2520(d) provides three related “good faith” defenses:
(d) Defense.—A good faith reliance on—

(1) a court warrant or order, a grand jury subpoena, a legislative 
authorization, or a statutory authorization; 
(2) a request of an investigative or law enforcement officer under 
section 2518(7) of this title; or 
(3) a good faith determination that section 2511(3) or 2511(2)(i) 
of this title permitted the conduct complained of; 

is a complete defense against any civil or criminal action brought under this 
chapter or any other law.
The  “good  faith”  defenses  in  section  2520  prevent  prosecution  of  a 
defendant who relied in good faith on the listed types of lawful process (e.g., 
warrants, court orders, grand jury subpoenas) or an emergency request (under 

2. Wiretap Act 

85

18 U.S.C. § 2518(7)). These defenses are most commonly applicable to law 
enforcement officers executing legal process and service providers complying 
with legal process, even if the process later turns out to be deficient in some 
manner.  They  apply  even  when  defendants  rely  upon  convincingly  forged 
subpoenas. See McCready v. eBay, Inc., 453 F.3d 882, 892 (7th Cir. 2006). 

The final subsection of section 2520(d) provides that “good faith reliance” 
on  “a  good  faith  determination  that  section  2511(3)  .  .  .  permitted  the 
conduct  complained  of”  is  a  “complete  defense.”  18  U.S.C.  § 2520(d)(3). 
Section 2511(3) permits a provider of electronic communication service to the 
public to divulge the contents of communications under certain enumerated 
circumstances. Thus, some good faith mistakes of law are a defense for providers 
of electronic communication service to the public under subsection 2520(d)(3). 
See United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2005) (“Congress 
contemplated that service providers might, in good faith, misunderstand the 
limits of their authority on a particular set of facts, and provided a statutory 
mechanism to solve this problem.”).

 

4.  The “Accessible to the Public” Exception, 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(g)
Section  2511(2)(g)(i)  permits  “any  person”  to  intercept  an  electronic 
communication made through an electronic communication system “that is 
configured so that . . . [the] communication is readily accessible to the general 
public.”  Congress  intended  this  language  to  permit  the  interception  of  an 
electronic communication that has been posted to a public bulletin board, a 
public chat room, or a Usenet newsgroup. See S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 36 (1986), 
reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3590 (discussing bulletin boards). “No 
expectation of privacy attaches to electronic communications made available 
through  facilities  readily  available  to  the  public,  and  interception  of  such 
communications is also expressly permitted under the Wiretap Act.” Konop v. 
Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 236 F.3d 1035, 1045 (9th Cir. 2001). This exception 
may apply even if users are required to register and agree to terms of use in 
order to access the communication. See Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., 450 F.3d 1314, 
1321-22  (11th  Cir.  2006)  (electronic  bulletin  board  that  required  visitors 
to register, obtain a password, and certify that they were not associated with 
DirecTV was accessible to the public). Notably, section 2511(2)(g)(i) applies 
only to electronic communications.

When  an  electronic  communication  is  sent  by  radio—as  with  satellite 
communications  or  a  wireless  network—special  rules  apply.  Even  though 

86  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

any  nearby  antenna  can  receive  radio  transmissions,  not  all  electronic 
communications  sent  by  radio  are  “readily  accessible  to  the  general  public” 
under section 2511(2)(g)(i). Section 2510(16) defines “readily accessible to the 
general public” with respect to radio communications. Encrypted electronic 
communications  sent  over  radio  are  not  “readily  accessible  to  the  general 
public.”  18  U.S.C.  §  2510(16)(A);  United  States  v.  Shriver,  989  F.2d  898 
(7th Cir. 1992). Section 2510(16) lists several other protected transmission 
techniques and frequencies, each technology-specific. 

Section 2511(2)(g)(ii) addresses both wire and electronic communications 
sent by radio. It exempts some of those communications from the Wiretap 
Act’s protections. Radio transmissions sent from “any station for the use of 
the  general  public,”  such  as  FM  and  AM  radio  stations,  are  not  protected. 
18  U.S.C.  §  2511(2)(g)(ii)(I).  Radio  transmissions  transmitted  “by  any 
governmental, law enforcement, civil defense, private land mobile, or public 
safety communications system, including police and fire, readily accessible to the 
general public,” such as police-band radio transmissions, are also unprotected. 
Id. at § 2511(2)(g)(ii)(II); United States v. Gass, 936 F. Supp. 810, 816 (N.D. 
Okla. 1996) (“If a governmental radio communication is ‘readily accessible to 
the general public,’ then where is the harm in intercepting it and divulging the 
contents of the communication?”). However, when law enforcement uses an 
electronic communication system that is not a public safety system, such as a 
private pager system, this exception does not apply. See United States v. Sills, 
2000 WL 511025, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).

E. 

Statutory Penalties

A  Wiretap  Act  violation  is  a  Class  D  felony;  the  maximum  authorized 
penalties for a violation of section 2511(1) of the Wiretap Act are imprisonment 
of not more than five years and a fine under Title 18. 18 U.S.C. §§ 2511(4)
(a)  (setting  penalties),  3559(a)(4)  (classifying  sentence).  Authorized  fines 
are  typically  not  more  than  $250,000  for  individuals  or  $500,000  for  an 
organization, unless there is a substantial loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3571 (setting fines 
for felonies). Generally applicable special assessments and terms of supervised 
release  also  apply.  18  U.S.C.  § 3013(a)(2)  (setting  special  assessments  for 
felonies at $100 for individuals; $400 for persons other than individuals), 18 
U.S.C. § 3583(b)(2) (allowing imposition of a term of supervised release not 
more than three years for a Class D felony). For a discussion of the Sentencing 
Guidelines applicable to Wiretap Act violations, please see Chapter 5.

A.  Unlawful Access to Stored Communications: 

18 U.S.C. § 2701

Section 2701 focuses on protecting email and voicemail from unauthorized 
access. See H.R. Rep. No. 647, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 63 (1986). At heart, 
section  2701  protects  the  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  of  these 
communications  stored  by  providers  of  electronic  communication  services 
pending the ultimate delivery to their intended recipients.

A  charge  under

1.  Intentional Access
The mens rea element of a section 2701 violation is that the defendant’s 
unauthorized  access  (or  access  in  excess  of  authorization)  was  intentional. 
Although  no  court  has  analyzed  the  mens  rea  requirement  for  this  section, 
courts  have  addressed  the  mens  rea  requirement  for  similar  language  in  18 
U.S.C.  § 1030.  See  United  States  v.  Sablan,  92  F.3d  865,  867-68  (9th  Cir. 
1996); United States v. Morris, 928 F.2d 504, 508-09 (2d Cir. 1991). In Sablan, 
the Ninth Circuit analyzed the wording, structure, and purpose of what was 
then section 1030(a)(5)(A) and concluded that the “intentionally” language 
modified  only  the  “accesses  without  authorization”  portion  of  that  statute. 
Sablan, 92 F.3d at 868. The same reasoning applies to section 2701.

The  statute  does  not  define  the  term  “access”;  please  see  page  37  for 
a discussion of this term under section 1030. In a typical criminal case, in 
which a defendant will have logged on to a system and obtained, altered, or 
deleted email or voicemail, there will be no question that the defendant has 
intentionally accessed a facility.

 

2.  Without or In Excess of Authorization
The  second  element  of  section 2701  requires  proof  that  the  defendant 
either was not authorized to access the facility or that the defendant exceeded 
authorized  access.  This  element  mirrors  the  “without  authorization”  and 
“exceeds authorized access” language of 18 U.S.C. § 1030. For the discussion 
of the meaning of these terms, please see page 5.

 
 

3.  Facility Through Which an Electronic 
  Communication Service Is Provided
The third element of a section 2701 violation is that the defendant accessed 
a  facility  through  which  an  electronic  communication  service  (ECS)  was 
provided. An ECS is “any service which provides to users thereof the ability to 
send or receive wire or electronic communications.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15). In 
other words, an ECS is a facility that others use to transmit communications 
to  third  parties.  Section  2701  incorporates  that  definition.  See  18  U.S.C. 
§ 2711(1). “[T]elephone companies and electronic mail companies” generally 
act  as  providers  of  electronic  communication  services.  See  S.  Rep.  No.  99-
541  (1986),  reprinted  in  1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.  3555,  3568.  A  provider  of 
email  accounts  over  the  Internet  is  a  provider  of  ECS,  see  FTC  v.  Netscape 
Communications Corp., 196 F.R.D. 559, 560 (N.D. Cal. 2000), as is the host 

90  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

of an electronic bulletin board. See Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 302 F.3d 
868, 879-80 (9th Cir. 2002). Thus, computers that provide such services are 
facilities through which an ECS is provided. See Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., 450 
F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006) (upholding a dismissal for failure to state a claim, 
where defendants used computers to access a website generally available to the 
public).

However, not every computer or device connected to a communication 
system is a facility through which an ECS is provided: a computer or device 
belonging to an end-user of an ECS is not such a facility. For example, the 
Eleventh  Circuit  has  held  that  hacking  into  a  home  computer  does  not 
implicate section 2701 because a home computer generally does not provide 
an ECS to others. See United States v. Steiger, 318 F.3d 1039, 1049 (11th Cir. 
2003). Similarly, the court in State Wide Photocopy Corp. v. Tokai Fin. Services, 
Inc., 909 F. Supp. 137, 145 (S.D.N.Y. 1995), and the mere use of business 
computers and fax machines does not necessarily constitute the activity of an 
ECS. Courts have also rejected the notion that maintaining a website or merely 
utilizing Internet access constitutes providing an ECS. See Dyer v. Northwest 
Airlines  Corp.,  334  F.  Supp.  2d  1196,  1999  (D.N.D.  2004)  (airline  selling 
travel services over the Internet is not a provider of ECS); Crowley v. Cybersource 
Corp., 166 F. Supp. 2d 1263, 1270 (N.D. Cal. 2001) (Amazon.com is not a 
provider of ECS).

 
 

to a Communication in Electronic Storage

4.  Obtained, Altered, or Prevented Authorized Access 
 
The  fourth  element  of  a  section 2701  violation  is  that  the  defendant 
obtained,  altered,  or  prevented  authorized  access  to  a  wire  or  electronic 
communication  while  it  was  in  “electronic  storage.”  This  element  has  three 
components. The first component, that the defendant “obtained, altered, or 
prevented authorized access to,” means that a defendant must acquire a stored 
communication, modify a stored communication, or prevent proper access to 
a stored communication.

The Ninth Circuit, when distinguishing access under section 2701 from 
an  interception  under  the  Wiretap  Act,  misinterpreted  this  component.  In 
United  States  v.  Smith,  155  F.3d  1051  (9th  Cir.  1998),  the  Ninth  Circuit 
stated that “[t]he word ‘intercept’ entails actually acquiring the contents of a 
communication, whereas the word ‘access’ merely involves being in position to 
acquire the contents of a communication.” Smith, 155 F.3d at 1058 (emphasis 

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

91

in original). It then opined that one might violate section 2701 by using a 
purloined password to log on to a voicemail system without ever obtaining 
the contents of any voicemail. See id. This reading of the statute should be 
given  little  weight.  Not  only  did  the  Court’s  reasoning  rely  on  an  effort  to 
give meaning to text in the Wiretap Act that Congress has since repealed (18 
U.S.C. § 2510(1)), see USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 209(1)(A), 
but it ignores this element of the offense—i.e., that the communication be 
“obtained,” “altered,” or made unavailable.

The second component, that the conduct involved a “wire or electronic 
communication,” needs little further explanation. Wire communications are 
essentially communications containing the human voice that are transmitted 
in  part  by  a  wire  or  other  similar  method.  See  18  U.S.C.  § 2510(1),  (18). 
In  addition,  “electronic  communication”  is  defined  broadly  in  18  U.S.C. 
§ 2510(12) and includes most electric or electronic signals that are not wire 
communications. For example, voicemail is a wire communication, and email 
and other typical Internet communications that do not contain the human 
voice are electronic communications.

The final component of this element is that the communication was in 
“electronic  storage.”  The  term  “electronic  storage”  has  a  narrow,  statutorily 
defined meaning; it does not simply mean storage of information by electronic 
means. Instead, “electronic storage” means “(A) any temporary, intermediate 
storage  of  a  wire  or  electronic  communication  incidental  to  the  electronic 
transmission  thereof;  and  (B)  any  storage  of  such  communication  by  an 
electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection of such 
communication.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17). As traditionally understood by the 
government, “electronic storage” refers only to temporary storage, made in the 
course of transmission, by a provider of electronic communications service and 
to backups of such intermediate communications. If the communication has 
been received by a recipient’s service provider but has not yet been accessed 
by the recipient, it is in “electronic storage.” For example, a copy of an email 
or voicemail is in “electronic storage” only if it is at an intermediate point in 
its transmission and has not yet been retrieved by its intended recipient (e.g., 
undelivered email). When the recipient retrieves the email or voicemail, the 
communication reaches its final destination. If the recipient chooses to retain 
a copy of the communication on the service provider’s system, the retained 
copy is no longer in “electronic storage” because it is no longer in “temporary, 
intermediate storage . . . incidental to . . . electronic transmission,” and neither 

92  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

is it a backup of such a communication. See Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 
135 F. Supp. 2d 623, 635-36 (E.D. Pa. 2001), aff’d in part, 352 F.3d 107, 114 
(3d Cir. 2004). Instead, it is treated like any other material stored by a user 
under provisions governing remote computing services. See H.R. Rep. No. 647, 
99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 65 (1986) (stating that when a recipient has retrieved 
an email message and chooses to leave it in storage with the service provider, 
the email is protected under a provision of 18 U.S.C. § 2702 applicable to 
remote computing services).

The Ninth Circuit in Theofel v. Farey-Jones, 359 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir. 2004), 
rejected  this  long-standing  narrow  interpretation  of  “electronic  storage.”  In 
Theofel, the Ninth Circuit held that email messages were in electronic storage 
regardless of whether they had been previously accessed. Although the Ninth 
Circuit did not dispute that previously accessed email was not in temporary, 
intermediate storage  within the  meaning of section 2510(17)(A), it insisted 
that previously accessed email fell within the scope of the “backup” portion of 
the definition of “electronic storage.” Id. at 1075. Under Theofel, essentially all 
stored wire or electronic communications are in “electronic storage.” Although 
prosecutors within the Ninth Circuit are bound by Theofel, law enforcement 
elsewhere  may  continue  to  apply  the  traditional  narrow  interpretation  of 
“electronic storage,” even when the data sought is within the Ninth Circuit. 
Recent lower court decisions addressing the scope of “electronic storage” have 
split between the traditional interpretation and the Theofel approach. Compare 
United States v. Weaver, 636 F. Supp. 2d 769, 772-73 (C.D. Ill. 2009) (rejecting 
Theofel), and Bansal v. Russ, 513 F. Supp. 2d 264, 276 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (holding 
that access to opened email in account held by non-public service provider did 
not violate the Stored Communications Act), with Bailey v. Bailey, 2008 WL 
324156, at *6 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 6, 2008) (endorsing Theofel), and Cardinal 
Health 414, Inc. v. Adams, 582 F. Supp. 2d 967, 976 n.2 (M.D. Tenn. 2008) 
(same).

If  Theofel’s  broad  interpretation  of  “electronic  storage”  were  correct, 
prosecutions under section 2701 would be substantially less difficult, as it can 
be difficult to prove that communications fall within the traditional narrow 
interpretation of “electronic storage” in some cases. However, CCIPS continues 
to question whether Theofel was correctly decided, since little reason exists for 
treating old email differently than other material a user may choose to store 
on a network. If you are considering a prosecution under section 2701 that 

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

93

relies on the interpretation used in Theofel, we urge you to contact CCIPS for 
consultation.

 

5.  Purpose
Felony charges require proof of one additional element: that the defendant 
acted “for purposes of commercial advantage, malicious destruction or damage, 
or private commercial gain, or in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act.” 18 
U.S.C. § 2701(b)(1).1 The Wiretap Act also uses such language as an exception 
to when a party may consent to interception of their communications. See 18 
U.S.C. § 2511(2)(d). In the Wiretap Act context, one appellate court has stated 
that this language is operative when a prohibited purpose is either the subject’s 
primary motivation or a determinative factor in the subject’s motivation. See 
United  States  v.  Cassiere,  4  F.3d  1006,  1021  (1st  Cir.  1993).  Naturally,  the 
wording “in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act” means an act other 
than the unlawful access to stored communications itself. See Boddie v. American 
Broadcasting Co., 731 F.2d 333, 339 (6th Cir. 1984).

 

6.  Exceptions
Section 2701(c) provides three statutory exceptions to a violation. First, the 
section does not apply to “the person or entity providing a wire or electronic 
communication service.” 18 U.S.C. § 2701(c)(1). Thus, unlike in the Wiretap 
Act context, service providers cannot violate section 2701, regardless of their 
motives in accessing stored communications. See United States v. Councilman, 
418 F.3d 67, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2004) (en banc). Second, the section does not 
apply to conduct authorized by a user “with respect to a communication of 
or  intended  for  that  user.”  18  U.S.C.  § 2701(c)(2).  See  Konop  v.  Hawaiian 
Airlines, Inc., 302 F.3d 868, 880 (9th Cir. 2002) (interpreting “user” narrowly 
to  exclude  someone  who  was  properly  authorized  to  access  an  electronic 
bulletin board, but who had not actually done so). Third, section 2701 does 
not apply to conduct authorized by other sections of the Act or the Wiretap 
Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 2701(c)(3). Although no court has yet addressed the role 
of these exceptions in a criminal prosecution, prosecutors should treat them 
as creating affirmative defenses rather than statutory elements to be negated. 
See generally United States v. Kloess, 251 F.3d 941, 944-46 (11th Cir. 2001) 

 
1 Similar language appears in the CFAA, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(B), to enhance the pen-
alty for a violation of § 1030(a)(2), which criminalizes accessing a computer without authori-
zation or in excess of authorization.

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(discussing distinctions between elements of a crime and affirmative defenses 
created by statutory exceptions). 

 

7.  Penalties
The penalties for unlawful access to stored communications fall into three 
categories.  For  first-time  violations  not  committed  for  a  specified  improper 
purpose  (that  is,  not  committed  “for  purposes  of  commercial  advantage, 
malicious destruction or damage, or private commercial gain, or in furtherance 
of any criminal or tortious act”), the maximum penalty is one year imprisonment 
and a $100,000 fine. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701(b)(2)(A), 3571(b)(5). For repeat 
violations not committed for an improper purpose, or for first-time violations 
committed  for  an  improper  purpose,  the  maximum  penalty  is  five  years’ 
imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701(b)(1)(A), (b)(2)(B), 
3571(b)(3).  For  repeat  violations  committed  for  an  improper  purpose,  the 
maximum  penalty  is  ten  years’  imprisonment  and  a  $250,000  fine.  See  18 
U.S.C. §§ 2701(b)(1)(B), 3571(b)(3). 

 

8.  Historical Notes
Since its enactment in 1986, there have been very few prosecutions under 
section 2701. There are at least three reasons for this lack. First, prior to the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002), 
all first-time violations of this section were misdemeanors. That Act, however, 
increased  the  maximum  penalty  for  first-time  violations  to  five  years  when 
the  offense  is  committed  “for  purposes  of  commercial  advantage,  malicious 
destruction  or  damage,  or  private  commercial  gain,  or  in  furtherance  of 
any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the 
United States or any State.” 18 U.S.C. § 2701(b)(1). Second, one element of 
prosecutions can be difficult to prove: that the defendant obtained, altered, or 
prevented authorized access to communications in “electronic storage,” a term 
that is narrowly defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17) and that has traditionally 
been  interpreted  to  include  only  communications  that  have  not  yet  been 
accessed by their intended recipient. Third, many violations of section 2701 
also  involve  conduct  that  violates  18  U.S.C.  § 1030.  Because  prosecutions 
under section 1030 do not involve proof that a communication is in “electronic 
storage,”  it  will  often  be  easier  for  the  government  to  prove  a  violation  of 
section 1030 than section 2701.

B. 
 

Identity Theft: 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7)

1.  Application to Network Crimes
Network  intrusions  can  compromise  the  privacy  of  individuals  if  data 
about  them  or  their  transactions  resides  on  the  victim  network.  Such  cases 
commonly also involve violations of identity theft statutes. For a more detailed 
treatment of identity theft, see U.S. Department of Justice, Identity Theft and 
Social Security Fraud (Office of Legal Education 2004).

Several federal laws apply to identity theft, including 18 U.S.C. § 1028. 
That  section  criminalizes  eight  types  of  conduct  involving  fraudulent 
identification  documents  or  the  unlawful  use  of  identification  information. 
Section  1028(a)(7),  enacted  as  part  of  the  Identity  Theft  and  Assumption 
Deterrence Act of 1998 and amended in 2004 by the Identity Theft Penalty 
Enhancement Act, will apply to some network crime cases. See, e.g., United 
States v. Sutcliffe, 505 F.3d 944 (9th Cir. 2007) (affirming conviction under 
section 1028(a)(7) for posting stolen social security numbers on website).

Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028(a)(7) provides:
 Whoever, in a circumstance described in subsection (c) of this section—

 . . .
(7)  knowingly  transfers,  possesses,  or  uses,  without  lawful 
authority,  a  means  of  identification  of  another  person  with  the 
intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any 
unlawful  activity  that  constitutes  a  violation  of  Federal  law,  or 
that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law . . . 
shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

“Person,” as it is used in the statute, refers to individuals both living and 
dead. See United States v. Kowal, 527 F.3d 741, 745-77 (8th Cir. 2008); United 
States v. Jiminez, 507 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 2007) (“[T]he natural reading of the 
word ‘person’ in the phrase ‘means of identification of another person’ includes 
persons deceased.”); United States v. Maciel-Alcala, 2008 WL 4369299, at *2-
3 (C.D. Cal. 2008); United States v. Shain, 2008 WL 2940641, at *1 (W.D. 
Wash. 2008).2 

 
2 Although the cases cited here interpreted the scope of “person” with regard to section 
1028A, section 1028(a)(7) mirrors the relevant language of section 1028A. Compare 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1028(a)(7) (“Whoever. . .knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, 
a means of identification of another person”) with 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1) (same). Further-

96  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

The  term  “means  of  identification”  refers  to  “any  name  or  number 
that  may  be  used,  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  any  other  information,  to 
identify a specific individual.” 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7). The statute provides 
several specific examples, such as name; social security number, date of birth, 
government issued driver’s license, and other numbers; unique biometric data, 
such as fingerprints, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical 
representation;  unique  electronic  identification  number,  address,  or  routing 
code; and telecommunication identifying information or access device. Id. 

There is little controversy about classifying a unique identifier, such as a 
social security number, as a “means of identification.” However, courts disagree 
about whether non-unique identifiers—including those, such as names and 
birthdates, that are included in the statutory definition—qualify as a “means of 
identification” when standing alone. Under one reading, the answer is yes—a 
piece of information is a “means of identification,” even if it does not pinpoint 
a specific person on its own, as long as the information could potentially be 
coupled with other information to do so. See 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7) (means of 
identification includes names or numbers that “may be used . . . in conjunction 
with other information [] to identify a specific individual”) (emphasis added). 
In  accordance  with  this  interpretation,  several  courts  have  indicated  that  a 
name, standing alone, constitutes a “means of identification.” See United States 
v. Silva, 554 F.3d 13, 23 n.14 (1st Cir. 2009) (defendant’s argument that forged 
doctor’s signature did not constitute “means of identification” “runs afoul of 
the plain language of the statute,” which specifies that “any . . . name” is within 
scope of definition) (omission in original); United States v. Blixt, 548 F.3d 882, 
886 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[W]e hold . . . that forging another’s signature constitutes 
the use of that person’s name and thus qualifies as a ‘means of identification.’”); 
United States v. Hanson, 2009 WL 2460887, at *5 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (“As the 
statutory definition makes clear, a name alone is a ‘means of identification.’”).
On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit has held that non-unique identifiers 
are not “means of identification” unless they are actually used in conjunction 
with additional information that permits the identification of a specific person. 
See United States v. Mitchell, 518 F.3d 230 (4th Cir. 2008). In Mitchell, the 
defendant possessed a false Georgia driver’s license bearing the name Marcus 

more, the two statutes share the same definition of “means of identification,” see 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1028(d)(7), and are aimed at the same category of conduct. Accordingly, the proper inter-
pretation of “means of identification of another person” should be the same for both statutes.

Jackson. Other people in the state of Georgia had this name, and the defendant 
selected it after seeing it in a phone book. However, the additional information 
on the license, such as address and date of birth, did not match those of any 
actual Marcus Jackson. Id. at 232-33. The court reasoned, “[T]he distinguishing 
feature of a means of identification of another person is that it must identify a 
specific individual,” id. at 235, whereas names or dates of birth are “likely not ... 
sufficiently unique to identify a specific individual because many persons have 
the same [one,]” id. at 234. Because the information used by the defendant, 
taken as a whole, did not identify a specific person, the court held that the 
defendant did not use a “means of identification” and reversed his conviction. 
Id. at 236; see also id. at 234 (non-unique identifiers listed in the statutory 
definition, such as names, do not “qualify as a means of identification” unless 
“coupled with other information to identify a specific individual”).3 

In any event, prosecutors pursuing charges under section 1028(a)(7) must 
be careful to ensure that the evidence will permit them to meet their burden 
with  regard  to  intent.  In  Flores-Figueroa  v.  United  States,  129  S.  Ct.  1886, 
1889 (2009), the Supreme Court held that section 1028A, which criminalizes 
“knowingly transfer[ing], possess[ing], or us[ing], without lawful authority, a 
means of identification of another person,” requires the government to show 
that “the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to 
another person.” Id. at 1894. Because section 1028(a)(7)’s language is identical 
to the portion of section 1028A at issue in Flores-Figueroa, compare 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1028(a)(7), with 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1), prosecutors should be prepared 
to make the evidentiary showing required by that case in section 1028(a)(7) 
prosecutions.

Section 1028(a)(7) also requires a predicate offense, much like section 1028A 
(discussed below). However, the scope of section 1028(a)(7) is much broader 
than that of section 1028A. Section 1028A depends solely on certain enumerated 
federal felonies. See 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). Section 1028(a)(7) charges, on 
the other hand, may be based on any federal violation (felony or misdemeanor) 
or any local or state felony. See 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7). 

3 The cases cited in the preceding paragraphs were all discussing the meaning of “means of 
 
identification” in instances in which the defendant was charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1028A, not section 1028(a)(7). They are nonetheless relevant for purposes of section 1028(a)
(7), as the same definition for “means of identification,” found at 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7), ap-
plies to both offenses.

(A); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1028(c)(3) (identifying other jurisdictional hooks for 
section 1028 violations). Courts have interpreted this jurisdictional provision 
broadly, holding that the government must prove only a “minimal nexus” to 
interstate commerce in order to sustain a conviction. This standard is satisfied 
if  the  government  proves  that  the  defendant  had  the  intent  to  accomplish 
acts  that,  if  successful,  would  have  affected  interstate  or  foreign  commerce; 
however, the government need not prove that the defendant had knowledge of 
the potential effects on interstate commerce when he committed the offense. 
United States v. Klopf, 423 F.3d 1228, 1237-38 (11th Cir. 2005); United States 
v. Pearce, 65 F.3d 22, 25 (4th Cir. 1995); see also United States v. Jackson, 155 
F.3d 942, 946-47 (8th Cir. 1998) (rejecting defendant’s argument that section 
1028 conviction required showing that stolen identification document traveled 
in  interstate  commerce;  jurisdictional  requirement  satisfied  by  showing 
that  “possession  of  the  [document]  was  integral  to  his  scheme  to  defraud 
businesses . . . operating in interstate commerce”); United States v. Berry, 583 
F. Supp. 2d 749 (E.D. Va. 2008) (“[A]ll that is required of a conviction under 
[section 1028] is that the fraudulent use of the social security number occur as 
part of a plan or operation that affected interstate commerce.”). But see United 
States v. Della Rose, 278 F. Supp. 2d 928 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (evidence insufficient 
to support conviction where false identification was used to cash an intrastate 
check at a bank and government presented “no evidence of any out-of-state 
involvement”).

 

2.  Penalties
An offender who violates section 1028(a)(7) is subject to a fine and up to 
15 years’ imprisonment if, as a result of the crime, he obtains anything of value 
aggregating $1,000 or more during a one-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1028(b)(1)
(D). In most other cases, the maximum term of imprisonment is 5 years. 18 
U.S.C. § 1028(b)(2)(B). However, the court may impose higher sentences if 
the offense facilitates a drug trafficking crime, a crime of violence, or an act of 
terrorism, or if the offender has a previous conviction under this section. 18 
U.S.C. § 1028(b)(3)-(4). 

In  addition,  a  court  may  order  the  offender  to  pay  restitution  to  the 
victims of the identity theft in an amount that is “equal to the value of the 
time reasonably spent by the victim in an attempt to remediate the intended 

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

99

or actual harm” caused by the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(b)(6). This provision, 
added to 18 U.S.C. § 3663 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution 
Act  of  2008,  ensures  that  victims  of  identity  theft  can  be  compensated  for 
the  time  and  expense  associated  with,  among  other  things,  correcting  their 
credit reports or fighting fraudulent charges. Cf. United States v. Havens, 424 
F.3d 535, 539 (7th Cir. 2005) (rejecting, prior to amendment of 18 U.S.C. 
§  3663, argument that identity theft victim was entitled to reimbursement for 
time spent clearing her credit because it would take the restitution statute “too 
far”).

C.  Aggravated Identity Theft: 18 U.S.C. § 1028A
 

1.  Application to Network Crimes
The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, which took effect July 15, 
2004, established a new offense of aggravated identity theft. Section 1028A 
applies  when  a  defendant  “knowingly  transfers,  possesses,  or  uses,  without 
lawful authority, a means of identification of another person” during and in 
relation to any felony violation of certain enumerated federal offenses, including 
18 U.S.C. §§ 1028 (but not 1028(a)(7)), 1029, 1030, 1037, and 1343. See 18 
U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). In other words, section 1028A is often applicable in 
the context of computer crime. For example, “carders,” who sell or trade stolen 
credit or debit card account information on online forums, or “phishers,” who 
obtain the same type of information via fraudulent emails, often violate section 
1029, a predicate crime for a section 1028A charge. Similarly, defendants who 
engage in hacking activity in violation of section 1030 and obtain identity or 
account information often may also violate this section.

“Person,” as used in section 1028A, refers to individuals both living and 
dead, and a defendant violates the statute regardless of whether the individual 
whose  identity  is  stolen  is  alive  or  deceased  at  the  time  of  the  offense.  See 
United States v. Kowal, 527 F.3d 741, 745-77 (8th Cir. 2008); United States 
v.  Jiminez,  507  F.3d  13,  22  (1st  Cir.  2007)  (“[T]he  natural  reading  of  the 
word ‘person’ in the phrase ‘means of identification of another person’ includes 
persons deceased.”); United States v. Maciel-Alcala, 2008 WL 4369299, at *2-
3 (C.D. Cal. 2008); United States v. Shain, 2008 WL 2940641, at *1 (W.D. 
Wash. 2008).

The definition of “means of identification” is found at 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)
(7)  and  encompasses  “any  name  or  number  that  may  be  used,  alone  or  in 

100  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

conjunction  with  any  other  information,  to  identify  a  specific  individual.” 
As  discussed  above  in  the  context  of  section  1028(a)(7),  it  is  not  entirely 
clear whether a non-unique identifier, such as a name, qualifies as a “means 
of identification” when standing alone or whether it must be combined with 
additional information that permits the identification of a specific individual 
(see page 96 above).

After Congress enacted section 1028A, the courts of appeals disagreed about 
whether the government must prove that the defendant knew that the means 
of identification at issue actually belonged to someone else in order to obtain 
a conviction for aggravated identity theft. Compare United States v. Godin, 534 
F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2008) (defendant must know means of identification belongs 
to another person); United States v. Miranda-Lopez, 532 F.3d 1034 (9th Cir. 
2008) (same), and United States v. Villanueva-Sotelo, 515 F.3d 1234 (D.C. Cir. 
2008) (same), with United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, 520 F.3d 912 (8th Cir. 
2008) (knowledge requirement does not apply to “of another person”), United 
States v. Hurtado, 508 F.3d 603 (11th Cir. 2007) (same), and United States v. 
Montejo, 442 F.3d 213 (4th Cir. 2006) (same). The Supreme Court resolved 
the issue in Flores-Figueroa v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 1886 (2009). Flores-
Figueroa, a citizen of Mexico, gave his employer counterfeit social security and 
alien registration cards that displayed his real name and numbers belonging 
to other people. Flores-Figueroa argued that he could not be convicted under 
section  1028A  because  the  government  could  not  prove  that  he  knew  that 
the  numbers  on  the  cards  actually  belonged  to  others;  the  government,  on 
the other hand, argued that it was sufficient to prove that the numbers were 
assigned to other people. Id. at 1889-90. The Court sided with Flores-Figueroa, 
holding that “[section] 1028A(a)(1) requires the [g]overnment to show that the 
defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another 
person.”

 

2.  Penalties
In general, those who violate section 1028A are subject to a mandatory two-
year term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). In cases of terrorism-
related  aggravated  identity  theft,  including  that  related  to  section  1030(a)
(1), section 1028A imposes an additional five-year term of imprisonment. 18 
U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(2). In most cases, the additional terms of imprisonment will 
run consecutively, not concurrently. 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(b). In those instances, 
the statute forbids sentencing judges from reducing the term of imprisonment 
imposed with regard to the predicate crime in order to compensate for the two-

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

101

year consecutive sentence required by section 1028A. 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(b)
(3); see United States v. Guillen-Esquivel, 534 F.3d 817, 818-19 (8th Cir. 2008) 
(reversing  sentence  where  district  court  impermissibly  imposed  a  below-
Guidelines sentence with regard to predicate crime because it thought within-
Guidelines  sentence,  in  conjunction  with  two-year  mandatory  consecutive 
sentence imposed by section 1028A, was “excessive”; section 1028A “required 
the district court to ignore altogether [the two-year consecutive sentence] when 
imposing sentence for the [predicate offense].”). However, the First Circuit has 
held that a district court may permissibly take into account and compensate 
for  section  1028A’s  mandatory  two-year  consecutive  term  of  imprisonment 
when deciding what sentence to impose for non-predicate crimes charged in 
the same indictment. United States v. Vidal-Reyes, 562 F.3d 43, 49-56 (1st Cir. 
2009).

As a result of the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008, 
a court may also order the offender to pay restitution to the victims of the 
identity theft in an amount that is “equal to the value of the time reasonably 
spent by the victim in an attempt to remediate the intended or actual harm” 
caused by the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(b)(6).

Fraud Section of the Department of Justice at (202) 514-7023.

D.  Access Device Fraud: 18 U.S.C. § 1029

Ten  separate  activities  relating  to  access  devices  are  criminalized  in  18 

U.S.C. § 1029. The term “access device” is defined to mean

any card, plate, code, account number, electronic serial number, 
mobile identification number, personal identification number, 
or other telecommunications service, equipment, or instrument 
identifier, or other means of account access that can be used, 
alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain 
money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can 
be  used  to  initiate  a  transfer  of  funds  (other  than  a  transfer 
originated solely by paper instrument).

18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(1). Prosecutors commonly bring charges under section 
1029 in many types of “phishing” cases, where a defendant uses fraudulent 
emails to obtain bank account numbers and passwords, and “carding” cases, 

102  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

where a defendant purchases, sells, or transfers stolen bank account, credit card, 
or debit card information. Penalties for violations of section 1029 range from 
a maximum of 10 or 15 years of imprisonment depending on the subsection 
violated. See 18 U.S.C. § 1029(c)(1)(A). Second and later offenses are subject 
to 20 years of imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. § 1029(c)(1)(B). Forfeiture is also 
available in many cases. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1029(c)(1)(C), (c)(2).

The  definition  of  “access  device”  is  “broad”  and  “open-ended”  in  order 
to ensure that the statute encompasses new access devices made available by 
technological innovation. United States v. Scott, 250 F.3d 550, 552 (7th Cir. 
2001). Nonetheless, the definition does not reach all mechanisms that permit 
the transfer of something of value; rather, the mechanism must also be a “means 
of account access.” For example, in United States v. Lutz, 2008 WL 4449082 
(N.D. Ohio 2008), the defendant utilized a bar code generator to create UPC 
labels  that  he  affixed  to  merchandise  in  Wal-Mart;  these  fraudulent  UPCs 
permitted the defendant to purchase the goods for less than retail price. He 
would then remove the fake UPC from the product and return it to the store, 
obtaining a credit for the full retail value. Id. at *1. The court held that the false 
UPCs  were  not  access  devices,  noting  that  “courts  interpret  [s]ection  1029 
as requiring access to a system that monitors or tracks an ongoing account 
relationship between two parties,” whereas the false UPC codes only served as a 
means of accessing Wal-Mart’s internal ledger that tracked payments made and 
goods sold for inventory purposes. Id. at *3-4. The court reasoned, “[d]efining 
‘account’ to include such a general ledger system would turn [section] 1029 
into a general theft statute applicable whenever a company can document loss 
through fraud.” Id. at *4 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also United 
States v. Bruce, 531 F. Supp. 2d 983 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (reaching same conclusion 
in similar scheme involving fraudulent UPC labels); United States v. Jackson, 
484 F. Supp. 2d 572 (W.D. Tex. 2006) (concluding non-revenue airline tickets, 
which defendant stole and sold to others, did not constitute an “access device” 
because they did not access an account; rather, the information on the tickets 
only accessed the airline’s internal ledger system).

Because  of  these  successful  challenges,  cases  are  stronger  in  which  the 
mechanism at issue permits access to an “identifiable account that exemplifies 
an ongoing relationship” between two parties, Lutz, 2008 WL 4449082, at *5. 
It is worth noting, however, that the device does not necessarily have to access a 
customer account to constitute an “access device.” See, e.g., United States v. Ashe, 
47 F.3d 770 (6th Cir. 1995) (altered cell phones were access devices, despite 

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

103

the fact they did not affect customer accounts, because they accessed accounts 
that cell phone service providers had with each other). 

Section  1029  prohibits  the  production,  use,  possession,  or  trafficking 
of  unauthorized  or  counterfeit  access  devices.  Prosecutors  should  note  the 
difference between “unauthorized” and “counterfeit” devices because certain 
key  sections  of  the  statute  are  based  on  these  two  terms.  “Unauthorized” 
access devices include lost, stolen, or revoked devices, whereas “counterfeit” 
ones include fictitious, altered, or forged devices. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1029(e)(2) & 
(3). Section 1029 also covers activities related to certain tools and instruments 
used to obtain unauthorized use of telecommunications services. See 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 1029(a)(7)-(9). Section 1029 also requires that the government prove that 
the  offense  “affects  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.”  18  U.S.C.  §  1029(a). 
The government need not prove a “substantial” effect on commerce; instead, 
demonstrating  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  had  an  “explicit”  or  “concrete” 
effect is sufficient. See United States v. Wilson, 240 F.3d 39 (D.C. Cir. 2001). It 
is enough, for example, if an out-of-state institution issues the access devices. 
See United States v. Delgado, 124 Fed. Appx. 694, 696 (2d Cir. 2005); United 
States v. Klopf, 423 F.3d 1228, 1240 (11th Cir. 2005) (“credit cards generally 
are issued to applicants by out-of-state financial institutions”); United States 
v. Rushdan, 870 F.2d 1509, 1513 (9th Cir. 1989) (possession of out-of-state 
credit  cards  sufficient  to  satisfy  interstate  commerce  requirement  of  section 
1029).

1037 Summary (Misd.)

E.  CAN-SPAM Act: 18 U.S.C. § 1037
  The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003,
Pub.  L.  No.  108-187,  117  Stat. 
2699 
(2003),  which  became 
effective  on  January  1,  2004, 
provides  a  means  for  prosecuting 
those responsible for sending large 
amounts of unsolicited commercial 
email  (a.k.a.  “spam”).  Although 
civil and regulatory provisions are 
the  Act’s  primary  enforcement 
mechanisms, it also created several 
new criminal offenses at 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1037.  These  offenses  address 
more  egregious  violations  of  the 
CAN-SPAM  Act, 
particularly 
where  the  perpetrator  has  taken 
significant  steps  to  hide  his  or 
her  identity  or  the  source  of  the 
spam from recipients, ISPs, or law 
enforcement agencies. 

Transmission of multiple commercial emails by: 
1.  accessing a protected computer, without 

authorization, to send them

  OR
2.  sending them through a protected computer 

with the intent of hiding their origin

  OR
3.  materially falsifying header information
  OR
4.  falsifying registration information for five 
or more email accounts or two or more 
domain names

  OR
5.  falsely representing oneself as the registrant 

of five or more IP addresses (or conspiring 
to do so)

(Felony)

committed in violation of section 
1037(a)(1)
  OR
committed in violation of section 1037(a)(4), 
and involved 20+ falsely registered email 
accounts or 10+ falsely registered domains
  OR
volume transmitted exceeded 2,500 during 
24 hours, 25,000 during 30 days, or 250,000

  OR
caused an aggregate loss of $5,000 or more to 
one or more persons during one year
  OR
obtained anything of value totaling $5,000 or 
more during one year
  OR
undertook the offense with 3+ persons and 
was an organizer or leader

In addition to section 1037, the 
CAN-SPAM Act contained another 
criminal  provision,  codified  at  15 
U.S.C.  § 7704(d),  that  prohibits 
sending sexually explicit email not 
containing a label or marking it as 
such.  A  knowing  violation  of  this 
section  is  punishable  by  a  fine, 
imprisonment  for  not  more  than 
five  years,  or  both.  For  questions

Title 18, United States Code, Section 1037(a) provides:
Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly—
(1)  accesses  a  protected  computer  without  authorization,  and 
intentionally  initiates  the  transmission  of  multiple  commercial 
electronic mail messages from or through such computer,
(2)  uses  a  protected  computer  to  relay  or  retransmit  multiple 
commercial electronic mail messages, with the intent to deceive or 
mislead recipients, or any Internet access service, as to the origin of 
such messages,
(3) materially falsifies header information in multiple commercial 
electronic mail messages and intentionally initiates the transmission 
of such messages,
(4) registers, using information that materially falsifies the identity 
of the actual registrant, for five or more electronic mail accounts 
or  online  user  accounts  or  two  or  more  domain  names,  and 
intentionally  initiates  the  transmission  of  multiple  commercial 
electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or 
domain names, or
(5) falsely represents oneself to be the registrant or the legitimate 
successor in interest to the registrant of 5 or more Internet Protocol 
addresses, and intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple 
commercial  electronic  mail  messages  from  such  addresses,  or 
conspires to do so, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).

A person violates this section whether they personally perform the prohibited 
act or procure another person to do so. See United States v. Kilbride, 507 F. Supp. 
2d  1051,  1064  (D.  Ariz.  2007)  (defendant  “initiated”  electronic  messages, 
within  the  meaning  of  CAN-SPAM  Act,  when  he  paid  another  individual 
to send said messages; defendant also materially falsified information, within 
the meaning of section 1037, when third party altered header at defendant’s 
instruction). 

 

1.  Commercial Electronic Mail Messages
Section 1037 only criminalizes conduct involving “commercial electronic 

mail messages”:

106  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(A) In general. The term “commercial electronic mail message” 
means  any  electronic  mail  message  the  primary  purpose  of 
which  is  the  commercial  advertisement  or  promotion  of  a 
commercial  product  or  service  (including  content  on  an 
Internet website operated for a commercial purpose). 
term 
(B)  Transactional  or  relationship  messages.  The 
“commercial  electronic  mail  message”  does  not  include  a 
transactional or relationship message.

15 U.S.C. § 7702(2). While the most common type of “electronic mail message” 
is email, other types of communication, such as messages sent between users 
of social networking sites, may also qualify. See MySpace, Inc. v. Wallace, 498 
F. Supp. 2d 1293 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (messages sent by MySpace user to other 
users are “electronic mail messages” within scope of CAN-SPAM Act). 

 

2.  Materially Falsified
Sections 1037(a)(3) and (a)(4) require proof that certain information was 

“materially” falsified: 

For purposes of paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a), header 
information or registration information is materially falsified if 
it is altered or concealed in a manner that would impair the 
ability of a recipient of the message, an Internet access service 
processing  the  message  on  behalf  of  a  recipient,  a  person 
alleging a violation of this section, or a law enforcement agency 
to  identify,  locate,  or  respond  to  a  person  who  initiated  the 
electronic mail message or to investigate the alleged violation.

18 U.S.C. § 1037(d)(2). One court has rejected a technical approach to this 
portion of the CAN-SPAM Act that would create liability for an inaccuracy 
in the header information where the sum total of the information provided in 
the message makes clear who sent the message and how they can be located 
and  contacted.  See  Omega  World  Travel,  Inc.  v.  Mummagraphics,  Inc.,  469 
F.3d 348 (4th Cir. 2006) (commercial emails that contained nonfunctioning 
“from” email address and inaccurate information regarding server from which 
email originated were not materially false or misleading; emails contained link 
through  which  recipient  could  unsubscribe  from  future  messages,  provided 
valid address and phone number for sender, and accurately identified name 
and domain name of sender); but see Aitken v. Comm’n Workers of America, 496 

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

107

F. Supp. 2d 653, 667 (E.D. Va. 2007) (accepting that “appropriate caution” 
should be used “in finding technical inaccuracies to be materially misleading,” 
but concluding that inaccurate “from” email address could be material when it 
“may have affected an objective recipient’s opinion of the value” of the contents 
of the message).

A court has also rejected a defense argument that registration and header 
information was not materially falsified if the information, while accurate, leads 
back to a third party intermediary. In United States v. Kilbride, 507 F. Supp. 2d 
1051 (D. Ariz. 2007), the court concluded that the third party was “a front, 
a shill, and [the defendant] intentionally designed the header information to 
impair the ability of recipients and others to identify [him].” Id. at 1065; see 
also id. at 1067 (“To the extent Defendants now attempt to . . . claim that [the 
third party] was the actual registrant, their own fraudulent structure defeats 
their argument. . . . In truth, the persons who created, registered, used, and 
profited from the domain names were Defendants. They were the men behind 
the curtain, the actual registrants.”).

 

3.  Multiple
Section 1037 only criminalizes conduct involving “multiple” commercial 

email messages:

The  term  “multiple”  means  more  than  100  electronic  mail 
messages during a 24-hour period, more than 1,000 electronic 
mail messages during a 30-day period, or more than 10,000 
electronic mail messages during a one-year period.

18 U.S.C. § 1037(d)(3).

 

4.  Penalties
The penalty for a violation of section 1037 depends on aggravating factors 
and  prior  convictions.  If  committed  in  furtherance  of  any  federal  or  state 
felony, or where the defendant has a prior conviction under section 1037 or 
1030 or a similar state law, the maximum prison time is five years. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1037(b)(1). The maximum prison time is three years if:

•	
•	

committed	in	violation	of	section	1037(a)(1);
committed	in	violation	of	section	1037(a)(4),	and	it	involved	20	or	
more falsely registered email accounts or 10 or more falsely registered 
domains;

18 U.S.C. § 1037(b)(2)(A)-(F).

 All other violations of section 1037 are misdemeanors, punishable by a fine, 

imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 18 U.S.C. § 1037(b)(3).

Section 1037 also allows for the criminal forfeiture of equipment used to 
facilitate the offense, as well as any proceeds gained from the commission of the 
offense. 18 U.S.C. § 1037(c). For more information about forfeitures, please

Division of the Department of Justice at (202) 514-1263.

F.  Wire Fraud: 18 U.S.C. § 1343

One  particularly  powerful  and  commonly  applicable  charge  in  network 
crime  cases  is  wire  fraud,  18  U.S.C.  § 1343.  The  United  States  Attorneys’ 
Manual provides extensive guidance regarding wire fraud charges, see USAM 
9-43.000, as does the manual Identity Theft and Social Security Fraud (Office of 
Legal Education 2004).

Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343 provides: 

Whoever,  having  devised  or  intending  to  devise  any  scheme  or 
artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of 
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits, 
or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television 
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, 
signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such 
scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not 
more than 20 years, or both. If the violation affects a financial 

3. Other Network Crime Statutes 

109

institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 
or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.

 

1.  Application to network crimes
Courts have recognized a variety of means of communications, including 
facsimile,  telex,  modem,  and  Internet  transmissions,  as  constituting  “wire, 
radio,  or  television  communication[s].”  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Selby,  557 
F.3d 968, 978-79 (9th Cir. 2009) (defendant’s act of sending a single email was 
“sufficient to establish the element of the use of the wires in furtherance of the 
scheme”); United States v. Drummond, 255 Fed. Appx. 60, 64 (6th Cir. 2007) 
(affirming wire fraud conviction where defendant made airline reservation with 
stolen credit card over the Internet); United States v. Pirello, 255 F.3d 728 (9th 
Cir. 2001) (affirming sentence of defendant who used the Internet to commit 
wire fraud).

Sections 1343 and 1030(a)(4) overlap to a substantial degree; both require 
fraudulent intent. Section 1343, however, carries significantly higher penalties. 
Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (20 years imprisonment; 30 years of imprisonment 
for fraud affecting financial institutions) with 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(3) (5 years 
of  imprisonment  for  initial  section 1030(a)(4)  violation;  10  years  for  later 
violations). Section 1343 is also a predicate for RICO and money laundering 
charges, whereas section 1030 is not (with the exception of terrorism-related 
violations of section 1030(a)(1) and 1030(a)(5)(A)). For the full list of RICO 
predicate offenses, see 18 U.S.C. § 1961.

 

2.  Penalties
Violations of this section are felonies, punishable by a fine, imprisonment 
for not more than 20 years, or both. 18 U.S.C. § 1343. If the violation affects a 
financial institution, the maximum penalty rises to a fine of up to $1,000,000, 
imprisonment for not more than 30 years, or both. Id.

G.  Communication Interference: 18 U.S.C. § 1362

Where a compromised computer is owned or used by the United States for 
communications purposes, 18 U.S.C. § 1362 may provide an alternative or 
additional charge. 

110  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

Title 18, United States Code, Section 1362 provides:

Whoever  willfully  or  maliciously  injures  or  destroys  any  of  the 
works, property, or material of any radio, telegraph, telephone or 
cable, line, station, or system, or other means of communication, 
operated or controlled by the United States, or used or intended to 
be used for military or civil defense functions of the United States, 
whether constructed or in process of construction, or willfully or 
maliciously interferes in any way with the working or use of any 
such line, or system, or willfully or maliciously obstructs, hinders, 
or  delays  the  transmission  of  any  communication  over  any  such 
line, or system, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be 
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or 
both.

1.  Application to Network Crimes

Section 1362 applies to “any of the works, property, or material of any 
radio, telegraph, telephone or cable, line, station, or system, or other means 
of communication, operated or controlled by the United States, or used or 
intended to be used for military or civil defense functions of the United States.” 
18 U.S.C. § 1362. The statute’s scope is broad and includes privately owned 
lines and systems, even those that are not exclusively devoted to military or civil 
defense functions. See United States v. Turpin, 65 F.3d 1207 (4th Cir. 1995) 
(internal communications line used by private railroad was “used for a military 
function”  because  railroad  was  sometimes  used  to  ship  materials  to  defense 
contractors). The list of covered communications systems could include, for 
example, those belonging to Internet Service Providers and that, in part, carry 
government communications.

Because section 1362 carries a ten year minimum, it may be an appropriate 
charge in cases involving a significant intrusion into a U.S. government system 
that  would  otherwise  only  qualify  for  a  misdemeanor  charge  under  section 
1030 (e.g., first time violations of section 1030(a)(2)(B), (a)(3), (a)(5)(C), or 
(a)(6)(B)).

 

2.  Penalties
A violation of this section is a felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment 

for not more than 10 years, or both. 18 U.S.C. § 1362.

Special Considerations

Jurisdiction

A. 
 

1.  Interstate Commerce or Communication Requirement
Several  of  the  statutes  discussed  in  this  manual  require  an  interstate  or 
foreign jurisdictional hook. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a) (prohibiting access 
device fraud “if the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce”); 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2510(12)  (defining  “electronic  communication”  to  mean  any  “transfer  of 
signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence . . . that affects 
interstate or foreign commerce”). Failure to establish the “interstate” basis for 
federal jurisdiction can lead to dismissal or acquittal. See United States v. Jones, 
580 F.2d 219 (6th Cir. 1978) (affirming judgment of acquittal in wiretap case 
where government failed to offer evidence that telephone company provided 
facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications).

In the context of computer crime, the inexorable connection between the 
Internet and interstate commerce may sometimes be sufficient to satisfy the 
jurisdictional element of the statute at issue. For example, many of the charges 
in 18 U.S.C. § 1030 prohibit unlawful access of a “protected computer,” which 
includes a computer used in or affecting “interstate or foreign commerce or 
communication.”  18  U.S.C.  § 1030(e)(2)(B).  In  most  cases,  demonstrating 
that a computer was connected to the Internet will satisfy this requirement. 
See, e.g., United States v. Trotter, 478 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir. 2007) (“[The 
defendant]’s admissions demonstrate that the Salvation Army’s computers fall 
within the statutory definition of a ‘protected computer.’ Trotter admitted the 
computers were connected to the Internet.”); NCMIC Finance Corp. v. Artino, 
638 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1060 (S.D. Iowa 2009) (concluding computers qualified 
as protected computers because they were connected to Internet); Continental 
Group, Inc. v. KW Property Management, LLC, 622 F. Supp. 2d 1357, 1370 
(S.D. Fla. 2009) (“A connection to the internet is ‘affecting interstate commerce 
or communication.’”).

113

Similarly, several courts have indicated a willingness to assume that a crime 
took place “in or affecting interstate commerce” as long as there is evidence 
that  the  defendant  used  the  Internet  in  connection  with  the  offense.  For 
example, in United States v. Fumo, 2009 WL 1688482 (E.D. Pa. 2009), the 
Court rejected the argument that a wire fraud conviction required evidence 
that certain emails actually crossed state lines. The court concluded, “[I]t is 
legally sufficient for purposes of the ‘interstate commerce’ requirement that 
the  emails  at  issue  were  sent  and  received  through  the  Internet.”  Id.  at  *9. 
See also United States v. Sutcliffe, 505 F.3d 944, 952 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting, 
in  context  of  prosecution  under  section  1028,  that  “it  seems  clear  that  use 
of  the  internet  is  intimately  related  to  interstate  commerce”);  United  States 
v. Horne, 474 F.3d 1004, 1006 (7th Cir. 2007) (because defendant utilized 
Internet to locate and arrange meetings with victims, which he would then rob, 
government needed to show no further nexus to interstate commerce to sustain 
Hobbs Act conviction); United States v. MacEwan, 445 F.3d 237, 244 (3d Cir. 
2006) (“Regardless of the route taken, however, we conclude that because of 
the very interstate nature of the Internet . . . the data has traveled in interstate 
commerce. Here, once the images of child pornography left the website server 
and entered the complex global data transmission system that is the Internet, 
the  images  were  being  transmitted  in  interstate  commerce.”);  United  States 
v.  Carroll,  105  F.3d  740,  742  (1st  Cir.  1997)  (holding,  in  context  of  child 
pornography  prosecution,  that  “[t]ransmission  of  photographs  by  means  of 
the Internet is tantamount to moving photographs across state lines and thus 
constitutes transportation in interstate commerce”); United States v. Runyan, 
290 F.3d 223, 239 (5th Cir. 2002) (citing Carroll).

In child pornography case, the Tenth Circuit “decline[d] to assume that 
Internet use automatically equates with a movement across state lines”; instead, 
“the government must introduce evidence to satisfy its burden of proof” with 
regard to interstate movement. United States v. Schaefer, 501 F.3d 1197, 1205 
(10th  Cir.  2007).  However,  Schaefer  was  a  child  pornography  case.  After 
Schaefer,  Congress  amended  18  U.S.C.  §  2252A  to  alter  the  scope  of  the 
conduct covered to “in or affecting interstate commerce,” rather than just “in 
interstate commerce.” Pub. L. No. 110-358, 122 Stat. 401 (Oct. 8, 2008). 
Congress amended section 1030’s definition of “protected computer” in the 
same way two weeks prior to that. Pub. L. No. 110-326, 122 Stat. 3560 (Sept. 
26, 2008); see also United States v. Mellies, 329 Fed. Appx. 592, 605 (6th Cir. 
2009) (collecting cases disagreeing with Schaeffer). However, it is possible that 
prosecutors could encounter like-minded judges when trying computer crime 

114  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

cases.  Useful  evidence  for  prosecutors  required  to  prove  an  interstate  nexus 
might include testimony as to the geographic location of relevant computer 
servers in relation to the offender. See, e.g., United States v. Szymuszkiewicz, 
2009 WL 1873657, at *2 n.2 (E.D. Wis. 2009) (noting that evidence of out-of-
state server through which email was sent “established a sufficient connection 
to interstate commerce”), aff’d, 2010 WL 3503506 (7th Cir. 2010). Moreover, 
even a “local” provider may utilize communication facilities in another state.

 

2.  Extraterritoriality
Absent  evidence  of  a  contrary  intent,  the  laws  of  the  United  States  are 
presumed not to have extraterritorial application. See United States v. Cotten, 471 
F.2d 744, 750 (9th Cir. 1973). The prosecution may overcome this presumption 
against extraterritoriality by showing “clear evidence of congressional intent to 
apply a statute beyond our borders.” United States v. Gatlin, 216 F.3d 207, 211 
(2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted). “Congress has the authority to 
enforce its laws beyond the territorial boundaries of the United States. Whether 
Congress has in fact exercised that authority in [a particular case] is a matter 
of statutory construction.” Equal Employment Opportunity Comm. v. Arabian 
American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991) (internal citations omitted).

In  2001,  as  part  of  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act,  Congress  revised  sections 
1029 and 1030 to provide explicitly for extraterritorial jurisdiction in certain 
cases. The USA PATRIOT Act added the following language to section 1029:

(h)  Any  person  who,  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United 
States,  engages  in  any  act  that,  if  committed  within  the 
jurisdiction of the United States, would constitute an offense 
under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall be subject to 
the fines, penalties, imprisonment, and forfeiture provided in 
this title if—

(1) the offense involves an access device issued, owned, 
managed,  or  controlled  by  a  financial  institution, 
account  issuer,  credit  card  system  member,  or  other 
entity within the jurisdiction of the United States; and
(2) the person transports, delivers, conveys, transfers to 
or through, or otherwise stores, secrets, or holds within 
the jurisdiction of the United States, any article used to 

4. Special Considerations 

115

assist in the commission of the offense or the proceeds 
of such offense or property derived therefrom.

18 U.S.C. § 1029(h).

The  Act  also  amended  section  1030(e)(2)(B)  to  specifically  include  a 
computer that “is used in interstate or foreign commerce, including a computer 
located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate 
or  foreign  commerce  or  communication  of  the  United  States.”  18  U.S.C. 
§ 1030(e)(2)(B). Even prior to the 2001 amendment, however, at least one 
court held that the plain language of 18 U.S.C. § 1030 was a clear manifestation 
of congressional intent to apply that section extraterritorially. See United States 
v. Ivanov, 175 F. Supp. 2d 367, 374-75 (D. Conn. 2001). 

Extraterritorial 

jurisdiction  may  exist  not  only  based  on  specific 
Congressional intent, but also based on intended and actual detrimental effects 
within the United States. “The intent to cause effects within the United States . . .  
makes it reasonable to apply to persons outside United States territory a statute 
which is not extraterritorial in scope.” United States v. Muench, 694 F.2d 28, 
33 (2d Cir. 1982). “It has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a 
person may be charged in the place where the evil results, though he is beyond 
the jurisdiction when he starts the train of events of which that evil is the fruit.” 
United States v. Steinberg, 62 F.2d 77, 78 (2d Cir. 1932).

Other sources of extraterritorial jurisdiction may include 18 U.S.C. § 7, 
which defines the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States, and 18 U.S.C. §§ 3261-3267, which govern criminal offenses committed 
outside of the United States by members of the military and persons employed 
by or accompanying them.

B.  Venue
 

1.  Background
A  combination  of  constitutional  provisions,  statutes,  and  rules  govern 
venue. See 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure § 301 (3d ed. 
2000).  The  Constitution  mandates  that  the  defendant  be  tried  in  the  state 
and district where the crime was committed. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 
3; U.S. Const. amend. VI. This principle is implemented by Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 18, which states in full: “Unless a statute or these rules 
permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where 

116  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

the offense was committed. The court must set the place of trial within the 
district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses, 
and the prompt administration of justice.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 18. However, the 
Constitution and Rule 18 still leave questions unanswered in many network 
crime cases, such as how to define where an offense has been “committed” or 
how to deal with crimes committed in multiple states or countries. 

Note that when a defendant is charged with more than one count, venue 
must be proper with respect to each count. See United States v. Salinas, 373 F.3d 
161, 164 (1st Cir. 2004) (“The criminal law does not recognize the concept of 
supplemental venue.”). If no single district has proper venue for all potential 
counts, prosecutors can either charge the defendant in multiple districts and 
seek transfer to a single district or bring all charges in one district and seek a 
waiver from the defendant. Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
allows transfer of prosecution for purposes of entering a guilty plea from the 
district where the indictment is pending to the district where the defendant 
is  arrested,  held,  or  present.  Similarly,  Rule  21  allows  a  court  to  transfer  a 
prosecution for trial, upon the defendant’s motion, to another district for the 
convenience of the parties and witnesses. Note, however, that both rules require 
the explicit consent and cooperation of the defendant. A defendant may also 
waive any objections to improper venue, either explicitly or by failing to object 
when the defect in venue is clear. See United States v. Roberts, 308 F.3d 1147, 
1151-52 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v. Novak, 443 F.3d 150, 161 (2d Cir. 
2006).

 

2.  Locations of Network Crimes
Applying  the  principles  of  venue  to  network  crimes  is  not  always  a 
straightforward  endeavor.  As  described  above,  the  central  inquiry  in  venue 
analysis is determining where the crime was committed. Yet, “in today’s wired 
world of telecommunication and technology, it is often difficult to determine 
exactly where a crime was committed, since different elements may be widely 
scattered in both time and space, and those elements may not coincide with 
the accused’s actual presence.” United States v. Saavedra, 223 F.3d 85, 86 (2d 
Cir. 2000); see United States v. Rowe, 414 F.3d 271 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding 
venue in district where agent connected to Internet, entered chat room, and 
saw defendant’s posting in child porn case); United States v. Allamon, 2005 
WL 2542905 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (finding venue in district where victims viewed 
website used in fraudulent scheme).

4. Special Considerations 

117

None of the intrusion crimes discussed in Chapter 1 contains a specific 
venue provisions. Moreover, few reported cases address venue for these crimes. 
See, e.g., United States v. Ryan, 894 F.2d 355 (10th Cir. 2000) (noting that 
18 U.S.C. § 1029 does not specify venue); Berger v. King World Productions, 
Inc., 732 F. Supp. 766 (E.D. Mich. 1990) (examining venue under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1391(b) in a civil suit arising pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2511). 

Multidistrict offenses “may be . . . prosecuted in any district in which such 
offense  was  begun,  continued,  or  completed.”  18  U.S.C.  §  3237(a).  Note 
that only the “essential conduct elements” of a crime qualify. United States v. 
Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 280 (1999). For instance, section 1030(a)
(2)(C)  prohibits  intentionally  accessing  a  computer  without  or  in  excess  of 
authorization, and thereby obtaining information from any protected computer. 
The two essential conduct elements in section 1030(a)(2)(C) are “accessing” 
a computer and “obtaining” information. Thus, it would seem logical that a 
crime under section 1030(a)(2)(C) is committed where the offender initiates 
access and where the information is obtained.

The exact location of each event—the “accessing” and the “obtaining”—

may not always be easily determined. 

Example: An intruder located in California uses communications 
that  pass  through  a  router  in  Arizona  to  break  into  a  network 
in  Illinois  and  then  uses  those  network  connections  to  obtain 
information from a server in Kentucky.

The  intruder  initiated  access  in  California,  and  the  router  in  Arizona 
enabled that access. Arguably, however, the intruder did not achieve access until 
reaching the network in Illinois. Of course, one could also argue that access 
did  not  occur  until  the  intruder  reached  the  server  in  Kentucky  where  the 
information was located. Likewise, one could argue that the intruder obtained 
the information in Kentucky, or that he did not obtain the information until it 
reached him in the district where he was located, in this case, California. 

This  example  illustrates  an  offense  governed  by  18  U.S.C.  § 3237(a). 
Under any of the options discussed above, the appropriate venue would seem 
to include both of the endpoints—that is, the district in which the offender 
is  located  (California)  and  the  district  in  which  the  information  is  located 
(Kentucky).  It  is  likely  that  venue  is  also  proper  at  some,  if  not  all,  of  the 
points in between, since venue may lie “in any district in which [a continuing] 
offense was begun, continued, or completed.” 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a). Under this 

118  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

section, the “accessing” and “obtaining” arguably continued in Arizona and 
Illinois. Certainly, venue seems proper in Illinois where the intruder broke into 
the network. Whether the intruder committed a crime in Arizona is less clear.
Prosecutors looking to fix venue in the locale through which communications 
passed, as in the case of the router in Arizona, should look closely at the facts to 
determine whether venue in that district would satisfy the framework discussed 
above. The case for “pass through” venue may be stronger where transmission 
of the communications themselves constitutes the criminal offense (e.g., when 
a threatening email is sent in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7)) and the 
path of transmission is certain (e.g., when an employee’s email is sent through 
a company mail server in a particular state). See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 
293 Fed. Appx. 826 (2d Cir. 2008) (venue for wire fraud charges appropriate 
in district through which wire transfer related to fraudulent scheme passed, 
even though transfer was not processed in that district); United States v. Offill, 
2009 WL 1649777 (E.D. Va. 2009) (spam emails related to fraudulent scheme 
passed through server located in district cited as one factor in favor of retaining 
venue in that district). By contrast, in cases where the path of transmission 
is unpredictable, a court may find it difficult to conclude that a crime was 
committed in a district merely because packets of information happened to 
travel through that district. Cf. Ashcroft v. ACLU, 535 U.S. 564, 602 (2002) 
(Kennedy, J., concurring) (“In the context of COPA, it seems likely that venue 
would be proper where the material originates or where it is viewed. Whether 
it may be said that a website moves ‘through’ other venues in between is less 
certain.”).  Of  course,  where  the  “pass  through”  computer  itself  is  attacked, 
venue would likely be proper based on the attack, without reference to pass-
through rationale.

Federal prosecutors should also take note of the Department of Justice’s 
policies for wire and mail fraud, which may be analogous. For wire fraud, section 
967 of the Department’s Criminal Resource Manual provides that prosecutions 
“may be instituted in any district in which an interstate or foreign transmission 
was issued or terminated.” Crim. Resource Manual § 967. Although the text of 
section 967 refers only to the place of issuance or termination, the case cited in 
support of that proposition, United States v. Goldberg, 830 F.2d 459, 465 (3d 
Cir. 1987), relies on 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a), which also includes the place where 
the conduct continued, thus leaving open the door to “pass through” venue. 
In  the  case  of  mail  fraud,  section  9-43.300  of  the  U.S.  Attorneys’  Manual 
states that Department of Justice policy “opposes mail fraud venue based solely 

4. Special Considerations 

119

on the mail matter passing through a jurisdiction.” USAM 9-43.300; see also 
Crim. Resource Manual § 966.

In  some  cases,  venue  might  also  lie  in  the  district  where  the  effects  of 
the crime are felt. The Supreme Court has not faced that question directly. 
See United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 279 n.2 (1999) (“The 
Government argues that venue also may permissibly be based upon the effects 
of a defendant’s conduct in a district other than the one in which the defendant 
performs the acts constituting the offense. Because this case only concerns the 
locus delicti, we express no opinion as to whether the Government’s assertion is 
correct.”). However, other courts that have examined the issue have concluded 
that venue may lie “where the effects of the defendant’s conduct are felt, but 
only when Congress has defined the essential conduct elements in terms of 
those  effects.”  United  States  v.  Bowens,  224  F.3d  302,  314  (4th  Cir.  2000), 
cert. denied, 532 U.S. 944 (2001); see also United States v. Krangle, 142 Fed. 
Appx. 504, 505 (2d Cir. 2005) (upholding venue in district where continuing 
offense had “significant effects”). Thus, charges under provisions like 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1030(a)(5) may be brought where the effects are felt because those charges 
are defined in terms of “loss,” even if the bulk of network crimes may not be 
prosecuted in a district simply because the effects of the crime are felt there. 
Prosecutors seeking to establish venue by this method are encouraged to contact 
CCIPS at (202) 514-1026.

C.  Statute of Limitations

For criminal prosecutions, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act subsections 
discussed in Chapter 1 do not contain a specific statute of limitations. Civil 
actions have a two-year statute of limitations. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g) (requiring 
civil actions to be brought “within 2 years of the date of the act complained 
of or the date of the discovery of the damage”); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2707(f) 
(creating two-year statute of limitations for civil actions); 18 U.S.C. § 2520(e) 
(providing that any civil action “may not be commenced later than two years 
after the date upon which the claimant first has a reasonable opportunity to 
discover the violation”).

In  the  absence  of  a  specific  statute  of  limitations,  the  default  federal 
limitations period of five years applies. See 18 U.S.C. § 3282. There are two 
exceptions to this five-year default limit: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(a)(1) and (a)(5)
(A) (if the violation causes the type of damage identified in section 1030(c)(4)

120  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(A)(i)(II)-(IV)). These crimes are included in the list of offenses in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2332b(g)(5)(B) (acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries), which 
offenses  are  incorporated  into  18  U.S.C.  § 3286  (extending  the  statute  of 
limitations for certain terrorism offenses). Section 3286 extends the statute of 
limitations for those crimes to eight years and eliminates it for offenses that 
resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to 
another person. 

For cases involving evidence located in a foreign country, prosecutors can 
request that the court before which an investigative grand jury is impaneled 
suspend the statute of limitations. The court may grant this request if it finds 
by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that an official request has been made 
for such evidence and (2) that it reasonably appears, or reasonably appeared at 
the time the request was made, that such evidence is, or was, in such foreign 
country.  See  18  U.S.C.  § 3292.  Note  that  the  government  may  make  such 
requests ex parte, but must make them before the return of an indictment. In 
addition, a request must bear sufficient indicia of reliability, such as a sworn or 
verified application. See, e.g., United States v. Trainor, 376 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir. 
2004). Courts disagree, however, about whether they may grant an application 
to suspend the statute of limitations if the government makes the request after 
the statute of limitations has expired. Compare United States v. Kozeny, 541 
F.3d  166,  170-71  (2d  Cir.  2008)  (application  must  be  made  before  statute 
of limitations has expired), and United States v. Brody, 621 F. Supp. 2d 1196, 
1201-02 (D. Utah 2009) (same), with United States v. Bischel, 61 F.3d 1429, 
1434-35  (9th  Cir.  1995)  (so  long  as  request  is  made  before  indictment  is 
returned,  court  may  grant  application  filed  after  statute  of  limitations  has 
expired and retroactively suspend statute of limitations), and United States v. 
Hoffecker, 530 F.3d 137, 163 n.4 (3d Cir. 2008) (noting, in dicta, that “there is 
no reason why a case seemingly barred by the statute of limitations cannot be 
revived by a section 3292 application”).

D. 

Juveniles

Federal  prosecutors  can  bring  juvenile  offenders  to  justice,  but  must 
understand  the  applicable  provisions  of  the  criminal  code.  Specifically,  the 
Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 5031-5042, governs 
the criminal prosecution and the delinquent adjudication of minors in federal 
court.

4. Special Considerations 

121

While a complete analysis of the FJDA is beyond the scope of this manual, 
certain  provisions  merit  discussion  because  proceedings  against  juveniles  in 
federal  court  differ  in  significant  respects  from  the  prosecution  of  adults. 
The  FJDA  creates  a  unique  procedure  for  delinquency  proceedings  against 
juveniles—a  process  that  is  quasi-criminal  and  quasi-civil  in  nature,  replete 
with its own procedural complexities and particular rules.

As a threshold matter, note that a juvenile proceedings are not the same 
as criminal prosecutions. Rather, it is a proceeding in which the issue to be 
determined is whether the minor is a “juvenile delinquent” as a matter of status, 
not whether he or she is guilty of committing a crime. Thus, a finding against 
the juvenile does not result in a criminal conviction; instead, it results in a 
finding of “delinquency.” See, e.g., In re Sweeney, 492 F.3d 1189, 1191 (10th 
Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Brian N., 900 F.2d 218, 220 (10th Cir. 
1990)). Indeed, the purpose of the juvenile proceeding is to lessen the amount 
of  stigma  that  attaches  to  the  act  of  delinquency  compared  to  a  criminal 
conviction and to emphasize the rehabilitation, rather than the punishment, of 
the juvenile. See, e.g., United States v. Juvenile Male, 581 F.3d 977, 980-81 (9th 
Cir. 2009); Sweeney, 492 F.3d at 1191; United States v. Hill, 538 F.2d 1072, 
1074 (4th Cir. 1976). With that background in mind, examined below are 
several aspects of the FJDA.

 

1.  Definition of Juvenile
Under  the  FJDA,  a  “juvenile”  is  a  person  who  has  not  yet  reached  the 
age  of  eighteen  at  the  time  of  the  commission  of  the  offense  and  is  under 
twenty-one as of the time of the filing of formal juvenile charges. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 5031.  Thus,  a  person  who  committed  the  offense  before  his  eighteenth 
birthday, but is over twenty-one on the date formal charges are filed, may be 
prosecuted as an adult. The juvenile delinquency proceedings would not apply 
at all in that case. See, e.g., United States v. Blake, 571 F.3d 331, 344-45 (4th 
Cir.  2009)  (explaining  defendant  who  was  over  twenty-one  when  indicted 
for  crime  committed  before  he  turned  eighteen  was  not  a  “juvenile”  under 
the FJDA). This is true even where the government could have charged the 
juvenile prior to his twenty-first birthday, but did not. See In re Jack Glenn 
Martin, 788 F.2d 696, 698 (11th Cir. 1986) (determinative date is date of 
filing of formal indictment or information; fact that government could have 
brought charges against defendant prior to his twenty-first birthday held to 
be  “irrelevant”);  see  also  United  States  v.  Hoo,  825  F.2d  667  (2d  Cir.  1987) 

122  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(holding that absent improper delay by government, age at time of filing of 
formal charges determines whether FJDA applies).

 

2.  Federal Jurisdiction
As  is  true  in  the  case  of  adults,  not  every  criminal  act  committed  by  a 
juvenile  violates  federal  law.  Only  where  Congress  has  determined  that  a 
particular federal interest is at stake, and has passed appropriate legislation, 
can a federal criminal prosecution go forward. In general, under the FJDA, 
there are three situations where federal delinquency jurisdiction over a juvenile 
exists: where the state court lacks jurisdiction or refuses to assume jurisdiction; 
where the state does not have available programs and services adequate for the 
needs of juveniles; or where the crime is a federal felony crime of violence or 
one of several enumerated federal offenses (principally relating to narcotics and 
firearm offenses), and a substantial federal interest exists to warrant exercise of 
federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. § 5032.

 

  No State Statute or State Refuses Jurisdiction
This first basis for federal jurisdiction will be the most frequently used basis 
in the context of juvenile delinquency involving computers. It encompasses 
situations where a state either has no law criminalizing the specific conduct, 
or does have a law but, for whatever reason, indicates that it will not pursue 
proceedings under its law against the minor. With regard to the former, although 
many states have enacted laws analogous to statutes such as the federal network 
crime statute (18 U.S.C. § 1030), the electronic wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. 
§ 2511), and the access device fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1029), some states 
do not have laws under which the acts in question can be prosecuted. In these 
cases, the FJDA nevertheless allows the juvenile to be held accountable for his 
or her act of delinquency under federal law.

More commonly, however, a state will have a statute that does cover the crime 
in question, see, e.g., N.Y. Penal Law § 156.10 (computer trespass); § 156.27 
(computer tampering in the first degree); § 250.05 (intercepting or accessing 
electronic communications), but will be unwilling to assume jurisdiction over 
the juvenile, perhaps because of a shortage of resources or a dearth of technical 
or  prosecutorial  expertise.  In  such  cases,  upon  certification  by  the  United 
States Attorney that pertinent state officials do not wish to proceed against the 
juvenile, the federal court may assume jurisdiction. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032.

4. Special Considerations 

123

In the context of intrusion crimes, certain offenses committed by juveniles 
may amount to crimes in multiple states. A crippling denial of service attack 
or  the  transmission  of  a  computer  virus  can  generate  victims  in  numerous 
jurisdictions. The FJDA, however, does not appear to require the government 
to certify that each state that could potentially assert jurisdiction is unwilling 
to assume that jurisdiction. The FJDA merely requires that the “juvenile court 
or other appropriate court of a State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to 
assume jurisdiction over [the] juvenile.” 18 U.S.C. § 5032 (emphasis added). 
Typically,  the  pertinent  state  will  be  the  state  contemplating  proceedings 
against the minor and which, in practice, will often be the state in which the 
federal prosecutor investigating the case sits. Of course, because federal criminal 
proceedings can often preclude state criminal proceedings under state double 
jeopardy  principles,  federal  prosecutors  faced  with  multistate  cases  should 
consult with prosecutors from all affected states in order to determine what, 
if any, effect a federal juvenile proceeding may have on a state’s proceedings. 
Consultation is also warranted because certain states may provide for treatment 
of the juvenile as an adult more easily than the transfer provisions of the FJDA 
(discussed below).

 

  The State Has No Programs or Inadequate Programs
This second basis for federal jurisdiction arises infrequently, as most states 
do  in  fact  have  programs  and  facilities  that  provide  for  the  adjudication, 
detention,  and  rehabilitation  of  minors.  However,  in  the  event  that  state 
officials were, for any reason, unable to address the needs of a juvenile, this 
exception would apply.

 

Enumerated Crimes and Crimes of Violence

 
The FJDA sets forth certain federal crimes for which jurisdiction is deemed 
to exist because there is a substantial federal interest. The enumerated offenses 
are controlled substance offenses under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 952(a), 953, 955, 
959, and 960(b)(1), (2), or (3), as well as firearms-related offenses under 18 
U.S.C. §§ 922(x), 924(b), (g), or (h). While these offenses typically do not 
apply to computer intrusion cases, the FJDA also permits jurisdiction in cases 
of “crimes of violence” that are punishable as felonies. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032. 
Although  the  FJDA  itself  does  not  define  “crimes  of  violence,”  18  U.S.C. 
§ 16 states that such offenses “ha[ve] as an element the use, attempted use, 
or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.” 
18 U.S.C. § 16. “Crimes of violence” also include any offense “that is a felony 

124  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the 
person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the 
offense.” 18 U.S.C. § 16.

Most  of  the  intrusion  offenses  discussed  in  this  manual  do  not  involve 
physical force. However, several statutes may implicate this basis for jurisdiction 
in  the  context  of  computer-related  crime,  including  18  U.S.C.  § 875(b) 
(transmission  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce  of  extortionate  threats  to 
injure  another  person),  18  U.S.C.  § 1951(a)  and  (b)(2)  (interference  with 
commerce by extortion or threats of physical violence), and 18 U.S.C. § 844(e) 
(transmission of bomb threats).

Prosecutors relying on this third basis for jurisdiction should keep in mind 
that their certification must not only set forth a federal felony crime of violence, 
but must also certify that a substantial federal interest in the case or offense 
justifies federal jurisdiction. Eight of the nine circuits that have addressed the 
issue have held that the United States Attorney’s certification of a substantial 
federal interest is not subject to appellate review for factual accuracy. Only the 
Fourth Circuit has held otherwise. See United States v. John Doe, 226 F.3d 672, 
676-78 (6th Cir. 2000) (collecting cases).

Where  the  federal  government  is  the  victim  of  a  crime,  the  federal 
interest is apparent. Yet, even when the government is not the victim, federal 
interests often exist because network crimes affect critical infrastructures (e.g., 
telecommunications systems) or industries or technologies significant to the 
nation’s economy (e.g., aerospace, computer software), or they are committed 
by  criminals  operating  in  multiple  states  and/or  foreign  countries.  In  these 
important situations, which state and local authorities may be ill-equipped to 
address, federal jurisdiction may be particularly appropriate. 

 

3.  Delinquency Proceedings
Assuming  that  federal  juvenile  jurisdiction  exists,  prosecutors  bringing 
such actions will typically commence the action with the filing, under seal, 
of a juvenile information and the jurisdictional certification. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 5032. It is important to note that the United States Attorney must sign the 
certification personally, and a copy of the pertinent memorandum delegating 
authority from the Assistant Attorney General to the United States Attorney to 
sign the certification should be attached to the submission. See id. (requiring 
certification of the Attorney General).

4. Special Considerations 

125

A juvenile has no Fifth Amendment right to have his or her case presented 
to a grand jury, nor does the juvenile have the right to a trial by jury. See, e.g., 
United States v. Hill, 538 F.2d 1072, 1075-76 (4th Cir. 1976); United States 
v. Indian Boy, 565 F.2d 585, 595 (9th Cir. 1975). Instead, the “guilt” phase 
of a delinquency proceeding is essentially conducted as a bench trial. In that 
trial, the government must prove that the juvenile has committed the act of 
delinquency beyond a reasonable doubt, and the juvenile has many of the same 
rights as a criminal defendant. These include: (1) the right to notice of the 
charges; (2) the right to counsel; (3) the right to confront and cross-examine 
witnesses; and (4) the privilege against self-incrimination. See Hill, 538 F.2d 
at 1075 n.3 (collecting cases). Moreover, in the delinquency proceeding, the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply to the extent that their application 
is not inconsistent with any provision of the FJDA. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(a)(5)
(D); see also 3B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 873 
(3d ed. 2004). The Federal Rules of Evidence likewise apply to the delinquency 
proceeding, see F.R.E. 101, 1101, although courts have held them inapplicable 
to transfer proceedings (discussed below). See Government of the Virgin Islands 
in the Interest of A.M., a Minor, 34 F.3d 153, 160-62 (3d Cir. 1994) (collecting 
cases).

The Act also affords juveniles special protections not ordinarily applicable 
to  adult  defendants.  Most  notably,  it  protects  the  juvenile’s  identity  from 
public  disclosure.  See  18  U.S.C.  § 5038  (provisions  concerning  sealing  and 
safeguarding  of  records  generated  and  maintained  in  juvenile  proceedings). 
Thus, court filings should refer to the juvenile by his or her initials and not by 
name, and investigative agencies should not keep routine booking photographs 
or fingerprints. Moreover, when a juvenile is taken into custody for an alleged 
act of delinquency, the juvenile must be informed of his or her legal rights “in 
language comprehensible to [the] juvenile,” 18 U.S.C. § 5033. In addition, 
the juvenile’s parent, guardian, or custodian must be notified immediately of 
the  juvenile’s  arrest,  the  nature  of  the  charges,  and  the  juvenile’s  rights.  Id. 
Upon arrest, the juvenile may not be detained for longer than a reasonable 
period before being brought before a magistrate. Id. When brought before a 
magistrate, the juvenile must be released to his or her parents or guardian upon 
their promise to bring the juvenile to court for future appearances, unless the 
magistrate determines that the detention of the juvenile is required to secure 
his  or  her  appearance  before  the  court  or  to  ensure  the  juvenile’s  safety  or 
the safety of others. See 18 U.S.C. § 5034. At no time may a juvenile who is 
under twenty-one years of age and charged with an act of delinquency or an 

126  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

adjudicated  delinquent  be  housed  in  a  facility  where  he  or  she  would  have 
regular contact with incarcerated adults. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 5035, 5039. Under 
the FJDA, a juvenile has a right to counsel at all critical stages of the proceeding 
and  the  FJDA  authorizes  the  appointment  of  counsel  where  the  juvenile’s 
parents or guardian cannot afford to retain counsel. See 18 U.S.C. § 5034.

 

4.  Transfers to Adult Criminal Proceedings
As  noted  above,  under  certain  circumstances,  a  juvenile’s  case  may  be 
transferred to adult status, and the juvenile can be tried as an adult. In these 
situations, the case proceeds as any criminal case would, with the exception that 
a juvenile under eighteen who is transferred to adult status may not be housed 
with adults at any time pretrial or post-trial. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 5035, 5039. 
A juvenile may transfer to adult status by waiving his juvenile status, upon 
written request and advice of counsel. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032. In addition, the 
FJDA creates two forms of transfer that do not depend on waiver: discretionary 
transfer and mandatory transfer.

As the name implies, discretionary transfer is an option available, upon 
motion by the government, in certain types of cases in which the juvenile is 
fifteen or older at the time of the commission of the act of delinquency. See 
18 U.S.C. § 5032. Such transfer is available in cases involving felony crimes 
of violence and other enumerated crimes. The government has the burden of 
proving by the preponderance of the evidence that a discretionary transfer is 
in  the  interests  of  justice.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  McQuade  Q.,  403  F.3d 
717,  719  (10th  Cir.  2005).  The  FDJA  identifies  six  factors  that  the  court 
should consider to determine whether to grant a transfer: (1) the age and social 
background of the juvenile; (2) the nature of the alleged offense, including the 
juvenile’s leadership role in a criminal organization; (3) the nature and extent 
of the juvenile’s prior delinquency record; (4) the juvenile’s present intellectual 
development  and  psychological  maturity;  (5)  the  juvenile’s  response  to  past 
treatment  efforts  and  the  nature  of  those  efforts;  and  (6)  the  availability  of 
programs to treat the juvenile’s behavioral problems. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032. In 
the context of typical computer crimes committed by juveniles, several of the 
factors will often counsel in favor of transfer to adult status: many computer 
delinquents come from middle-class or affluent backgrounds; many commit 
their exploits with the assistance of other delinquents; and many are extremely 
intelligent. Moreover, some sophisticated computer criminals are barely under 
the age of eighteen and, as such nearly adult offenders, may merit punishment 
as adults.

4. Special Considerations 

127

Mandatory transfer is much more circumscribed than discretionary transfer 
is. It is limited to certain enumerated offenses (e.g., arson), which typically are 
not  applicable  in  network  crime  prosecutions,  and  violent  felonies  directed 
against other persons. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032. Mandatory transfer is also limited 
to offenses committed by juveniles sixteen or older who have a prior criminal 
conviction  or  juvenile  delinquency  adjudication  for  which  they  could  be 
subject to mandatory or discretionary transfer. As a practical matter, therefore, 
in the area of network crimes, the majority of proceedings begun as juvenile 
proceedings are unlikely to be transferred to adult prosecutions.

Federal  prosecutors  who  are  considering  filing  a  motion  to  transfer  a 
juvenile proceeding to adult criminal court should notify the Gang Unit of the 
Criminal Division at (202) 514-1103. 

 

5.  Sentencing and Detention
Under  the  FJDA,  a  court  has  several  options  in  sentencing  a  juvenile 
adjudged to be delinquent. The court may suspend the finding of delinquency, 
order  restitution,  place  the  juvenile  on  probation,  or  order  the  juvenile’s 
detention.  See  18  U.S.C.  § 5037(a).  In  choosing  what  sentence  to  impose 
on  the  delinquent  juvenile,  district  courts  have  broad  discretion—broader 
than that they enjoy when sentencing an adult. United States v. M.R.M., 513 
F.3d 866, 868 (8th Cir. 2008). However, in cases where detention is ordered, 
such detention can never be longer than the period of detention the juvenile 
would have received had he or she been an adult. See 18 U.S.C. § 5037(b). 
Accordingly, you should consult the Sentencing Guidelines, although they are 
not controlling. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.12; see also United States v. R.L.C., 503 
U.S. 291, 307 n.7 (1992). Finally, if the disposition hearing occurs before a 
juvenile’s eighteenth birthday, the court may commit the juvenile to official 
detention until age twenty-one or for the length of time the juvenile would 
have received as an adult under the Sentencing Guidelines, whichever term is 
less. Juveniles between eighteen and twenty-one at the time of the disposition 
may be detained for a maximum term of three or five years (depending on 
the type of felony relevant to the proceeding), but in no event can they be 
detained longer than the comparable adult sentence under the Guidelines. See 
18 U.S.C. § 5037(b), (c).

 

6.  Other Considerations
As demonstrated above, federal delinquency proceedings are unique from 
a legal point of view, and prosecutors initiating such proceedings would do 

128  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

well to consult closely the provisions of the United States Attorneys’ Manual 
concerning delinquency proceedings, see USAM § 9-8.00, as well as the Gang 
Unit, which serves as the Department’s expert in this field. Prosecutors should 
also familiarize themselves with the legal issues typically litigated in this area in 
order to avoid common pitfalls. See, e.g., Jean M. Radler, Annotation, Treatment 
Under Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 5031-5042) of Juvenile 
Alleged to Have Violated Law of United States, 137 A.L.R. Fed. 481 (1997).

In  addition  to  the  novel  nature  of  the  proceedings  themselves,  crimes 
committed  by  juveniles  pose  unique  investigative  challenges.  For  example, 
common investigative techniques such as undercover operations and the use 
of cooperators and informants can raise difficult issues rarely present in the 
investigation of adults. Indeed, a seemingly routine post-arrest interview may 
raise special issues of consent and voluntariness when the arrestee is a juvenile. 
Compare United States v. John Doe, 226 F.3d 672 (6th Cir. 2000) (affirming 
district court’s refusal to suppress juvenile’s confession notwithstanding arresting 
officer’s failure to comply with parental notification provisions of FJDA, where 
circumstances  surrounding  the  confession  demonstrated  voluntariness  of 
juvenile’s  confession),  with  United  States  v.  Juvenile  (RRA-A),  229  F.3d  737 
(9th Cir. 2000) (ruling that juvenile’s confession should be suppressed where 
arresting officer’s failure to inform parents may have been a factor in confession, 
notwithstanding juvenile’s request to arresting officers that her parents not be 
contacted and informed of the arrest).

Special considerations also arise in transnational contexts, such as a case in 
which a juvenile in a foreign country uses the Internet to damage a government 
computer  or  an  e-commerce  web  server.  Ordinarily,  treaties  govern  the 
extradition of foreign nationals to the United States. Some extradition treaties 
contain provisions that specifically permit the foreign sovereign to take into 
account the youth of the offender in deciding whether to extradite. See, e.g., 
Convention on Extradition Between the United States and Sweden, 14 U.S.T. 
1845;  T.I.A.S.  5496  (as  supplemented  by  Supplementary  Convention  on 
Extradition, T.I.A.S. 10812). Other treaties are silent on the issue of juveniles. 
How  these  situations  will  unfold  in  the  future  is  unclear.  Prosecutors  who

Chapter 5
Sentencing

This  section  addresses 

the  United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines  
(“Guidelines”)  and  the  specific  offense  characteristics  and  adjustments 
commonly applicable to network crimes. This chapter should be read in light 
of the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), 
which holds that courts must consider the United States Sentencing Guidelines, 
but that the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory.

The Guidelines treat most network crimes as basic economic offenses for 
which  U.S.S.G.  §  2B1.1  determines  an  offender’s  sentence.  This  guideline 
applies to property damage, theft, and fraud. Wiretap violations are sentenced 
under a different Guideline, U.S.S.G. § 2H3.1 and are discussed in Section C.

A.  Base Offense Levels

Table 4 sets forth the applicable offense conduct guideline and base offense 
level for each of the crimes discussed in this manual. When the conviction is 
for an attempted violation of a section 1030 crime, see 18 U.S.C. § 1030(b), 
courts should apply the appropriate guideline for the substantive offense and 
then decrease the offense level by three. See U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(a), (b)(1).

As noted in Table 4, most network crimes will be sentenced under U.S.S.G. 
§ 2B1.1. An offense sentenced under this section is usually assigned a basic 
offense level of six.

131

B.  Adjustments Under Section 2B1.1

After  determining  the  base  offense  level,  prosecutors  must  determine 
whether any specific offense characteristics and adjustments may apply. Several 
relevant specific offense characteristics and adjustments are discussed below.

 

1.  Loss
Under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1), the base offense level is increased based on 

the level of monetary loss the defendant caused according to a loss table:

The  government  bears  the  burden  of  proving  the  amount  of  loss  by  a 
preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Jackson, 155 F.3d 942, 948 
(8th Cir. 1998). Courts are not required to determine precisely the amount 
of  loss  attributable  to  a  defendant.  Rather,  “[t]he  court  need  only  make  a 
reasonable estimate of the loss.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(C); see also Elliott 
v. United States, 332 F.3d 753, 766 (4th Cir. 2003); Jackson, 155 F.3d at 948. 
That  reasonable  estimate  should  take  into  account  available  information, 
including, but not limited to, the following: “[t]he fair market value of the 
property taken [or] copied . . . and revenues generated by similar operations.” 
U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(C)(i), (v). Additionally, effective November 1, 2009, 
the Guidelines permit sentencing courts to estimate losses in cases involving 
proprietary information such as trade secrets by taking into account “the cost 
of developing that information or the reduction in value of that information” 
resulting from the offense. U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(C)(ii). This language 
codifies the practice that some courts had already adopted. See United States v. 
Ameri, 412 F.3d 893 (8th Cir. 2005) (upholding calculation of loss by district 
court  that  took  into  account  the  costs  of  developing  specialty  commercial 
software that had been illegally copied).

132  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

In  estimating  the  loss  resulting  from  a  defendant’s  unlawful  intrusions, 
courts should include the reasonable cost of any harm caused by his criminal 
conduct. Such amounts should include the reasonable value of the property 
taken by defendant (such as the data copied) even if the defendant did not 
deprive  the  owner  of  such  data.  Moreover,  the  Application  Notes  instruct 
the court to use the greater of actual loss or intended loss to determine the 
appropriate  offense  level  increase  for  an  offender.  U.S.S.G.  § 2B1.1,  cmt. 
n.3(A). If there is no reliable means of determining loss, the court should use 
the gain to the defendant instead. U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(B); cf. United 
States v. Chatterji, 46 F.3d 1336, 1340 (4th Cir. 1995) (gain cannot be used 
where there is no loss); United States v. Andersen, 45 F.3d 217, 221-22 (7th Cir. 
1995) (same).

Generally,  “actual  loss”  is  limited  to  “reasonably  foreseeable  pecuniary 
harm that resulted from the offense.” In addition, the definition of “intended 
loss” makes it clear that intended pecuniary harm should be counted even if it 
“would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.”

Beyond  the  general  rules  for  calculating  loss  under  the  Guidelines,  an 
additional comment expands the definition of “actual loss” to include certain 
additional harms, whether or not reasonably foreseeable, in cases brought under 
18 U.S.C. § 1030. U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(A)(v)(III). The commentary to 
the 2008 Guidelines states that for such offenses:

actual  loss  includes  the  following  pecuniary  harm,  regardless 
of whether such pecuniary harm was reasonably foreseeable: any 
reasonable cost to the victim including the cost of responding 
to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring 
the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior 
to  the  offense,  and  any  revenue  lost,  cost  incurred,  or  other 
damages incurred because of interruption of service.

Id. (emphasis added).

Note  that  this  definition  adds  to  the  normal  definition  of  “actual  loss” 
used to calculate sentences under the Guidelines. Accordingly, it is not to be 
used in place of, but rather in addition to, the fair market value of the data 
taken or copied by a defendant. This additional language expands the usual 
definition of “actual loss” for section 1030 offenses by including the value of 
certain pecuniary harms even if not reasonably foreseeable, but does not alter 
the definition of “intended loss.” Id.

5. Sentencing 

133

At  least  one  Circuit  has  also  allowed  costs  reasonably  associated  with 
“preventing further damage resulting from Defendant’s conduct.” United States 
v. Middleton, 231 F.3d 1207, 1213 (9th Cir. 2000). Such costs must not be 
“excessive” and may not be costs that “merely create an improved computer 
system unrelated to preventing further damage.” Id. Given that instructions 
for exploiting known computer network vulnerabilities are easily shared via the 
Internet, the cost incurred by a victim to prevent attacks of those who might 
follow the defendant may be allowable as well.

With  the  exception  of  certain  felony  violations  of  18  U.S.C.  § 1030(a)
(5), which may be proved by showing losses exceeding $5,000, and civil suits 
brought  under  18  U.S.C.  § 1030(g),  loss  is  not  an  element  of  any  offense 
under section 1030. While little published case law exists on the subject of 
calculating loss for sentencing purposes under section 1030(a)(5), a number 
of  cases  address  the  issue  of  loss  in  civil  suits  authorized  under  18  U.S.C. 
§ 1030(g). Section 1030(g) requires that civil plaintiffs prove one of the factors 
in  1030(c)(4)(A)(i)—typically  loss  of  more  than  $5,000—before  they  can 
prevail. (“Loss” is discussed in detail beginning on page 41).

There are parallels between the language in the Guidelines commentary for 
loss in section 1030 cases and the definition of loss that is required to prove 
a felony violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5) and, therefore,  to support 
a civil claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g). Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11) 
with  U.S.S.G.  § 2B1.1,  cmt.  n.3(A)(v)(III).  Section  1030(e)(11)  begins  the 
definition  of  “loss”  by  stating  that  loss  “means  any  reasonable  cost  to  any 
victim.”  It  then  provides  a  nonexclusive  list  of  costs  that  may  be  included 
within the definition of “loss” such as:

the  cost  of  responding  to  an  offense,  conducting  a  damage 
assessment,  and  restoring  the  data,  program,  system,  or 
information  to  its  condition  prior  to  the  offense,  and  any 
revenue  lost,  cost  incurred,  or  other  consequential  damages 
incurred because of interruption of service . . . .

18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11). This list is substantially similar to the list in 
the Guidelines commentary for § 2B1.1. See U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. 
n.3(A)(v)(III).

Unlike the definition in the Guidelines that serves to expand the definition 
of actual loss, for civil cases brought under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g) loss is limited 
to the definition set forth in section 1030(e)(11). In that context, a number of 

134  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

courts have held that revenue lost because a computer system was down due to 
an intrusion would be “loss,” but revenue lost to competitors who used customer 
data stolen from the victim would not. See Civic Ctr. Motors, Ltd. v. Mason St. 
Imp.  Cars,  Ltd.,  387  F.  Supp.  2d  378,  381  (S.D.N.Y.  2005)  (“revenue  lost 
because a defendant used unlawfully gained information to unfairly compete 
was not a type of ‘loss’ contemplated under the CFAA”) (citing Nexans Wires 
S.A. v. Sark-USA, Inc., 319 F. Supp. 2d 468, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)). According 
to this line of civil cases, lost revenue (e.g., from lost goodwill or lost business 
opportunities) would only be “loss” under the 1030(e)(11) “if it resulted from 
the impairment or unavailability of data or systems.” Nexans, 319 F. Supp. 2d 
468, 477 (quoting Register.com, Inc., v. Verio, 126 F. Supp. 2d 238, 252 n.12 
(S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff’d, 356 F.3d 393 (2d Cir. 2004)).

Although the concept of loss may be constrained in civil cases brought under 
section 1030(g)—or when establishing a felony under section 1030(a)(5)—
prosecutors  should  be  prepared  to  explain  that  courts  are  not  similarly 
constrained when calculating loss at the time of sentencing for section 1030 
offenses. In such cases, the loss that stems from the intrusion is merely one 
type of loss to be tallied. For example, the fair market value of the data copied 
unlawfully by a defendant is clearly a proper category of loss to be attributed 
to him at sentencing, regardless of whether or not that value could have been 
used to satisfy the loss requirement for a section 1030(a)(5) felony. U.S.S.G. § 
2B1.1, cmt. n.3(C)(i).

Where a network offense includes use of a victim’s services without or in 
excess of authorization, loss may include the cost to the victim of providing 
such services. See, e.g., America Online, Inc. v. National Health Care Discount, 
Inc., 174 F. Supp. 2d 890, 900-02 (N.D. Iowa 2001) (awarding AOL $0.78 
per thousand pieces of electronic mail that a spammer caused to be delivered 
in violation of AOL’s use policy). Loss does not include, however, expenses 
incurred  cooperating  with  law  enforcement’s  investigation  of  the  offense. 
U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(D)(ii); United States v. Sablan, 92 F.3d 865, 870 
(9th Cir. 1996) (excluding “expenses incurred due to meetings with the FBI” 
from loss calculation for purposes of restitution).

Finally,  section  2B1.1  offers  special  instructions  for  determining  loss  in 
cases  involving  “unauthorized  access  devices.”  Section  2B1.1  adopts  the 
definitions used in 18 U.S.C. § 1029 for the terms “counterfeit access device” 
and  “unauthorized  access  device.”  See  U.S.S.G.  § 2B1.1,  cmt.  n.3(F)(i), 
n.9(A).  The  statute’s  broad  definition  includes  any  code,  account  number, 

5. Sentencing 

135

password, personal identification number, or other means of account access 
that has been stolen, forged, or obtained with intent to defraud. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1029(e)(1)-(3); United States v. Petersen, 98 F.3d 502, 505 (9th Cir. 1996) 
(treating computer passwords as access devices). Where a defendant obtains 
access devices without authorization, such as by stealing a password file or by 
Internet credit card phishing, “loss includes any unauthorized charges made 
with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall not 
be less than $500 per access device.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(F)(i).

In a credit card phishing case in which the defendant charged $45,000 
worth of purchases to fraudulently-obtained credit card numbers, possessed an 
additional 250 credit card numbers that he had not used, and also possessed 
150 email account passwords, the loss would be equal to the sum of the charges 
($45,000), $500 for each unused credit card number (250 x $500 = $125,000), 
and $500 for each password (150 x $500 = $75,000), resulting in a total loss 
of $245,000 and an offense level increase of 12 ($500 per access device is the 
minimum  loss;  if  the  actual  charges  exceed  $500,  the  higher  figure  should 
be used instead). Under certain circumstances, it may even be appropriate to 
determine intended loss by aggregating the credit limits of the access devices: 
“[W]here  a  sentencing  court  has  facts  upon  which  to  base  findings  that 
a defendant was capable of and intended to use the [credit] cards to secure 
amounts at or near their credit limits, aggregating the credit limits of the cards 
to calculate loss is appropriate.” See United States v. Say, 923 F. Supp. 611, 614 
(D. Vt. 1995) (citing United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425 (1st Cir. 1995); 
United States v. Sowels, 998 F.2d 249 (5th Cir. 1993)).

 

2.  Number of Victims
Section 2B1.1 imposes a graduated increase in offense level based on the 
number of victims that suffered actual loss as a result of the offense. See U.S.S.G. 
§ 2B1.1(b)(2), cmt. n.1. If the offense causes loss to ten or more victims, the 
offense level is increased by two; if it causes loss to fifty or more victims, the 
offense level is increased by four; and if it causes loss to 250 or more victims, 
the offense level is increased by six. This specific offense characteristic may be 
particularly important in network crimes such as the propagation of worms or 
viruses, crimes that, by their very nature, involve a large number of victims. 

Although this specific offense characteristic takes into account only those 
victims that suffered actual loss as a result of the offense, courts have suggested 
that in cases involving a large, unrealized intended loss, an upward departure 

136  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

may  be  appropriate.  See  United  States  v.  Mohammed,  315  F.  Supp.  2d  354 
(S.D.N.Y.  2003).  Similarly,  although  the  specific  offense  characteristic  does 
not take into account victims that have suffered non-monetary harm, it may 
be appropriate for the court to depart upward if there are a large number of 
such victims. See U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.19(A)(ii) (indicating that upward 
departure may be appropriate if “[t]he offense caused or risked substantial non-
monetary harm”). 

Additionally,  the  Guidelines  that  became  effective  November  1,  2009, 
provide a broader definition of victim in cases involving “means of identification.” 
In such cases, victims include those whose “means of identification were used 
unlawfully or without authority” in addition to those suffering actual loss.

 

3.  Extraterritorial Conduct
The  Guidelines  indicate  that  the  sentencing  court  should  increase  the 
base offense level by two levels or, if such an increase does not result in an 
offense level of at least twelve, to twelve if “a substantial part of a fraudulent 
scheme was committed from outside the United States.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)
(9)(B). Although no reported case offers insight into how courts will apply 
this specific offense characteristic to network crimes that cross international 
boundaries, there is a strong argument to be made that, even if an offender is 
physically located within the United States, he is subject to a two-level increase 
provided for in this specific offense characteristic if he avails himself of a foreign 
email account to receive, possess, and distribute messages in furtherance of a 
fraudulent scheme. Similarly, if an intruder avails himself of a computer in 
another country as a tool dump site or a proxy through which he can intrude 
into other computers or launch attacks, his conduct falls within the scope of 
this specific offense characteristic.

The 11th Circuit’s ruling in United States v. Singh, 291 F.3d 756 (11th Cir. 
2002), supports this theory. In Singh, the defendant engaged in an elaborate 
scheme to obtain international long-distance telephone service free of charge for 
sale to third parties. After initiating a long-distance account with an American 
carrier using false information, the defendant would call his Kuwaiti “clients,” 
who would then provide him a number (usually in a third country) to which they 
wished to be connected. The defendant would use the three-way calling feature 
of his phone service to connect the Kuwaiti client. The telephone companies 
were unable to charge the defendant for these international calls (or anything 
else, for that matter) due to the fraudulent account information. Although the 

5. Sentencing 

137

defendant did not originate this scheme outside the United States or personally 
take action outside the United States, and the government did not produce 
any evidence as to the identity or number of his coconspirators in Kuwait, the 
court upheld a sentencing enhancement on the basis that a substantial portion 
of the scheme was committed from outside the United States.

 

4.  Sophisticated Means
Section  2B1.1  advises  sentencing  courts  to  increase  the  offense  level  by 
two levels (or to increase the offense level to 12, if the two-level increase results 
in an offense level lower than 12) if “the offense . . . involved sophisticated 
means.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C). A “sophisticated means” enhancement is 
appropriate if the offense includes “especially complex or especially intricate 
offense  conduct  pertaining  to  the  execution  or  concealment  of  an  offense.” 
U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.8(B). The Application Note provides several examples 
of “sophisticated means,” such as locating offices involved in a telemarketing 
scheme in more than one jurisdiction, or the use of offshore financial accounts. 
Id.; see also United States v. Paradies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1292 (11th Cir. 1996).

There are few reported cases regarding the application of the sophisticated 
means enhancement to a computer crime defendant. See, e.g., United States 
v. Harvey, 413 F.3d 850 (8th Cir. 2005) (defendants’ use of a computer to 
generate  authentic  looking  checks  as  part  of  fraudulent  scheme  upheld  as 
partial basis for sophisticated means enhancement); United States v. Jones, 530 
F.3d 1292, 1305-07 (10th Cir. 2008) (same).

Prosecutors should consider seeking the “sophisticated means” enhancement 
for computer network crimes in which the defendant uses software or technology 
to conceal his identity or geographic location. For example, when a criminal 
uses an online proxy to prevent the victim or investigators from learning his IP 
address, he has employed a means directly analogous to the examples of offshore 
accounts and multiple jurisdictions already identified in the application note. 
Prosecutors contemplating application of this enhancement to computer crime 
are encouraged to contact CCIPS.

 

5.  Trafficking in Access Devices
Section 2B1.1 advises sentencing courts to increase the offense level by two 
levels (or to increase the offense level to 12, if the two-level increase results in 
an offense level lower than 12) if “the offense involved . . . trafficking of any 
unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)

138  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

(10)(B). The definition of “access device” includes computer passwords and 
credit cards. See 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(1); United States v. Peterson, 98 F.3d 502, 
505  (9th  Cir.  1996)  (acknowledging  district  court’s  treatment  of  computer 
passwords as “access devices”); United States v. Caputo, 808 F.2d 963, 966 (2d 
Cir. 1987) (upholding district court finding that restaurant receipts containing 
credit  card  numbers  are  access  devices).  This  specific  offense  characteristic 
may therefore be applicable to computer intrusion cases in which the intruder 
obtained  the  victim’s  password  and  to  online  fraud  cases  in  which  the 
perpetrators obtain the victims’ password, credit card number, or bank account 
information.

 

6.  Risk of Death or Injury
As basic services such as medical treatment, emergency response, public 
transportation,  water  treatment,  and  military  protection  rely  increasingly 
on computer networks for their maintenance and operation, the risk that a 
computer crime might cause death or serious bodily injury increases. Section 
2B1.1 takes this into account, providing a two-level increase (or an increase 
to level 14, if the two-level increase results in an offense level less than 14) 
“[i]f the offense involved . . . the conscious or reckless risk of death or serious 
bodily injury.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(A). To merit this enhancement, the 
government must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
defendant was aware that his conduct created a risk of death or serious bodily 
injury and that he nonetheless consciously or recklessly disregarded that risk. 
See United States v. McCord, Inc., 143 F.3d 1095, 1098 (8th Cir. 1998). Courts 
have  upheld  application  of  this  enhancement  for  a  medical  researcher  who 
falsely reported the efficacy of a course of treatment for skin cancer, causing 
test subjects to forego other forms of treatment (United States v. Snyder, 291 
F.3d  1291,  1295  (11th  Cir.  2002)),  for  a  defense  contractor  who  provided 
helicopter  armor  that  had  not  undergone  ballistics  tests  when  the  contract 
required pretested armor (United States v. Cannon, 41 F.3d 1462, 1467 (11th 
Cir. 1995)), and for an airport security manager who consciously disregarded 
screening and testing requirements for airport security personnel (United States 
v. Saffer, 118 F. Supp. 2d 546, 548-49 (E.D. Pa. 2000)).

 

7.  Private Information1
Section  2B1.1(b)(15)  directs  a  sentencing  court  to  apply  a  two-level 
enhancement to the offense level of any defendant convicted of violating 18 
1 Amendments to the Guidelines that became effective November 1, 2009, disaggregated 
 

5. Sentencing 

139

U.S.C. § 1030 if his offense involved “an intent to obtain personal information, 
or  .  .  .  the  unauthorized  public  dissemination  of  information.”  U.S.S.G. 
2B1.1(b)(15).2 Application Note 13 defines personal information as:

sensitive  or  private  information  involving  an  identifiable 
person (including such information in the possession of a third 
party), including (i) medical records; (ii) wills; (iii) diaries; (iv) 
private correspondence, including email; (v) financial records; 
(vi) photographs of a sensitive or private nature; or (vii) similar 
information.

Although  the  information  obtained  in  many  cases  will  fall  squarely 
within the examples listed in this definition, other cases may require courts 
to extrapolate and determine whether specific information is of a kind that a 
reasonable computer user would consider sensitive or private.

Several aspects of this provision deserve brief discussion. First, the provision 
does  not  require  a  defendant  to  actually  obtain  personal  information—he 
must merely intend to obtain it. So, for instance, a defendant who accessed 
without authorization an email service provider’s mail server but was unable 
to  gain  access  to  subscribers’  emails  would  receive  this  enhancement  where 
the evidence also included an email or a chat session in which the defendant 
indicated that his intent was to obtain subscribers’ emails and mine them for 
sensitive, valuable information. Second, the provision uses the term “obtain,” 
a term that has been used broadly in the online context to include accessing or 
merely observing information. See S. Rep. No. 99-432, at 6-7 (1986), reprinted 
in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2484 (“‘obtaining information’ [for the purposes 
of  18  U.S.C.  § 1030(a)(2)]  includes  mere  observation  of  the  data.  Actual 
asportation,  in  the  sense  of  physically  removing  the  data  from  its  original 

the specific offense characteristic for offenses involving an intent to obtain personal informa-
tion from seemingly unrelated enhancements for intentionally causing damage to computer 
systems and for disrupting critical infrastructures. These enhancements were previously con-
tained in a single provision, now enumerated as § 2B1.1(b)(16), which directed application of 
the “greatest” enhancement, thereby precluding their independent and cumulative application. 
In the 2009 Guidelines, the enhancement for offenses involving an intent to obtain personal 
information has been segregated into a new § 2B1.1(b)(15), and combined with an enhance-
ment for disclosures of personal information.

location or transcribing the data, need not be proved in order to establish a 
violation of this subsection.”).

Additionally,  section  2B1.1(b)(15)  includes  a  two-level  enhancement 
for the public dissemination of personal information. However, because the 
provision only permits application of either—but not both—enhancements, 
it is likely to have limited application: the offender who unlawfully obtains 
personal information is typically the same person who disseminates it.

 

8.  Intentional Damage
Section  2B1.1(b)(16)(A)(ii)  requires  a  sentencing  court  to  increase 
a  defendant’s  offense  level  by  four  levels  if  the  defendant  intentionally 
damages  a  protected  computer  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  § 1030(a)(5)(A). 
This enhancement applies to any conviction under this statutory subsection, 
effectively raising the base offense level for such violations to ten.

Oddly,  this  provision  is  not  cumulative  with  the  enhancements  for 
computers used to operate critical infrastructures, so intentional damage to an 
electrical grid earns the defendant the same four-level increase as intentional 
damage to a home computer.

 

9.  Critical Infrastructures
Section 2B1.1(b)(16) contains a three-tiered approach to computer crimes 
affecting or relating to a “critical infrastructure.” An Application Note defines 
“critical infrastructure” as:

systems and assets vital to national defense, national security, 
economic security, public health or safety, or any combination 
of those matters. A critical infrastructure may be publicly or 
privately  owned.  Examples  of  critical  infrastructures  include 
gas  and  oil  production,  storage,  and  delivery  systems,  water 
supply systems, telecommunications networks, electrical power 
delivery  systems,  financing  and  banking  systems,  emergency 
services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue services), 
transportation systems and services (including highways, mass 
transit, airlines and airports), and government operations that 
provide essential services to the public.

U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, cmt. n.13(A).

5. Sentencing 

141

The first tier directs a court to increase a defendant’s offense level by two 
levels if the offense was a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030 that “involved . . . 
a  computer  system  used  to  maintain  or  operate  a  critical  infrastructure,  or 
used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of 
justice, national defense, or national security.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(16)(A)(i). 
This lowest tier enhancement applies even if the computer in question is not 
damaged or disrupted; mere access to such a computer is sufficient to trigger 
the two-level increase.

The second tier imposes a six-level enhancement (or, if the resulting offense 
level  is  still  less  than  24,  an  increase  to  24)  for  violations  of  section 1030 
that  “caused  a  substantial  disruption  of  a  critical  infrastructure.”  U.S.S.G. 
§ 2B1.1(b)(16)(A)(iii), (b)(16)(B).

The  third  tier  indicates  that  an  upward  departure  (beyond  offense  level 
24) is appropriate if a violation of section 1030 is “so substantial as to have a 
debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, national 
public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, 
cmt. n.19(B) (emphasis added). The Sentencing Commission provides little 
guidance as to what qualifies as a “substantial disruption” or as a “debilitating 
impact.” In defining “debilitating impact,” the Commission added the word 
“national” as a modifier of “security,” “economic security,” and “public health 
or safety,” indicating that with regard to these factors, a local (as opposed to 
national) disruption may not qualify as “debilitating.” 

C.  CAN-SPAM Act

Section 2B1.1 contains a new two-level increase for defendants who are 
convicted  of  violating  the  CAN-SPAM  Act,  18  U.S.C.  § 1037,  and  whose 
offense “involved obtaining electronic mail addresses through improper means.” 
U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(7). The commentary states that the term “improper means” 
includes  “unauthorized  harvesting  of  electronic  mail  addresses  of  users  of  a 
website, proprietary service, or other online public forum.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, 
cmt. n.6. Prosecutors considering use of this enhancement are encouraged to 
contact CCIPS.

In addition, under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A)(ii), a violator of section 1037 
will automatically receive at least a two-level increase for mass-marketing and 
may receive a larger increase based on the number of victims.

142  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

D.  Wiretap Act

Sentences  for  most  violations  of  the  Wiretap  Act  involving  network 
crimes are addressed by Guideline § 2H3.1 (Interception of Communications; 
Eavesdropping; Disclosure of Tax Return Information).3 The base offense level 
is nine. U.S.S.G. § 2H3.1(a)(1). If the purpose of the offense was to obtain 
commercial advantage or economic gain, the offense level increases by three. 
U.S.S.G.  § 2H3.1(b)(1)(B).  If  the  violation  also  constitutes  an  attempt  to 
commit another offense, courts should apply the guideline that would result in 
a greater offense level. U.S.S.G. § 2H3.1(c)(1).

As a result of being grouped differently than most other network crimes, 
violations  of  the  Wiretap  Act  generally  begin  with  a  higher  base  offense 
level.  This  leads  to  an  initial  sentencing  range  at  least  four  months  greater 
than comparable interceptions of stored communications. Compare U.S.S.G. 
§ 2H3.1(a)(1) (base offense level nine corresponding to imprisonment of 4 to 
10 months at Criminal History Category I) with U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(a)(2) (base 
offense level six corresponding to 0 to 6 months imprisonment at Criminal 
History Category I).

However, Wiretap Act violations are not subject to the same specific offense 
characteristics and adjustments available in Guideline § 2B1.1. The absence of 
these potential enhancements to the offense level for, among other things, the 
amount of loss caused by the offense could result in much shorter sentences for 
Wiretap Act violations than for unauthorized access to stored communications.
For instance, a Wiretap Act violation not committed for economic gain 
by a person with no criminal history would result in a sentencing range of 4 
to 10 months. Such a defendant would be in Zone B and thus eligible for a 
sentence of probation (combined with intermittent confinement, community 
confinement, or home detention). See U.S.S.G. § 2H3.1. The amount of loss 
caused by the individual’s interception will not affect the sentence.

In  contrast,  an  intruder  who  illegally  accessed  a  stored  communication 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2701 (rather than intercepting a communication 
contemporaneous  with  its  transmission)  faces  a  sentence  that  is  potentially 
much more severe. Under section 2701, a sentence can be heavily influenced 

 
3 Wiretap Act violations also may fall under Guideline § 2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of 
Copyright or Trademark). As reflected in the Commentary, this provision is intended primarily 
for the interception of copyrighted satellite transmissions.

5. Sentencing 

143

by the amount of damage caused by the intruder’s conduct. For instance, if an 
intruder’s conduct caused more than $1,000,000 in loss, that individual would 
face a minimum sentence of almost three and one-half years. 

E.  Generally-Applicable Adjustments
 

1.  Overview
The sentencing adjustments set forth in Chapter 3 of the Guidelines may 
further alter the base offense level. In particular, if the computer crime involved, 
or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 
may  apply.  It  also  may  be  appropriate  to  adjust  the  defendant’s  sentence 
based on his role in the crime. The defendant may have played an aggravating 
role  (U.S.S.G.  § 3B1.1)  or  a  mitigating  role  (U.S.S.G.  § 3B1.2),  may  have 
used special skill (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3), or may have involved a minor in the 
commission  of  the  crime  (U.S.S.G.  § 3B1.4).  If  the  defendant  has  tried  to 
delete or destroy evidence, or otherwise frustrate law enforcement’s investigation 
of  his  crime,  an  obstruction  adjustment  may  also  be  appropriate  (U.S.S.G. 
§ 3C1.1). On the other hand, if the defendant has been forthcoming about 
his role in committing the offense and has cooperated with law enforcement, 
a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility may be appropriate 
(U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1).

 

2.  Special Skill
Section  3B1.3  of  the  Guidelines  advises  sentencing  courts  to  increase  a 
defendant’s offense level by two “[i]f the defendant . . . used a special skill[] 
in  a  manner  that  significantly  facilitated  the  commission  or  concealment 
of  the  offense.”  Section  3B1.3  cautions,  however,  that  courts  should  not 
impose the enhancement if the factual predicate that justifies a special skill 
enhancement  has  already  been  the  basis  for  a  specific  offense  characteristic 
(such  as  the  “sophisticated  means”  characteristic  under  U.S.S.G.  § 2B1.1). 
However, “so long as the court finds a sufficient independent factual basis for 
both” a sophisticated means enhancement and a special skill enhancement, “it 
may impose both.” United States v. Minneman, 143 F.3d 274, 283 (7th Cir. 
1998); see also United States v. Rice, 52 F.3d 843, 851 (10th Cir. 1995) (noting 
that both enhancements may be applied because “each of these enhancements 
serves a distinct purpose”). 

144  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

The commentary provides some guidance as to what qualifies as a special 

skill:

“Special skill” refers to a skill not possessed by members of the 
general  public  and  usually  requiring  substantial  education, 
training or licensing. Examples would include pilots, lawyers, 
doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.

U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, cmt. n.4. As courts have noted, however, “[a] defendant 
does not need to have formal education or professional stature to have a 
special skill within the meaning of § 3B1.3[;] a special skill can be derived 
from experience or from self-tutelage.” United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 
F.3d 12, 58 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 500 
(1st Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Urban, 140 F.3d 229, 236 (1st Cir. 
1998) (“[A] § 3B1.3 sentence enhancement is not limited to persons who 
have received substantial formal education, training from experts, or who 
have been licensed to perform a special skill.”).

The  inquiry  regarding  whether  a  particular  skill  constitutes  a  “special 
skill” for the purposes of section 3B1.3 is intensely fact specific. The metric of 
comparison by which it is determined whether a skill is “special,” i.e., whether 
it is possessed by the general public, may also evolve over time and vary from 
one community to another. As a result, courts have not spoken with a clear 
voice regarding what qualifies as a special skill. Courts have upheld imposition 
of the enhancement upon a mechanical drafter whose knowledge of “complex” 
drafting software facilitated his theft of trade secrets (United States v. Lange, 312 
F.3d 263, 270 (7th Cir. 2002)) and upon an intruder who demonstrated an 
ability to “bypass security protocols to gain access to computer systems” (United 
States v. Petersen, 98 F.3d 502, 508 n.5 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that imposition 
of the enhancement is appropriate “[o]nly where a defendant’s computer skills 
are particularly sophisticated”)). See also United States v. O’Brien, 435 F.3d 36 
(1st Cir. 2006) (in section 1030(a)(5) case, upholding sentencing increase based 
on use of special skill because commission of the offense involved knowledge 
of specific computer program, which required special training, and defendant 
had considerable skill in using that program, as demonstrated by fact that he 
taught  class  for  that  program).  On  the  other  hand,  courts  have  overturned 
application of the special skill enhancement to a defendant who copied and 
modified webpage source code to facilitate a fraud scheme (United States v. Lee, 
296 F.3d 792, 799 (9th Cir. 2002)) and a defendant who used off-the-shelf 
software to produce counterfeit currency (United States v. Godman, 223 F.3d 

5. Sentencing 

145

320, 323 (6th Cir. 2000)). If there is coherent precedent to be gleaned from 
this case law, it is that the government must present to the sentencing court 
considerable evidence that the defendant’s uncommon ability facilitated the 
commission or concealment of the crime.

F.  Conditions of Supervised Release

Increasingly,  prosecutors,  parole  officers,  and  courts  struggle  to  impose 
appropriate  conditions  on  the  Internet  use  of  defendants  whose  sentences 
include  terms  of  supervised  release.  Courts  have  circumscribed  discretion 
in imposing such conditions—they may fashion any remedy that takes into 
consideration certain enumerated criteria. See United States v. Holm, 326 F.3d 
872, 876 (7th Cir. 2003); United States v. White, 244 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th 
Cir. 2001); see also 18 U.S.C. §§ 3583(c), 3553 (enumerating the criteria). 
Of  particular  relevance  to  computer  crimes,  courts  must  consider  the  need 
for the sentence imposed “to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct” 
and “to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.” 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3553(a)(2)(B),  (a)(2)(C). Where  a  networked  computer  has  been  used  to 
perpetrate online fraud, to receive contraband such as child pornography or 
stolen credit card numbers, or as the instrument of intrusions into or attacks 
on other computers, these considerations may militate in favor of imposing a 
restriction on computer use as a condition of supervised release.

Section 3553(a) requires that conditions of supervised release impose upon 
a defendant “no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to 
achieve” a valid penological purpose. Holm, 326 F.3d at 876; White, 244 F.3d 
at 1204-05. When such conditions affect a defendant’s use of the Internet, 
a recognized forum for First Amendment activity, this statutory requirement 
takes on constitutional implications. See United States v. Scott, 316 F.3d 733, 
736 (7th Cir. 2003); see generally ACLU v. Reno, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). On a 
more pragmatic level, courts have noted that in an era when the Internet is a 
prevalent means of communication, source of information, and medium for 
commercial transactions and the provision of public services, “a strict ban on 
all Internet use . . . renders modern life . . . exceptionally difficult.” Holm, 326 
F.3d at 878.

As  a  result,  appellate  courts  have  routinely  struck  down  conditions  of 
supervised  release  that  infringe  upon  a  defendant’s  Internet  use  more  than 
necessary and have admonished sentencing courts and parole officers to tailor 

146  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

the conditions more narrowly to the end to be served. See, e.g., United States v. 
Freeman, 316 F.3d 386, 392 (3d Cir. 2003); Scott, 316 F.3d at 737 (suggesting 
as an alternative to a total ban on Internet use unannounced inspections of a 
defendant’s computer); Holm, 326 F.3d at 879 (suggesting random searches 
of  a  defendant’s  computer  and  use  of  filtering  software  as  an  appropriate 
condition for a defendant convicted of possessing child pornography); White, 
244 F.3d at 1204-07. At least one court has suggested, however, that a total 
ban may be appropriate where a defendant’s crime involves using a computer 
to attack or intrude upon others’ networks. See Scott, 316 F.3d at 736 (dicta) 
(“Inveterate intruders who have used access to injure others may be ordered 
to give up the digital world.”). Similarly, courts have not hesitated to uphold 
limitations on computer use that are appropriately circumscribed. See United 
States v. Ristine, 335 F.3d 692 (8th Cir. 2003) (defendant not allowed home 
internet connection and if allowed a computer, would be required to consent 
to unannounced inspections of computer as well as installation of monitoring 
hardware or software); United States v. Crandon, 173 F.3d 122 (3d Cir. 1999) 
(defendant not allowed to use Internet or computer networks unless approved 
by probation officer).

These  cases  suggest  that  prosecutors  and  parole  officers  should  work 
together to propose to sentencing courts conditions of supervised release that 
achieve their objectives while infringing upon defendants’ legitimate Internet 
use with care. They also suggest, however, that if such conditions are reasonably 
crafted to be respectful of defendants’ liberties, they are appropriate and will 
be upheld.

18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(1)
Computer Fraud—Obtaining National Security Information

The crime of accessing a computer to obtain national security information, as 
charged in [Count ___] of the indictment, has four essential elements, which 
are:

One, the defendant[s] knowingly accessed a computer [without 
authorization][exceeding authorized access];

Two, the defendant[s] obtained information that

•	

•	

[has	been	determined	by	the	United	States	government	by	[Executive 
Order][statute] to require protection against unauthorized disclosure 
for reasons of [national defense][foreign relations]]
[restricted	data	regarding	the	design,	manufacture	or	use	of	atomic	
weapons];

Three, the defendant[s] had reason to believe that the information obtained 
could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any 
foreign nation; and

Four, the defendant[s] voluntarily and intentionally1

•	

•	

[[caused to be] [communicated][delivered][transmitted] the information 
to a person not entitled to receive it]
[retained	the	information	and	failed	to	deliver	the	information	to	an

mation].

The government is not required to prove that the information obtained by 
the defendant[s] was in fact used to the injury of the United States or to the 
advantage of any foreign nation.

Specific definitions
The phrase “restricted data” means all data concerning the: (1) design, 
manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; (2) the production of special 
nuclear material; or (3) the use of special nuclear material in the production 
of energy, not declassified or removed pursuant to federal law. (Source: 42 
U.S.C. § 2014(y))

1 The statute uses the term “willfully,” but consistent with Committee Comments to In-

 
struction 7.02, that term has been replaced with the words “voluntarily and intentionally.”

Computer Fraud—Obtaining Confidential Information

The crime of computer fraud to obtain confidential information, as charged 
in [Count ___] of the indictment, has [two][three] essential elements, which 
are:

One, the defendant[s] intentionally accessed a computer [without 
authorization][exceeding authorized access];

Two, the defendant[s] obtained information

•	

•	
•	
•	

[contained	in	a	financial	record	of	[a financial institution][an issuer of

[acted	in	furtherance	of	(describe	criminal	or	tortious	act)]
[obtained	information	having	a	value	exceeding	$5,000.00]].

Specific Definitions
The phrase “consumer reporting agency” means any person or entity which, 
for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages 
in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer 
credit information or other information for the purpose of furnishing 
consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of 

 
2 In most felony cases charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2), element three should be 
submitted to the jury because these facts would increase the statutory maximum penalties. 
See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(c)(2)(B). Any fact (other than a prior conviction) that increases the 
maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). These ag-
gravating factors can be submitted as a formal element or by special interrogatory. Note that 
element three should not be submitted if the government has charged a first time offender of 
section 1030 solely with a misdemeanor, see 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(A), or if it has charged 
a felony offense that allegedly occurred after a conviction for another offense under section 
1030. See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(C). Finally, if requested by a party and if supported by the 
evidence, the court can submit a “greater and lesser included offense” instruction that would 
permit separate findings on the aggravating elements as well as a charge without such findings 
(i.e., a misdemeanor).

held by [a financial institution][an issuer of a credit card] pertaining to a 
customer’s relationship with that entity. (Source: 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(5)).

If desired, the Court may instruct the jury that the phrase “obtained 
information” “includes merely reading the information. There is no 
requirement that the information be copied or transported.” S. Rep. 104-357, 
at 7 (1996), available at 1996 WL 492169. In earlier amendments addressing 
other subsections of section 1030, Congress has also stated that the phrase 
“obtained information” includes the mere observation of the data and does 
not require the government to prove the data was removed from its original 
location or transcribed. See S. Rep. No. 99-432, at 6-7 (1986), reprinted in 
1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479, 2484 and available at 1986 WL 31918. The term 
“information” includes information stored in intangible form. See S. Rep. No. 
357, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1996).

3 In most felony cases charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A), element three, modified 
to conform to the allegations in the indictment, should be submitted to the jury because these 
facts would increase the statutory maximum penalties. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(c)(4)(B), (E)

that allegedly occurred after a conviction for another offense under section 1030. If requested 
by a party and if supported by the evidence, the court can submit a “greater and lesser included

Appendix C
Best Practices for 
Working with Companies

Intrusion crimes can damage or impair the functioning of computers and 
networks. Victims may be the intended targets of the intrusion or third parties 
whose systems are used to carry out unlawful activity, such as universities and 
Internet service providers. After a company reports an intrusion, there are a 
number of “best practices” for law enforcement that can make the relationship 
between law enforcement and companies more productive in the aftermath 
of  a  computer  incident.  The  practices  discussed  here  are  designed  to  be 
implemented in addition to, not in lieu of, the Attorney General Guidelines 
for Victim and Witness Assistance.1 Also, please see appendix E for guides for 
first responders and on the mechanics of seizing computer evidence.

Because  computer  information  systems  are  essential  to  the  everyday 
operation  of  most  businesses,  the  disruption  of  those  services  can  cripple  a 
company. Law enforcement should remain aware of the tension between their 
need to collect evidence for prosecution and the company’s need to resume 
operations as quickly as possible. Also, companies usually wish to avoid the 
negative publicity frequently associated with a breach of network security.

Because victims play an important role in providing computer logs and 
factual testimony regarding the intrusion, we also suggest some “best practices” 
for companies to consider when responding to a network crime. These suggested 
practices are in Appendix D.

In general, law enforcement should seek to build a trusted relationship with 
companies. Keeping these goals in mind will help to obtain timely assistance 
from companies and increase the likelihood of successful prosecutions.

can found at: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publications/welcome.html.

173

 

1.  Protect the Rights of the Victim
Law enforcement should ensure that the victim’s rights under 18 U.S.C. 

§ 3771(a) are honored, including the rights to:
reasonable	protection	from	the	accused
accurate	and	timely	notice	of	court	proceedings	involving	the	crime	
or of any release or escape of the accused

•	
•	

•	 not	be	excluded	from	any	such	public	court	proceeding,	unless	the	
court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially 
altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding

•	 be	heard	at	any	public	proceeding	in	the	district	court	involving	

release, plea, sentencing, or probation
confer	with	the	government	attorney	on	the	case
full	and	timely	restitution	as	provided	in	law

•	
•	
•	 proceedings	free	from	unreasonable	delay
•	 be	treated	with	fairness	and	with	respect	for	the	victim’s	dignity	and	

privacy.

 

2.  Consult with Senior Management
Consulting  with  the  company’s  senior  management  before  undertaking 
investigative  measures  on  the  company’s  network  will  often  pay  dividends. 
Some decisions require the authorization of a company’s senior management. 
For  example,  system  administrators  may  lack  authority  to  consent  to  law 
enforcement activities that will affect business operations. In addition, be aware 
that if the company or its employees are represented by legal counsel in the 
matter, direct contact with those persons may be restricted absent the attorney’s 
consent. This ethical constraint binds Department of Justice attorneys as well 
as the agents operating on their behalf. 

 

3.  Consult with Information Technology Staff
Whenever possible, we suggest consulting with the company’s information 
technology staff about network architecture before implementing investigative 
measures on the network. Working closely with the information technology staff 
will help to obtain important information, including information regarding 
network topology. Helpful information will include the type and version of 
software being run on the network and any peculiarities in the architecture of the 
network, such as proprietary hardware or software. Obtaining this information 

174  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

will help to ensure that law enforcement can obtain all information relevant 
to an investigation and minimize disruption of the company’s network from 
investigative measures.

Specific things to identify in a network include the locations of intrusion 
detection systems, network switches, and firewalls. Also, identify all data logs, 
including the type of data being logged, the size of the log files (to check for 
losing data due to rolling retention), and location of the logs (sent to a log server 
or maintained on the hacked system and subject to compromise themselves).

 

4.  Minimize Disruption to the Company
Law enforcement should make every effort to use investigative measures that 
minimize computer downtime and displacement of a company’s employees. 
Some investigative measures are indispensable despite the inconvenience to a 
company. Other investigative steps may be altered or avoided if they needlessly 
aggravate employees or prolong the damage already suffered by a company. 
For example, rather than seizing compromised computers and depriving the 
company of their use, consider creating an “image” of the system and leaving 
computers in place. Also, consider practical issues such as whether raid jackets 
or other insignia are appropriate to display.

Similarly, although consulting with company system administrators and 
computer experts is essential, avoiding excessive burdens on these personnel 
can help promote the trust and goodwill of the company.

 

5.  Coordinate Media Releases
Investigations and prosecutions of cybercrime cases may entail the release 
of information by law enforcement in press releases or press conferences. All 
press releases and press conferences should be coordinated with the Office of 
Public Affairs at (202) 514-2007.

Additionally, public statements to the news media should also be coordinated 
with  the  company  to  ensure  that  these  statements  do  not  needlessly  reveal 
information harmful to a company. Informing companies of this coordination 
at  an  early  stage  in  the  investigation  is  an  important  step.  Fear  of  damage 
to carefully built reputations is a major reason why companies refrain from 
reporting crime to law enforcement. Law enforcement should take all possible 
measures  to  prevent  unauthorized  releases  of  information  about  pending 
investigations and to punish unauthorized disclosures when they occur.

Appendix C 

175

In return, consider asking the company to allow the investigating agents to 
review any press releases regarding the investigation before issuing them. This 
will prevent the company from releasing information that could damage the 
investigation.

 

6.  Keep the Company Informed About the Investigation
After  conducting  the  initial  on-site  investigation,  law  enforcement  may 
have little direct contact with a company. To the extent possible—recognizing 
the need to guard against disclosure of grand jury information or information 
that could otherwise jeopardize the investigation—keep the company informed 
of the progress of the investigation. In addition, where an arrest is made that 
results in court proceedings, notify the company of all significant court dates 
so company personnel have the opportunity to attend. 

 

7.  Build Relationships Before an Intrusion
Many  companies,  universities,  and  other  victims  are  reluctant  to  report 
cybercrime  incidents  to  law  enforcement  because  they  are  fearful  that  law 
enforcement  will  conduct  an  investigation  in  a  manner  harmful  to  their 
operational  interests  or  because  they  have  misconceptions  about  how  law 
enforcement will conduct an investigation. Such fears and misconceptions can 
more easily be dispelled if law enforcement has a pre-existing relationship with a 
company, rather than having the company’s first contact with law enforcement 
come in the midst of a crisis. For example, forming liaison groups comprised 
of law enforcement and private industry representatives can help bridge gaps 
of mistrust or unfamiliarity and increase future cybercrime reporting by private 
industry.

176  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

Appendix D
Best Practices for Victim 
Response and Reporting

A quick and effective response by a company is critical for stopping an 
ongoing attack and preventing future attacks. Moreover, the use of established 
procedures—including preservation of evidence—and notification to incident-
reporting organizations and/or to law enforcement will help to secure systems 
of other victims or potential victims. Use of the practices discussed below by 
companies may help to minimize damage to computer networks from attacks 
and maximize opportunities to find the attacker.

Because victims play an important role in providing computer logs and 
factual testimony regarding the intrusion, we also suggest some “best practices” 
for  companies  to  consider  when  responding  to  a  network  crime,  including 
reporting  incidents  to  law  enforcement  and  to  data  subjects.  Companies, 
universities, and other organizations should consider these practices as part of 
their contingency planning before they are attacked, so they are prepared to 
respond appropriately when attacked. 

While these practices are designed to assist network operators and system 
administrators, it is important for investigators and prosecutors to be familiar 
with these practices as well. For first-time victims, law enforcement can offer 
advice on prudent steps the victim should take. Law enforcement also may have 
opportunities for outreach to organizations that are considering contingency 
planning for future network attacks or to organizations that are considering 
remedial steps (e.g., changes to company procedures) after they have responded 
to a network crime.

A. 
 

Steps Before Confronting an Intrusion
1.  Be Familiar with Procedures, Practices, and Contacts
Organizations should have procedures in place to handle computer incidents. 
These  procedures  should  be  reviewed  periodically  and  made  available  to  all 
personnel  who  have  system  security  responsibilities.  The  procedures  should 

177

provide specific guidance to follow in the event of a computer incident. Ideally, 
those procedures should specify: who in the organization has lead responsibility 
for internal incident response; who are the points-of-contact inside and outside 
the organization; what criteria will be used to ascertain whether data owners or 
subjects of any data taken by the attackers must be notified; and at what point 
law enforcement and a computer incident-reporting organization should be 
notified. 

 

2.  Consider Using Banners
Real-time  monitoring  of  attacks  is  usually  lawful  if  prior  notice  of  this 
monitoring  is  given  to  all  users.  For  this  reason,  organizations  should 
consider  deploying  written  warnings,  or  “banners,”  on  the  ports  through 
which an intruder is likely to access the organization’s system and on which 
the organization may attempt to monitor an intruder’s communications and 
traffic. If a banner is already in place, it should be reviewed periodically to 
ensure that it is appropriate for the type of potential monitoring that could be 
used in response to a cyberattack. More guidance on banners can be found in 
our manual Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence 
in Criminal Investigations (3d ed. 2009).

B.  Responding to a Computer Incident
 

1.  Make an Initial Identification and Assessment
The first step for an organization is to make an initial identification of the 
type of incident that has occurred or is occurring and to confirm that it is, 
in fact, an incident. The network administrator should determine the nature 
and scope of the problem—i.e., which specific systems were affected and in 
what ways they were affected. Indicators that an intrusion or other incident 
has occurred will typically include evidence that files or logs were accessed, 
created,  modified,  deleted  or  copied,  or  that  user  accounts  or  permissions 
have  been  added  or  altered.  In  the  case  of  a  root-level  intrusion,  attention 
should be paid to any signs that the intruder has gained access to multiple areas 
of  the  system—some  of  which  may  remain  undetected.  Using  network  log 
information, the system administrator should determine: (a) the immediate 
origin of the attack; (b) the identity of servers to which the data were sent (if 
information was transferred); and (c) the identity of any other victims. Care 
should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  such  initial  actions  do  not  unintentionally 

178  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

modify system operations or stored data in a way that could compromise the 
incident response—including a subsequent investigation. 

 

2.  Take Steps to Minimize Continuing Damage
After the scope of the incident has been determined, an organization may 
need to take certain steps to stop continuing damage from an ongoing assault on 
its network. Such steps may include installing filters to block a denial of service 
attack or isolating all or parts of the system. In the case of unauthorized access 
or access that exceeds user authorization, a system administrator may decide 
either to block further illegal access or to watch the illegal activity in order to 
identify the source of the attack and/or learn the scope of the compromise.

The  initial  response  should  include  at  a  minimum  documenting:  users 
currently  logged  on,  current  connections,  processes  running,  all  listening 
sockets and their associated applications. The organization should also image 
the RAM of the attacked systems.

As described below, detailed records should be kept of whatever steps are 
taken to mitigate the damage flowing from an attack and any associated costs 
incurred as a result. Such information may be important for recovery of damages 
from responsible parties and for any subsequent criminal investigation.

 

3.  Notify Law Enforcement
If  at  any  point  during  the  organization’s  response  or  investigation  it 
suspects that the incident constitutes criminal activity, law enforcement should 
be contacted immediately. To the extent permitted by law, information already 
gathered should be shared with law enforcement. As noted above, certain state 
laws may allow a company that reports an intrusion to law enforcement to 
delay  providing  notice  to  data-subjects  if  such  notice  would  impede  a  law 
enforcement investigation.

Companies  should  note  that  law  enforcement  has  legal  tools  that  are 
typically unavailable to victims of attack; these tools can greatly increase the 
chances of identifying and apprehending the attacker. When law enforcement 
arrests and successfully prosecutes an intruder, that intruder is deterred from 
future assaults on the victim. This is a result that technical fixes to the network 
cannot duplicate with the same effectiveness. 

Intrusion victims may believe that they can block out an intruder by fixing 
the exploited vulnerability. However, it is not uncommon for an intruder to 

Appendix D 

179

install a “back door” through which he can continue to access the system after 
the  initial  point  of  compromise  is  repaired.  Catching  and  prosecuting  the 
intruder may be the only method to truly secure the organization’s system from 
future attacks by the culprit. 

In addition, by using the criminal justice system to punish the intruder, 
other would-be intruders may be deterred from attacking the organization’s 
networks. Criminal law enforcement can thus play a significant and long-term 
role in network security.

 

4.  Do Not Hack into or Damage the Source Computer
Although it may be tempting to do so (especially if the attack is ongoing), 
the  company  should  not  take  any  offensive  measures  on  its  own,  such  as 
“hacking back” into the attacker’s computer—even if such measures could in 
theory be characterized as “defensive.” Doing so may be illegal, regardless of 
the motive. Further, as most attacks are launched from compromised systems 
of unwitting third parties, “hacking back” can damage the system of another 
innocent party. If appropriate, however, the company’s system administrator 
can contact the system administrator from the attacking computer to request 
assistance in stopping the attack or in determining its true point of origin.

Image the Drive

5.  Record and Collect Information
 
 
 
A system administrator for the company should consider making an im-
 
mediate identical copy of the affected system, which will preserve a record of 
the system at the time of the incident for later analysis. This copy should be a 
“system level” or “zero level” copy and not just a copy of user files. In addition, 
any previously-generated backup files should be located. New or sanitized me-
dia should be used to store copies of any data that is retrieved and stored. Once 
such copies are made, the media should be write-protected to guard it from 
alteration. In addition, access to this media should be controlled to maintain 
the integrity of the copy’s authenticity, to keep undetected insiders away from 
it, and to establish a simple chain of custody. These steps will enhance the value 
of any backups as evidence in any later internal investigations, civil suits, or 
criminal prosecutions.

180  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

 

  Notes, Records, and Data
As  the  investigation  progresses,  information  that  was  collected  by  the 
company  contemporaneous  to  the  events  may  take  on  great  significance. 
Immediate steps should be taken to preserve relevant logs that already exist. 
In  addition,  those  persons  participating  in  the  incident  response  should  be 
directed to keep an ongoing, written record of all steps undertaken. If this is 
done at or near the time of the events, the participants can minimize the need 
to rely on their memories or the memories of others to reconstruct the order 
of events. 

The  types  of  information  that  should  be  recorded  by  the  company 

include:

•	

•	 description	of	all	incident-related	events,	including	dates	and	times
•	
information	about	incident-related	phone	calls,	emails,	and	other	
contacts
the	identity	of	persons	working	on	tasks	related	to	the	intrusion,	
including a description, the amount of time spent, and the 
approximate hourly rate for those persons’ work
identity	of	the	systems,	accounts,	services,	data,	and	networks	affected	
by the incident, and a description of how these network components 
were affected
information	relating	to	the	amount	and	type	of	damage	inflicted	by	
the incident, which can be important in civil actions by the company 
and in criminal cases.

•	

•	

Ideally, a single person should be provided copies of all such records. This 
will help to ensure that the records are properly preserved and capable of being 
produced later on. It is often crucial to the success of a legal proceeding to defeat 
any claim that records or other evidence may have been altered subsequent to 
their creation. This is best accomplished by establishing a continuous “chain 
of custody” from the time that records were made until the time they were 
brought into the court.

 

6.  Record and Log Continuing Attacks
 When an attack is ongoing or when a system has been infected by a virus 
or worm, this continuing activity should be recorded or logged by the victim. If 
logging is not underway, it should begin immediately. Increase default log file size 
to prevent losing data. A system administrator may be able to use a “sniffer” 
or other monitoring device to record communications between the intruder 

Appendix D 

181

and any server that is under attack. Such monitoring is usually permissible, 
provided that it is done to protect the rights and property of the system under 
attack, the user specifically consented to such monitoring, or implied consent 
was  obtained  from  the  intruder—e.g.,  by  means  of  notice  or  a  “banner.” 
More guidance on banners can be found in our manual Searching and Seizing 
computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations (3d ed. 
2009).

A  banner  should  notify  users  or  intruders  as  they  access  or  log  into  a 
system that their continued use of the system constitutes their consent to being 
monitored and that the results of such monitoring may be disclosed to law 
enforcement and others. Legal counsel at the company should be consulted to 
make sure such monitoring is consistent with employment agreements, privacy 
policies, and legal authorities and obligations.

 

7.  Do Not Use the Compromised System to Communicate
The  company  should  avoid,  to  the  extent  reasonably  possible,  using  a 
system suspected of being compromised to communicate about an incident 
or to discuss incident response. If the compromised system must be used to 
communicate,  all  relevant  communications  should  be  encrypted.  To  avoid 
being  the  victim  of  social  engineering  and  risking  further  damage  to  the 
organization’s network, employees of the company should not disclose incident-
specific information to callers who are not known points-of-contact, unless the 
employee can verify the identity and authority of those persons. Suspicious 
calls, emails, or other requests for information should be treated as part of the 
incident investigation. 

 

8.  Notify

 

People Within the Organization

 
Appropriate people in the organization should be notified immediately about 
the incident and provided with the results of any preliminary investigation. 
This  may  include  security  coordinators,  managers,  and  legal  counsel.  (A 
written policy for incident response should set out points-of-contact within 
the organization and the circumstances for contacting them.) When making 
these contacts, only protected or reliable channels of communication should be 
used. If the company suspects that the perpetrator of an attack is an insider, or 
may have insider information, the company may wish to strictly limit incident 
information to a need-to-know basis.

182  

Prosecuting Computer Crimes

 

  Computer Incident-reporting Organization
Whenever  possible,  the  company  should  notify  an  incident-reporting 
organization,  such  as  a  Computer  Emergency  Response  Team  (CERT). 
Reporting  the  incident  and  the  means  of  attack  may  help  to  hamper  the 
attacker’s ability to replicate the intrusion against other target systems. 

The  United  States  Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team  (US-CERT) 
is  a  partnership  between  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the 
public and private sectors. Established in 2003 to protect the nation’s Internet 
infrastructure,  US-CERT  is  charged  with  coordinating  defense  against 
and  response  to  cyber  attacks.  US-CERT  interacts  with  federal  agencies, 
industry, the research community, state and local governments, and others to 
disseminate reasoned and actionable cyber security information to the public. 
US-CERT also provides a way for citizens, businesses, and other institutions to 
communicate and coordinate directly with the United States government about 
cyber security. Reporting intrusions may not only help protect the company’s 
system from further damage, it could also help to alert other actual or potential 
victims who otherwise might not be aware of the suspicious activity. They can 
be contacted on the Internet at http://www.us-cert.gov.

 

  Other Potential Victims
If there is another organization, or a vulnerability in a vendor’s product 
that is being exploited, it may be prudent for the company to notify the victim 
or vendor to request that an incident-reporting organization or CERT alert the 
victim or vendor. The third-party victim or vendor may be able to provide new 
and previously unknown information about the incident (e.g., hidden code, 
ongoing investigations in other areas, or network configuration techniques). 
Such notification may prevent further damage to other systems.

Note also that state laws may require companies to notify people whose 
data is compromised during an intrusion. For example, California law requires 
that:

[a]ny person or business that conducts business in California, 
and  that  owns  or  licenses  computerized  data  that  includes 
personal information, shall disclose any breach of the security 
of the system following discovery or notification of the breach 
in the security of the data to any resident of California whose 

Appendix D 

183

unencrypted  personal  information  was,  or  is  reasonably 
believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.

Cal. Civil Code § 1798.82(a). As of January 2010, at least forty-five states have 
passed  database  breach  notification  laws.1  Some  of  the  state  laws  allow  for 
notice to be delayed if it would impede a criminal investigation. See Fla. Stat. § 
817.5681(3) (2005); Conn. S.B. 650 § 3(d).

At least one state law allows the database owner to elect against providing 
notice to data subjects if the database owner consults with law enforcement 
and thereafter determines that the breach “will not likely result in harm to 
the individuals whose personal information has been acquired and accessed.” 
Conn. S.B. 650 § 3(b).

C.  After a Computer Incident

A  critical  action  after  an  intrusion  and  its  associated  investigation  are 
complete is to take steps to prevent similar attacks from happening again. In 
order to keep similar incidents from occurring, victims should do conduct a 
post-incident review of the organization’s response to the attack and assessment 
of the strengths and weaknesses of this response. Part of the assessment should 
include ascertaining whether each of the steps outlined above occurred.
